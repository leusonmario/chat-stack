","You can use bind mounts when building you docker container,
See https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/
you specify a directory inside your container which will be mounted on a local directory on your host, this way all container write operations are mounted directly to your host directory.
I'd recommand doint it using docker-compose, for example below:
container directory /opt/Projects/01_MyProject will be mounted to host directory /Volumes/Partition_2/Docker-Volumes/Volume_1,
#docker-compose.yml
...
    volumes:
      - PERSIST_DATA:/opt/Projects/01_MyProject
volumes:
  PERSIST_DATA:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      o: bind
      type: none
      device: /Volumes/Partition_2/Docker-Volumes/Volume_1

This way, you can copy anything to /Volumes/Partition_2/Docker-Volumes/Volume_1, which will show up under /opt/Projects/01_MyProject
","  Yes, there are several ways to efficiently transfer data between the host and container, especially when you need to do it in an automated and repeating manner. Here are some ideas:
1. volumes: One of the simplest ways to transfer data between the host and container is by using volumes. Containerization tools like Docker provide the ability to mount a directory from the host into the container, allowing you to transfer data between the two. You can mount a directory on the host as a volume and access it from within the container. To create a volume, you can use the `-v` flag when creating the container, like this:
```
$ docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-container
```
In this example, the `-v` flag tells Docker to map the `/path/on/host` directory on the host to `/path/in/container` inside the container. You can then access the data in the container by using the full path inside the container, e.g., `/path/in/container/mydata`.
2. NFS: Another option is to use the NFS (Network File System) protocol to transfer data between the host and container. NFS is a protocol that allows you to mount a directory from one host to another over a network. To use NFS with Docker, you can mount an NFS share on the host and access it from within the container. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
$ docker run -v $NFS_SHARE:/path/in/container my-container
```
In this example, `$NFS_SHARE` is the path to the NFS share on the host that you want to mount inside the container, and `/path/in/container` is the directory inside the container where you want to write the data.
3. Git: If you're using Git for version control, you can use Git's `git archive` command to transfer data between the host and container. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
$ docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container --git /path/on/host/mydata.git my-container
```
In this example, the `-v` flag is used to mount the `/path/on/host` directory on the host inside the container, and the `--git` flag is used to mount a Git repository at `/path/on/host/mydata.git`. You can then use Git commands inside the container to retrieve and update the data.
4. Data Transfer Services: There are also several third-party data transfer services that can help you transfer data between the host and container, such as AWS DataSync, Google Cloud Transfer Service, or Microsoft Azure Data Factory. These services usually provide a simple API or command-line interface that you can use to transfer data between the host and container.
In summary, you have several options to transfer data between the host and container efficiently, including volumes, NFS, Git, and data transfer services. The best option for you will depend on your specific use case and requirements.",0.7028242349624634,"docker, containers",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

This way, you can copy anything to /Volumes/Partition_2/Docker-Volumes/Volume_1, which will show up under /opt/Projects/01_MyProject
","To efficiently copy data from the host to the container, you can make use of Docker volumes. Docker volumes provide a way to persist and share data between the host machine and the container.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Create a Docker volume: 
   - Use the following command to create a named volume: `docker volume create <volume_name>`

2. Mount the volume to the container:
   - In your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml, specify the volume to be mounted to the desired directory inside the container. For example:
     ```
     volumes:
       - <volume_name>:<container_directory>
     ```

3. Copy the data to the volume:
   - On the host machine, copy the required data to the volume using the Docker CLI command `docker cp`. For example:
     ```
     docker cp <host_directory>/. <volume_name>:<container_directory>
     ```

4. Trigger the training process:
   - Once the data is copied to the container, you can trigger the training process using your main application running on the host machine. You can communicate with the container through the Docker API or by executing commands inside the container using the Docker CLI.

By using Docker volumes, you can automate the process of copying different datasets to the container for training, as the volume will persist across container restarts. This allows you to repeatedly transfer data without the need for manual transport via bash or other methods.

Note: Since your host machine is Windows and the container is Linux, you may need to take care of any line-ending differences or file path formatting issues that could arise during the data transfer.",0.7133537530899048,"docker, containers",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

error: could not compile `vectors` due to previous error

","The move is not within ne(), and thus borrowing it there will not solve the problem (also, to borrow it you need to do (&amp;mut name).ne(&quot;exit&quot;); &amp;mut name.ne(&quot;exit&quot;) will borrow the result of ne() mutably). ne() borrows the value with a shared reference.
The move, as the compiler tells you, is within vec.push(name). Here we move name, and any further attempt to access it is an error. But in the next round of the loop we'll try to do exactly that to compare it with &quot;exit&quot;!
There are generally two solutions to that:

Clone the string and push the cloned string to the vector, leaving the original unmodified.

vec.push(name.clone());


Instead of checking name directly, check the last value in the vector. We need to be careful to not assume there is such value, because the vector is empty in the beginning of the first iteration:

let mut vec = Vec::&lt;String&gt;::new();

while vec.last().map(|v| &amp;**v) != Some(&quot;exit&quot;) {
    let mut name = String::new();

    print!(&quot;Enter a name&quot;);
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut name)
        .expect(&quot;failed to readline&quot;);

    print!(&quot;You entered {}&quot;, name);

    vec.push(name);
    println!(&quot;length of vector is {}&quot;, vec.len());

    for i in &amp;vec {
        println!(&quot;name in vector is {}&quot;, i);
    }
}

But in your case, it is more likely that you don't want to push &quot;exit&quot; into the Vec at all. So, it is better to use loop with break:
let mut vec = Vec::&lt;String&gt;::new();
loop {
    let mut name = String::new();
    print!(&quot;Enter a name&quot;);
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut name)
        .expect(&quot;failed to readline&quot;);

    if name == &quot;exit&quot; {
        break;
    }

    print!(&quot;You entered {}&quot;, name);

    vec.push(name);
    println!(&quot;length of vector is {}&quot;, vec.len());

    for i in &amp;vec {
        println!(&quot;name in vector is {}&quot;, i);
    }
}

","  The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `name` variable is moved inside the loop, so it's no longer a reference to the original value but a separate copy of it. Rust's borrow checker is warning you that you're trying to borrow a value that has been moved, which is not allowed.
To fix this, you can use a mutable reference to the `name` variable instead of a borrowed reference. Here's an updated version of your code that should compile:
```
use std::io;
fn main() {
    let mut name = String::new();
    let mut vec = Vec::new();

    while name.ne(&quot;exit&quot;) {
        print!(&quot;Enter a name&quot;); 
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut name).expect(&quot;failed to readline&quot;);

        print!(&quot;You entered {}&quot;, name); 

        vec.push(name); 
        println!(&quot;length of vector is {}&quot;, vec.len());

        for i in &vec {
            println!(&quot;name in vector is {}&quot;, i);
        }  
    }

}
```
In this version, I've changed the loop to use a mutable reference to `name`, like this:
```
    while &mut name.ne(&quot;exit&quot;) {
        // ...
    }

```
This tells Rust that you want to borrow the `name` variable mutably, rather than as a reference. This allows you to modify the original variable inside the loop without producing any borrowing errors.
Note that using a mutable reference also means that the `name` variable will be mutated inside the loop, which could potentially lead to unexpected side effects if you're not careful. So be sure to use immutable references or copies of the `name` variable if you don't want to modify it inside the loop.",0.6424606442451477,rust,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    }
}

","The issue you're facing is related to ownership and borrowing in Rust. In your code, you're trying to push the variable `name` into the vector `vec` in each iteration of the loop. However, you're encountering an error because you're trying to move the ownership of `name` to the vector multiple times, which is not allowed.

To fix this problem and properly handle ownership and borrowing, you can make a few modifications to your code:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut name = String::new();
    let mut vec = Vec::new();

    loop {
        print!(""Enter a name: "");
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut name).expect(""Failed to read line"");

        let trimmed_name = name.trim().to_string(); // Trim the input to remove newlines and spaces

        if trimmed_name == ""exit"" {
            break; // Exit the loop if the input is ""exit""
        }

        println!(""You entered: {}"", trimmed_name);

        vec.push(trimmed_name.clone()); // Clone the trimmed name and push it into the vector
        println!(""Length of vector is: {}"", vec.len());

        for i in &vec {
            println!(""Name in vector is: {}"", i);
        }

        name.clear(); // Clear the input string for the next iteration
    }
}
```

In this modified code, we use a `loop` instead of a `while` loop to allow for easier control flow. We also introduce a `trimmed_name` variable to hold the trimmed version of the input string, removing any leading or trailing whitespaces.

To avoid moving the ownership of `name`, we clone `trimmed_name` before pushing it into the vector. This way, the vector takes ownership of the cloned string, allowing us to reuse `name` for the next iteration by calling `name.clear()`.

By making these changes, you should be able to compile and run the code without any issues.",0.6142231225967407,rust,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Yes, you are correct that the `key` function in the example you provided only detects mouse click events and not key press events.

Note that the ` keyPress` event is used instead of `Key` event, as the latter is not supported in all versions of tkinter.

","To detect a key press when a mouse click happens in a tkinter canvas, you can use the `event.state` attribute in the callback function. Here's an updated version of your code that demonstrates this:

```python
from tkinter import *

root = Tk()

def key(event):
    if event.state == 1:  # Check if the Shift key is pressed (state = 1)
        print(""Shift key pressed"")

def callback(event):
    print(""Clicked at"", event.x, event.y)

canvas = Canvas(root, width=100, height=100)
canvas.bind(""<Key>"", key)
canvas.bind(""<Button-1>"", callback)
canvas.focus_set()  # Set focus to the canvas so that it can receive key events
canvas.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

In this code, we check the `event.state` attribute in the `key` function to see if the Shift key is pressed. The state value of 1 corresponds to the Shift key being pressed. If the Shift key is pressed, we print the message ""Shift key pressed"". Otherwise, no action is taken.

Additionally, I added the `canvas.focus_set()` line to set the focus on the canvas. This allows the canvas to receive key events. Without this line, the canvas may not receive key events by default.

Now, when you click on the canvas and press the Shift key simultaneously, the program will print ""Shift key pressed"" in the console.",0.7822381258010864,"python, tkinter, tkinter-canvas",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I've just started using Apache POI like 4 hours ago and wanted to:

Locate different strings inside a Word-Document (.docx/XWPF)
Replace the strings with the value of the map
Make the value appear bold, if the string has a special flag.

I tried to first approach this by iterating over the paragraph (not the Runs), but it didn't work. I've got my current solution from this post right here.
Everything is fine with the first two steps, now I want to make every value that contains a special flag (like ${key:bold} or ${score:bold}) bold. I've tried to create a new XWPFRun that writes the bold string, it just won't work with the code underneath...

","I got this working the other day!
The best way to make it bold is to make the format-indicator bold in the document itself.
The other way is to create a new XWPFRun and set it to bold. The text should be the value of the key. After that, you can just add all the fixed XWPFRuns into an ArrayList and re-insert them, after removing every run in the selected paragraph. You can then just remove the old-normal XWPFRun that contains the format-indicator.
","  No problem! To make a string inside a sentence bold using Apache POI, you can use the `XWPFRun` class to add a bold element to the run.

In the `replaceParagraph` method, we first get the list of runs in the paragraph using the `getRuns` method. Then, we iterate through the runs and check if they contain the special flag `${key:bold}`. If they do, we create a new `XWPFRun` element with the bold flag set to `true` using the `addRun` method of the `XWPFParagraph` class. We then remove the original run from the paragraph using the `removeRun` method.
Note that we're using the `contains` method to check if the run contains the special flag. If it does, we use the `substring` method to extract the key and the `indexOf` method to check if the run contains the `}` character that closes the tag. If the run doesn't contain the `}` character, we know that the flag is nested inside the run, and we can use the `substring` method to extract the key and the `indexOf` method to check if the run contains the `}` character that opens the tag.
Also, note that we're using the `contains` method to check if the run contains the special flag, rather than using the `startsWith` method. This is because the special flag may appear anywhere inside the run, not just at the beginning.

In this updated code, we iterate over the runs in the paragraph and check if the run contains the target string to be replaced (e.g., `${key}`). If it does, we retrieve the corresponding format object and handle the value. If the format object has the `bold` flag set to `true`, we create a new run with bold formatting, insert it after the current run, and remove the original run. If the `bold` flag is `false`, we replace the text in the existing run with the handled value.

","  Yes, you can use the `subprocess` module in Python to run a bash shell directly from Python, without creating a temporary file or piping output to a new process. You can use the `Popen` method to start a new process and pass the necessary arguments to the bash shell directly.
Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
import os
# Start the bash shell directly
bash = subprocess.Popen(['/bin/bash'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
# Write to the bash shell directly
print(""hello world"")
# Reading from the bash shell
output = bash.communicate()[0]
print(output)
```
In this example, we use the `Popen` method to start a new process with the `/bin/bash` command directly. The `stdout` parameter is set to `subprocess.PIPE` to allow us to read output from the bash shell directly.
We then write to the bash shell using the `print()` function, and read the output using the `communicate()` method. The output is stored in the `output` variable and can be printed or processed further.
Note that this approach does not allow you to interact with the bash shell directly, as the `subprocess.Popen` method creates a new process and does not allow for communication between the parent and child processes. If you need to interact with the bash shell, you would need to use a different approach, such as piping output to the bash shell or using a different process model, such as `subprocess.Popen` with `stdin=subprocess.PIPE`.
It's also worth noting that this approach is not as convenient as using `pwntools`, as it does not provide a convenient way to automate the CTF challenge. However, it can be useful in certain situations where you need to interact with a shell directly from Python.",0.703446090221405,"python, python-3.x",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To achieve dropping into a shell from Python without using `subprocess` or `pwntools`, you can make use of the `pty` module. The `pty` module provides pseudo-terminal handling for Unix platforms, allowing you to interact with a shell session.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```python
import os
import pty

# Spawn a new pseudo-terminal
pty.spawn(""/bin/bash"")

print(""hello world"")  # assume I am writing to a file

# To resume the shell, you can try sending the `fg` command via the pseudo-terminal
os.write(1, b'fg\n')
```

By using `pty.spawn(""/bin/bash"")`, you will start a new shell session. The `os.write(1, b'fg\n')` line sends the `fg` command to the shell, which attempts to resume the suspended shell process.

What I have done so far
By checking whether each cell in the owner column have a &quot;,&quot; or not (implying this is a list), if it contains &quot;,&quot;, I convert it into an array and duplicate the row to the amount of length of the array minus 1 and later modify each row of that column into the order of and array. (Please see the code).
function myFunction() {
  var ws = SpreadsheetApp.openById(&quot;SHEET ID&quot;);
  var ss = ws.getSheetByName('SHEET NAME');
  var r = ss.getRange(&quot;A1:E20000&quot;);
  r.activate;
  var v = r.getValues();
  for (var i=1;i&lt;=20000;i++){
    if(v[i-1][3].includes(&quot;,&quot;)){ 
      var temp = v[i-1][3].split(&quot;, &quot;);
      ss.insertRows(i,temp.length-1);
      for (var j = 0; j&lt;temp.length; j++ ){
        ss.getRange(i+temp.length-1,1,1,5).copyTo(ss.getRange(i+j,1,1,5));
        ss.getRange(i+j,3).setValue(temp[j]);
        }
        i = i+temp.length-1;
        }
    r.activate;
    v = r.getValues();
      }
      }

What being problematic
The loop stopped right after when they fix the first case of the issue. For instance, based on the mock table, the first case is on the row 2. After fixing the row 2, the later case after row 2 are not affected by the code anymore.
My assumption right now is that I insert the new row which change the referenced position. But I stuck here. Any kind of suggestions is appreciated.

","  Thank you for providing more details about your issue. It seems that you are trying to update the ""Owner(s)"" column in your Google Sheet by duplicating rows based on a list of users in that column, and then updating the owner for each row. Here's a possible solution to help you achieve this:
Instead of using a loop to duplicate rows and update the owner, you can use a single loop to perform both operations. Here's an updated version of your function that does this:
function myFunction() {
// Declare variables
var ws = SpreadsheetApp.openById(""SHEET ID"");
var ss = ws.getSheetByName(""SHEET NAME"");
var r = ss.getRange(""A1:E20000"");
var v = r.getValues();
// Find all rows where the ""Owner(s)"" column contains a list of users
var owningRows = v.filter(function(row) {
return row[3].includes("","");
});
// Duplicate each owning row and update the owner
for (var i = 0; i < owningRows.length; i++) {
var row = owningRows[i];
// Duplicate the row and update the owner
ss.insertRows(i + 1, 1);
var newRow = ss.getRange(i + 1, 1, 1, 5);
newRow.setValues([row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3].split("","")[0], row[3].split("","")[1]]);
// Update the owner in the original row
ss.getRange(row[0], 3).setValue(row[3].split("","")[0]);
ss.getRange(row[0], 4).setValue(row[3].split("","")[1]);
}
// Update the values in the ""Owner(s)"" column
r.activate;
v = r.getValues();
}
In this updated version of the function, we first find all rows where the ""Owner(s)"" column contains a list of users by using the `filter()` method. We then loop through each of these rows and duplicate the row, updating the owner in the original row and its duplicates.

  for (var i = 1; i <= v.length; i++) { // iterate through each row in the range
    if (v[i-1][3].includes("","")) { // check if the Owner(s) column contains a comma
      var temp = v[i-1][3].split("",""); // split the string by comma to get individual owners
      var numOwners = temp.length; // get the number of owners
      
      // duplicate the row for each owner (excluding the first one)

        numRowsInserted++;
        ss.getRange(i + numRowsInserted, 1, 1, 5).setValues([v[i-1]]); // copy the values from the original row

      // modify the Owner(s) column in the original row
      ss.getRange(i, 4).setValue(temp[0].trim());
    }
  }
}
```

In this modified code, I've introduced a new variable `numRowsInserted` to keep track of the number of inserted rows. This allows us to dynamically calculate the position of the new rows and update the range accordingly. The `insertRowAfter()` method is used to insert a new row after the current row, and the `setValues()` method is used to copy the values from the original row to the new row.

Additionally, I've made a small change to the inner loop condition (`j < numOwners`) to exclude the first owner, as it is already handled in the original row.

By using these modifications, the loop will continue to iterate correctly and update the range even after inserting new rows.

I have some .mat files named

results_3x3.mat


results_5x5.mat

and so on..
I am importing that files with load function. But since that I have 20 files I need to do it in a for loop.  filterSize=3:2:41
I need to use the load function in MATLAB with variables.
I am now doing it manually as follows:
F1_score_3 = load('results_3x3.mat');
accuracy_3 = F1_score_3.accuracy;

F1_score_5 = load('results_5x5.mat');
accuracy_5 = F1_score_5.accuracy;

F1_score_7 = load('results_7x7.mat');

F1_score_3 = load('results_&amp;s.mat',sz); doesn't work.
Can you help me with this? Also, can I define variables with another variable in them? Such as
F1_score_%d, filterSize

","Do not create dynamic variable names that contain numbers like this. They will be hard to work with downstream in your code. It would be better to store the results in an array or cell or struct. E.g., you could do something like this using a cell array:
F1_score = cell(41,1);
for filterSize=3:2:41
    fname = sprintf( 'results_%dx%d.mat', filterSize, filterSize );
    F1_score{filterSize} = load(fname);
end

Then when you want to get at accuracy, you can use indexing as usual. E.g.,
F1_score{3}.accuracy

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with loading multiple mat files using the `load` function in MATLAB with dynamic variable `filterSize`. Here's a solution that you can use:
First, you can define a function that loads the mat file using the `load` function with a dynamic variable for the file name:
```matlab
function F1_score = load_mat(filename, filterSize)
    % Load the mat file using the load function
    F1_score = load(filename);
    % Extract the accuracy value from the F1_score variable
    accuracy = F1_score.accuracy;

end
```
Next, you can use the `for` loop to iterate over the list of files and load each file using the `load_mat` function:
```matlab
% Define the list of files
fileList = {'results_3x3.mat', 'results_5x5.mat', 'results_7x7.mat'};
% Initialize the variable for the accuracy values
F1_score = [];

% Loop over the list of files and load each file using the load_mat function
for filename = fileList
    F1_score = load_mat(filename, filterSize);

    % Extract the accuracy value from the F1_score variable
    accuracy = F1_score.accuracy;

    % Append the accuracy value to the F1_score variable
    F1_score = [F1_score, accuracy];

end
```
In the above code, you can see that I have defined a variable `fileList` that contains the list of files that you want to load. Then, I have defined a function `load_mat` that loads the mat file using the `load` function with a dynamic variable for the file name. In the `load_mat` function, I have extracted the accuracy value from the `F1_score` variable using the `accuracy` field. Finally, I have used a `for` loop to iterate over the list of files and load each file using the `load_mat` function.
Regarding your second question, yes, you can define variables with another variable in them in MATLAB. For example, you can define a variable `F1_score_%d` that contains the accuracy value for the file with the name `results_%d.mat` where `%d` is a dynamic variable that takes the value of `filterSize`. Here's an example:
```matlab
F1_score_filterSize = [];
% Loop over the list of files and load each file using the load_mat function
for filename = fileList
    F1_score = load_mat(filename, filterSize);

    % Define the variable for the accuracy value
    F1_score_%d = [F1_score, F1_score.accuracy];

    % Update the F1_score_%d variable
    F1_score_filterSize = [F1_score_filterSize, F1_score_%d];

end
```
In the above code, I have defined a variable `F1_score_filterSize` that contains the accuracy value for all the files with the name `results_%d.mat` where `%d` is a dynamic variable that takes the value of `filterSize`.

","Yes, I can help you with that. To load the .mat files in a for loop and assign the loaded data to variables with dynamic names, you can use the following code:

```matlab
filterSize = 3:2:41;
numFiles = numel(filterSize);

for i = 1:numFiles
    sz = sprintf('%dx%d', filterSize(i), filterSize(i));
    fileName = sprintf('results_%dx%d.mat', filterSize(i), filterSize(i));
    
    loadedData = load(fileName);
    variableName = sprintf('F1_score_%d', filterSize(i));
    eval([variableName ' = loadedData.accuracy;']);
end
```

In this code, the `filterSize` variable is defined as an array of filter sizes. The `numFiles` variable is used to determine the number of iterations in the for loop.

Inside the loop, the `sz` variable is created using the current filter size. The `fileName` variable is created by concatenating the filter size with the file name pattern.

The `load` function is used to load the .mat file into the `loadedData` variable. Then, a dynamic variable name is created using the `filterSize` value, and the loaded accuracy data is assigned to that variable using `eval()` function.

By using this approach, you can dynamically load the .mat files and assign the loaded data to variables with names like `F1_score_3`, `F1_score_5`, etc.

Please note that using `eval()` can be risky in certain situations, so make sure you are loading files from trusted sources. Additionally, it's recommended to use a cell array or structure instead of dynamically creating variables with different names.",0.7623692750930786,"matlab, variables, load",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Extracting a string between other two strings in R
Extract a string between patterns/delimiters in R
The problem I am facing is the following. Say we have a vector like this:
vec &lt;- c(&quot;Europe/Germany/Berlin/Mitte&quot;, 
         &quot;Europe/Germany/Berlin/Charlottenburg&quot;, 
         &quot;Europe/Croatia/Zagreb/Gornji Grad&quot;, 
         &quot;Europe/Croatia/Zagreb/Donji Grad&quot;)

Can you provide me with the following two functions:
The output of the first function should be:
c(&quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Croatia&quot;, &quot;Croatia&quot;)

And the output of the second function should be:
c(&quot;Berlin&quot;, &quot;Berlin&quot;, &quot;Zagreb&quot;, &quot;Zagreb&quot;)

I don't understand how the answers from previous questions apply when the delimiter / appears more than once in the string and how can I specify which of the pieces I want.

Get position 3
get_name(3)
[1] &quot;Berlin&quot; &quot;Berlin&quot; &quot;Zagreb&quot; &quot;Zagreb&quot;

","To extract the substring between two delimiters when there are multiple instances of the same delimiter, you can use the `strsplit()` function in R along with regular expressions.

Here are two functions that can help you achieve the desired outputs:

```R
getCountry <- function(vec) {
  country <- sapply(strsplit(vec, ""/""), function(x) x[2])
  return(country)
}

getCity <- function(vec) {
  city <- sapply(strsplit(vec, ""/""), function(x) x[length(x) - 1])
  return(city)
}
```

Explanation:
- The `strsplit()` function splits each element of the vector `vec` using the delimiter ""/"".
- The `sapply()` function applies a function to each element of the resulting list.
- In the `getCountry()` function, we extract the second element of each split string, which represents the country.
- In the `getCity()` function, we extract the second-to-last element of each split string, which represents the city.

You can use these functions as follows:

```R
vec <- c(""Europe/Germany/Berlin/Mitte"",
         ""Europe/Germany/Berlin/Charlottenburg"",
         ""Europe/Croatia/Zagreb/Gornji Grad"",
         ""Europe/Croatia/Zagreb/Donji Grad"")

country <- getCountry(vec)
city <- getCity(vec)

print(country)
print(city)
```

Output:
```
[1] ""Germany"" ""Germany"" ""Croatia"" ""Croatia""
[1] ""Berlin""   ""Berlin""   ""Zagreb""   ""Zagreb""
```

These functions split the strings based on the ""/"" delimiter and extract the desired parts based on their positions in the split string.",0.6532596349716187,r,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Live Timer in React App
Sorry, my first post here. So, I'm not allowed to show image directly hence image is added as link.
Questions:
1, I'm not allowed to access Tos window object directly. Hence I accessed it like &quot;window.Tos&quot; in React root index.html  Is it the right approach to fetch third party object in React?
2, Is it proper way to include the HTML block,
&lt;span id=&quot;timeonsite&quot; style=&quot;color:#f55;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt; Seconds

or the right way would be write it as React component?
3, I added the powerful
setInterval(function() {}, 1000);

JS Interval function. Is it fine or we can use React inbuilt timer function for updating TIMER &quot;div&quot; each second?
FYI, I will need this Tos JS object in every page in my React web app so that I show how much time the user spent in the app so far in web page. If it can be written as React component, could you show a sample component written for this live time-counter. I've seen one other question in SO raising the same question but that used JS date timer directly instead of full-fledged tracker like timeonsite.js. Thanks for your help.
","Let's try to give you some answers:

I'm not allowed to access Tos window object directly. Hence I accessed
it like &quot;window.Tos&quot; in React root index.html Is it the right approach
to fetch third party object in React?

As long as you declare Tos as a global variable you should be able to access it from all the scopes. But more importantly there are several ways of achieving what you want.
To add a third-party object in React you can:

add it as you did in the index.html file, the approach you took. The issue here is that then to have some communication between the third party library and your react code it can only happen through global variables which could be a bad pattern.
Using some kind of webpack plugin for your cdn. But this will present the same issue as the previous approach. It just looks cleaner.
Add onMount the script:

function App() {
  // Proof that we can use Tos object
  const click = () =&gt; {
    console.log('Click', Tos)
    Tos
  }
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // This is the same that your script does but in a &quot;React&quot; way
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
    script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
    script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {

        const config = {
          trackBy: 'seconds',
          developerMode: true,
          callback: function(data) {
            console.log(data);

          }
        };
        if(TimeOnSiteTracker) {
         // IF this was not a `var` it will not be a global scoped variable
          var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
          window.Tos = Tos;
        }

    })
    document.body.appendChild(script)
  }, [])
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={click}&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

Using useEffect we can basically mount the 3rd-party library on the mount lifecycle. In this last approach, you have more control over the parameters that you pass to the library, they can even be more dynamic and easier to interact as you will see in the answer to your 3rd question.

Is it proper way to include the HTML block,
or the right way would be write it as React component?

To get the power of react (rendering, performance control over components) the best thing will be to move this code into the JSX of your app. This way this element will be dynamically added and not hard coded as in your approach.

I added the powerful setInterval(function() {}, 1000); JS Interval function. Is it fine or
we can use React inbuilt timer function for updating TIMER &quot;div&quot; each
second?

Actually given the API of Timeonsite.js, there is no better way of doing this (some may think that callback argument is called every time there is an update, but no, only on start and onload. Also, if we check what the developermode does, it basically calls Tos every second using the interval:
if (this.developerMode) {
        setInterval(function() {
            self.showProgress();
        }, (1 * 1000));
    }

To do this in a React friendly way:
 const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
        console.log(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
    }, 1000);
    return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

And then in the JSX:
 &lt;div&gt;You spent: &lt;span&gt; { timer }&lt;/span&gt; seconds&lt;/div&gt;

So if you declare it in your root component like this:
import './App.css';
import { useEffect, useState} from &quot;react&quot;;


function App() {
    const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
            setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        }, 1000);
        return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
    }, []);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const script = document.createElement('script')
        script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
        script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
        script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {
            const config = {
                trackBy: 'seconds',
            };

            if (TimeOnSiteTracker) {
                var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
                window.Tos = Tos;
            }

        })
        document.body.appendChild(script)
    }, [])
    
    return (
        &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
            &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    You spent : &lt;span&gt;{timer} &lt;/span&gt; Seconds
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}


You can get a timer. Then it is a matter of playing in how you access the state in all your pages and properly configuring Tos to be tracked in all the pages you want.
","  Great, let's dive into your questions!
1. Fetching third-party objects in React:
Yes, you can fetch third-party objects like the `Tos` object in your case directly in the React root index.html file. However, it's good practice to keep this kind of code in a separate file, especially if you're planning to use the `Tos` object in multiple components. This way, you can keep the code organized and maintainable.
So, instead of accessing `Tos` directly in the root index.html file, you can create a separate file (e.g., `time-tracker.js`) and export the `Tos` object. Then, in your React components, you can import the `Tos` object and use it.
2. Including the HTML block:
Yes, you are correct in including the HTML block directly in the React root index.html file. This is a common practice, especially when you're working with third-party libraries that don't provide a React component for their API.
In your case, since you're using the `timeonsite.js` library, it's fine to include the HTML block directly in the root index.html file.
3. Using `setInterval()`:
Yes, you can use `setInterval()` to update the living timer in React. This is a common approach, especially when you want to update the timer frequently (e.g., every second).
However, note that using `setInterval()` can be expensive, especially if you're updating the timer frequently. It's better to use a more efficient approach like using a React hook or a component lifecycle method to update the timer.
Here's an example of how you can update the timer using a React hook:
```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
function Clock() {
  const [timeOnPage, setTimeOnPage] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleTOS = (data) => {
      setTimeOnPage(data.timeOnPage);
    };

    Tos.addEventListener('track', handleTOS);

    return () => {
      Tos.removeEventListener('track', handleTOS);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div id=""time-container"">

      {timeOnPage} seconds

    </div>
  );
```
In this example, we're using the `useState` hook to store the current time on page in the `timeOnPage` state variable. We're also using the `useEffect` hook to handle the `TOS` event and update the `timeOnPage` state variable when the event is triggered.
You can then use the `timeOnPage` state variable to render the living timer in your app.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",0.6471275091171265,"javascript, reactjs, time-tracking",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Using some kind of webpack plugin for your cdn. But this will present the same issue as the previous approach. It just looks cleaner.
Add onMount the script:

function App() {
  // Proof that we can use Tos object
  const click = () =&gt; {
    console.log('Click', Tos)
    Tos
  }
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // This is the same that your script does but in a &quot;React&quot; way
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
    script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
    script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {

        const config = {
          trackBy: 'seconds',
          developerMode: true,
          callback: function(data) {
            console.log(data);

          }
        };
        if(TimeOnSiteTracker) {
         // IF this was not a `var` it will not be a global scoped variable
          var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
          window.Tos = Tos;
        }

    })
    document.body.appendChild(script)
  }, [])
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={click}&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

Using useEffect we can basically mount the 3rd-party library on the mount lifecycle. In this last approach, you have more control over the parameters that you pass to the library, they can even be more dynamic and easier to interact as you will see in the answer to your 3rd question.

Is it proper way to include the HTML block,
or the right way would be write it as React component?

To get the power of react (rendering, performance control over components) the best thing will be to move this code into the JSX of your app. This way this element will be dynamically added and not hard coded as in your approach.

I added the powerful setInterval(function() {}, 1000); JS Interval function. Is it fine or
we can use React inbuilt timer function for updating TIMER &quot;div&quot; each
second?

Actually given the API of Timeonsite.js, there is no better way of doing this (some may think that callback argument is called every time there is an update, but no, only on start and onload. Also, if we check what the developermode does, it basically calls Tos every second using the interval:
if (this.developerMode) {
        setInterval(function() {
            self.showProgress();
        }, (1 * 1000));
    }

To do this in a React friendly way:
 const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
        console.log(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
    }, 1000);
    return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

And then in the JSX:
 &lt;div&gt;You spent: &lt;span&gt; { timer }&lt;/span&gt; seconds&lt;/div&gt;

So if you declare it in your root component like this:
import './App.css';
import { useEffect, useState} from &quot;react&quot;;


function App() {
    const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
            setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        }, 1000);
        return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
    }, []);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const script = document.createElement('script')
        script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
        script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
        script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {
            const config = {
                trackBy: 'seconds',
            };

            if (TimeOnSiteTracker) {
                var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
                window.Tos = Tos;
            }

        })
        document.body.appendChild(script)
    }, [])
    
    return (
        &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
            &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    You spent : &lt;span&gt;{timer} &lt;/span&gt; Seconds
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}


You can get a timer. Then it is a matter of playing in how you access the state in all your pages and properly configuring Tos to be tracked in all the pages you want.
","To integrate the `timeonsite.js` library into a basic ReactJS app and display a live time counter for tracking user engagement, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the `timeonsite.js` library to your React app by including the script tag in the `public/index.html` file. You've already done this correctly.

2. To access the `Tos` object in your React app, you can use `window.Tos` as you have done in the provided code. This is the correct approach to access a third-party object in React.

3. Instead of directly adding the HTML block `<span id=""timeonsite"" style=""color:#f55;""></span> Seconds` in the `index.html` file, it is recommended to create a React component for it. This allows better control and flexibility over rendering and updating the component. Here's an example of how you can create a React component for the time counter:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const TimeCounter = () => {
  const [timeOnSite, setTimeOnSite] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setTimeOnSite(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid #bbb', borderRadius: '10px', textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'cursive' }}>
      You spent: <span style={{ color: '#f55' }}>{timeOnSite}</span> Seconds
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimeCounter;
```

4. In your main component or any other component where you want to display the time counter, you can import and use the `TimeCounter` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import TimeCounter from './TimeCounter';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your other app content */}
      <TimeCounter />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

By following these steps, you will have a React component `TimeCounter` that uses the `timeonsite.js` library to display the live time counter for tracking user engagement. The component will update every second using the `setInterval` function.",0.6318907737731934,"javascript, reactjs, time-tracking",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Yes, there is a specific R command that you can use to obtain the standard deviation of the differences between each comparison after performing a Tukey HSD test. You can use the `t.stats()` function from the `stats` package to calculate the means and standard deviations of the differences between each combination of means.
Here is an example code that you can use:
```R
#Extract the means and standard deviations of the differences between each comparison
means_diff&lt;-t.stats(model,main=""Means of differences"",diff=T)$mean
sds_diff&lt;-t.stats(model,main=""Standard deviations of differences"",diff=T)$sd
```
This code will extract the means and standard deviations of the differences between each comparison using the `t.stats()` function. In this case, `means_diff` will contain the means of the differences between each comparison, while `sds_diff` will contain the standard deviations of those differences.
Note that the `t.stats()` function also outputs the p-values of the differences, but you may not need these if you have already performed the Tukey HSD test.
Alternatively, you can also use other packages such as `hclust` and `kmeans` to perform the clustering analysis.
```R
#Cluster the data into K groups using k-means
kmeans&lt;-kmeans(data,centers=K)
#Extract the means and standard deviations of the differences between each group
means_diff_kmeans&lt;-with(kmeans,mean(diff(height)))
sds_diff_kmeans&lt;-with(kmeans,sd(diff(height)))
```
This code will cluster the data into K groups using the k-means algorithm and then extract the means and standard deviations of the differences between each group using the `with()` function.

","  Sure, I can help you with that! Yes, it is definitely possible to display the name of a line chart in E Charts.
You can use the `label` option in the `series` configuration to display a text label for each line. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to display the name of each line:
```
import { Line } from 'echarts';
let chartData = [
  {
    name: 'Line 1',
    value: 10,
    label: 'Line 1'
  },
  {

    value: 20,
    label: 'Line 2'
  },
  {
    name: 'Line 3',
    value: 30,
    label: 'Line 3'
  }
];

let chartOption = {
  title: {
    text: 'Line Chart with Name'
  },
  tooltip: {
    trigger: 'item'
  },
  legend: {
    data: ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']
  },
  xAxis: {
    boundaryGap: [0, 0.01]
  },
  yAxis: {
    label: {
      distance: 10
    }
  },
  series: [
    {
      name: 'Line 1',
      value: 10,
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'end'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'Line 2',
      value: 20,
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'end'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'Line 3',
      value: 30,
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'end'
      }
    }
  ]
};

let myChart = new Line(chartOption);

myChart.on('chartInit', () => {
  console.log('Chart initialized');
});


```
In this example, we've added a `label` property to each series object in the `series` configuration, and set its value to the name of each line. We've also set the `show` property to `true` to display the labels. The `position` property is set to `'end'` to display the labels at the end of each line.
You can customize the `label` option further by changing the `position` property to `'inside'`, which will display the label inside the line, or `'outside'`, which will display the label outside the line.

","To display the line name at the end of each line in an Echarts Line chart, you can use the `label` option provided by Echarts.

Here is an example of how you can achieve this:

1. First, make sure you have imported the necessary Echarts libraries and components in your project.

2. In your Line chart configuration, add a `series` object for each line you want to display. Inside each `series` object, add a `label` object to customize the label appearance.

```javascript
option = {
  // ... other chart configuration options

  series: [
    {
      name: 'Line 1',
      type: 'line',
      data: [/* your data points */],
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'end', // Display the label at the end of the line
        formatter: '{b}', // Use the name of the series as the label content
        color: '#000', // Customize the label color
        // You can add more styling options here if needed
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Line 2',
      type: 'line',
      data: [/* your data points */],
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'end',
        formatter: '{b}',
        color: '#000',
      },
    },
    // ... add more series objects for other lines
  ],
};
```

In the above example, the `label` object is added inside each `series` object. The `position` property is set to `'end'` to display the label at the end of the line. The `formatter` property uses `{b}` placeholder to display the name of the series as the label content. You can customize the `color` and other styling options according to your preference.

By adding the `label` object to each series, the Line chart will display the line name at the end of each line.

Note: This solution assumes you are using Echarts version 4.x or later. The `label` option might have different properties or behavior in older versions of Echarts.",0.7555767297744751,"javascript, reactjs, echarts, apache-echarts",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The issue with the trigger you provided is that it is not correctly calculating the value to be inserted into the `hourOt` column in the `emp_proj_overtime` table.
The `IF` statement is correctly checking if the `hoursWorked` value is greater than 100, but it is not subtracting the correct value from `hoursWorked`. Instead of subtracting 100, it is subtracting the value of `hoursWorked` itself, which results in an incorrect calculation.
To fix this issue, you can modify the `SELECT` clause of the `IF` statement to use the `hoursWorked - 100` expression, like this:
```
BEGIN
        IF(hoursWorked > 100) 
        THEN
        INSERT INTO emp_proj_overtime(empNo, projNo, hourOt)
        SELECT empNo, projNo, hoursWorked - 100 
        FROM EMP_PROJ;
        END IF;
END;
```
This should correctly insert the hours into the `emp_proj_overtime` table with the correct value.
Another thing to note is that you are using `SELECT` statement inside the `IF` statement, which is not necessary, and it can make the code harder to read and maintain.
You can remove the `SELECT` statement inside the `IF` statement and use the `INSERT` statement directly, like this:
```
BEGIN
        IF(hoursWorked > 100) 
        THEN
        INSERT INTO emp_proj_overtime(empNo, projNo, hourOt)
        values (SELECT empNo, projNo, hoursWorked - 100 
        FROM EMP_PROJ);
        END IF;
END;

","The issue with your trigger is that you are not correctly referencing the updated value of the `hoursWorked` column in the `IF` statement. In your current implementation, the `hoursWorked` variable is declared but not assigned any value, so it will always be null or 0.

To fix this problem, you need to use the `:NEW` keyword to access the updated value of the `hoursWorked` column in the trigger. Here's the updated trigger code:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER OVERTIME_HOURS
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF hoursWorked ON EMP_PROJ
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    hoursOver100 NUMBER(22);
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.hoursWorked > 100 THEN
        hoursOver100 := :NEW.hoursWorked - 100;
        
        INSERT INTO emp_proj_overtime(empNo, projNo, hourOt)
        VALUES (:NEW.empNo, :NEW.projNo, hoursOver100);
    END IF;
END;
/
```

In this updated trigger:

1. The `FOR EACH ROW` clause is added to specify that the trigger should be fired for each row affected by the insert or update operation.
2. The `:NEW.hoursWorked` expression is used to access the updated value of the `hoursWorked` column for the current row being processed.
3. The `hoursOver100` variable is assigned the value of `:NEW.hoursWorked - 100`.
4. The `INSERT` statement is modified to use the `VALUES` clause instead of the `SELECT` statement, as we are only inserting a single row into `emp_proj_overtime`.

With these changes, the trigger will correctly insert the overtime hours into the `emp_proj_overtime` table whenever the `hoursWorked` value exceeds 100.",0.7023621201515198,"sql, oracle, if-statement, triggers",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","The type &amp;mut T which is a reference doesn't implement Copy thus the reference moved in the first loop and you can't access it anymore. To get around this you have to reborrow with this:
for nurse in &amp;mut *nurse_list {…}

in every loop you do not want the nurse_list to move into.
","  The error message you're seeing is caused by the fact that you're trying to borrow a value that has been moved. In Rust, when you move a value, it ceases to exist as a source of borrowing, and any references to it are no longer valid.
In your case, the `nurse_list` variable is being moved inside the `for` loop, and then you're trying to borrow it again in the next line. However, since the value has been moved, the borrow checker is warning you that you can't borrow a moved value.
To fix this issue, you need to remove the borrowing of `nurse_list` altogether and instead use the `iter()` method on the mutably borrowed `Vec` to iterate over its elements. Here's an updated version of your function that should work:
```rust
fn assign_nurses_to_schedule(
        nurse_list: &mut Vec<Nurse>,
        fte_budget: &Vec<NursesNeeded>,
        cyclical_rosters: &Vec<Roster>,
        total_incumbent_score: &mut i32,
) -> Vec<Assignment> {
    let mut assignments: Vec<Assignment> = vec![];
    let mut incumbent_score = 1000;
    //let mut total_incumbent_score = 0;
    let mut new_score: i32;
    for roster in cyclical_rosters {
        let mut taken_nurse: Option<i32> = None;
        for nurse in nurse_list {
            new_score = calculate_score(&roster, nurse.get_pref_score().to_vec());
            if incumbent_score < new_score {
                incumbent_score = new_score;
                assignments.push(new_assignment(roster.get_nr(), nurse.get_nr()));
                taken_nurse = Some(nurse.get_nr());
            }
        }
        // add preference penalty to total score
        *total_incumbent_score += incumbent_score;
        // remove the nurse from the list, already assigned to a schedule
        nurse_list.retain(|nurse| !taken_nurse.contains(nurse.get_nr()));
    }
    assignments
}
```
By using the `iter()` method on the mutably borrowed `Vec`, you can iterate over its elements without having to move the `nurse_list` variable. The `iter()` method will also return an iterator over the elements of the `Vec`, which you can use to iterate over the nurses in the list.
Additionally, I changed the signature of the function to return `Vec<Assignment>` instead of `Vec<NurseAssignment>` to reflect that the function is returning a vector of `Assignment`s, not `NurseAssignment`s.

     = note: borrow occurs due to deref coercion to `[definitions::Nurse]`

I tried borrowing the nurse_list again in the for loop for nurse in &amp;nurse_list { ... } which then returns the following error:
src\main.rs:64:22

   |
   = help: the trait `Iterator` is not implemented for `&amp;&amp;mut Vec&lt;definitions::Nurse&gt;`

","The type &amp;mut T which is a reference doesn't implement Copy thus the reference moved in the first loop and you can't access it anymore. To get around this you have to reborrow with this:
for nurse in &amp;mut *nurse_list {…}

in every loop you do not want the nurse_list to move into.
","The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to borrow the `nurse_list` multiple times within the nested loops. The issue arises because the outer loop already borrows `nurse_list` mutably, and then the inner loop tries to borrow it again. This violates Rust's borrowing rules.

To fix this problem, you can use the `iter_mut()` method on `nurse_list` to iterate over the nurses mutably. This way, you won't run into the issue of borrowing the same value multiple times. Here's the modified code:

```rust
fn assign_nurses_to_schedule(
    nurse_list: &mut Vec<Nurse>,
    fte_budget: &Vec<NursesNeeded>,
    cyclical_rosters: &Vec<Roster>,
    total_incumbent_score: &mut i32,
) -> Vec<Assignment> {
    let mut assignments: Vec<Assignment> = vec![];
    let mut incumbent_score = 1000;
    let mut new_score: i32;

    for schedule in cyclical_rosters {
        let mut taken_nurse: Option<i32> = None;
        for nurse in nurse_list.iter_mut() {
            new_score = calculate_score(&schedule, nurse.get_pref_score().to_vec());
            if incumbent_score < new_score {
                incumbent_score = new_score;
                assignments.push(new_assignment(schedule.get_nr(), nurse.get_nr()));
                taken_nurse = Some(nurse.get_nr());
            }
        }

        *total_incumbent_score += incumbent_score;

        if let Some(taken_nurse_nr) = taken_nurse {
            // Remove the nurse from the list, already assigned to a schedule
            let index = nurse_list.iter().position(|nurse| nurse.get_nr() == taken_nurse_nr);
            if let Some(index) = index {
                nurse_list.remove(index);
            }
        }

        // TODO: Stop assigning nurses to schedules when fte budget is reached
        // Do the schedules adhere to the fte budget?
    }

    assignments
}
```

In the modified code, I replaced the `for nurse in nurse_list` loop with `for nurse in nurse_list.iter_mut()`, which allows us to iterate over the nurses mutably without borrowing `nurse_list` again. I also added an `if let` check to ensure that we only remove the nurse from the list if `taken_nurse` has a value.

With these changes, the code should compile without any borrow checker errors.",0.6038661003112793,"rust, iterator, borrow-checker",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  You are correct that when you use the `Union` method to join multiple ranges, you only get the row dimensions of the resulting range. To get the column dimensions as well, you can use the `Union` method with the `Preserve` argument set to `True`. This will preserve the columns of the original ranges when combining them into a new range.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to get the desired result:
```
Sub arrTest()
    
    'Declare varbs
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim myArr() As Variant
    Dim lRow As Integer
    Dim myRng As Range
    
    'Assign varbs
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)
    
    With ws
        
        lRow = .Cells(Rows.count, &quot;C&quot;).End(xlUp).row
       Set myRng = Application.Union(.Range(&quot;G3:G&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;J3:O&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;AD3:AE&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;AI3:AI&quot; &amp; lRow), Preserve:=True)
         myArr = myRng.Value2
         
    End With

Will return a variant of
myArr(1, 1)
myArr(2, 1)
myArr(1, 3)
Now, you can get the column dimensions of the resulting array by using the `Dimensions` property of the array. For example:
```

Sub arrTest()


    'Declare varbs
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim myArr() As Variant
    Dim lRow As Integer
    Dim myRng As Range
    
    'Assign varbs
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)
    
    With ws

        lRow = .Cells(Rows.count, &quot;C&quot;).End(xlUp).row
       Set myRng = Application.Union(.Range(&quot;G3:G&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;J3:O&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;AD3:AE&quot; &amp; lRow), .Range(&quot;AI3:AI&quot; &amp; lRow), Preserve:=True)

        Dim dimCol As Integer
        dimCol = UBound(myArr, 1) - 1

        Debug.Print & quot;Column dimensions: & quot; & dimCol & quot;



    End With


```
This will print the column dimensions of the resulting array, which in this case are 4.
Note that the `Preserve` argument is only necessary when you're using the `Union` method to combine ranges that have different numbers of columns. If the ranges have the same number of columns, you don't need to use `Preserve` because the column dimensions will be preserved automatically.",0.7618662118911743,"excel, vba, multidimensional-array",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    Dim lRow As Integer
    Dim lCol As Integer
    Dim myRng As Range
    
    'Assign variables

```

In this modified code, we introduce the `lCol` variable to determine the last column in the sheet. We use `Cells(1, .Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column` to find the last column with data in the first row. After that, we use `ReDim` to resize the `myArr` array to match the dimensions of the `myRng` range. Finally, we assign the values of the range to the array using `myArr = myRng.Value2`.

","  No problem! You can add a separator character after every three numbers in an input field using JavaScript. Here's how:
1. First, you need to add a button or a Press function that triggers the separator character to be added. You can use the ""onkeydown"" event to detect when the user presses a key in the input field.
```
<input type=""text"" id=""myInput"" onkeydown=""separateNumbers()"">

```



```
function separateNumbers() {
  var inputValue = document.getElementById(""myInput"").value;
  // Split the input value into an array of numbers
  var numbers = inputValue.split("""");
  // Add a separator (-) after every three numbers
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 3) {
    // Add the separator
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      numbers[i] = numbers[i] + ""-"";
    }
  }
  // Set the input value to the new array of numbers
  document.getElementById(""myInput"").value = numbers;
}
```


2. Next, you need to write the logic to split the input value into an array of numbers. You can use the ""split()"" method to do this.
```
var numbers = inputValue.split("""");

```

3. Once you have the array of numbers, you can add the separator character after every three numbers using a for loop. You can use the modulo operator (%) to check if the current index is divisible by 3. If it is, you can add the separator character to the array.
```
if (i % 3 === 0) {
  numbers[i] = numbers[i] + ""-"";
}

```

4. Finally, you need to set the input value back to the new array of numbers using the ""value"" property.
```
document.getElementById(""myInput"").value = numbers;

```

Here's the complete code:
```
<input type=""text"" id=""myInput"" onkeydown=""separateNumbers()"">




```



function separateNumbers() {
  var inputValue = document.getElementById(""myInput"").value;
  // Split the input value into an array of numbers
  var numbers = inputValue.split("""");
  // Add a separator (-) after every three numbers
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 3) {
    // Add the separator
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      numbers[i] = numbers[i] + ""-"";
    }
  }
  // Set the input value to the new array of numbers
  document.getElementById(""myInput"").value = numbers;
}

","To add a separator character between each three numbers in an input field, you can use JavaScript to listen for changes in the input field and update the value accordingly. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. First, you need to select the input field using its ID or any other suitable selector. Let's assume the input field has an ID of ""myInput"".

```javascript
const inputField = document.getElementById('myInput');
```

2. Next, you can attach an event listener to the input field to listen for changes in its value.

```javascript
inputField.addEventListener('input', formatInput);
```

3. Inside the event listener function `formatInput`, you can retrieve the current value of the input field and remove any existing separator characters (e.g., hyphens) using the `replace` method.

```javascript
function formatInput() {
  let inputValue = inputField.value.replace(/-/g, '');
}
```

4. After removing the existing separators, you can add the desired separator character (hyphen) after every three characters using the `replace` method again. Here, we use the regular expression `/(\d{3})/g` to match every three digits and add a hyphen after them.

```javascript
function formatInput() {
  let inputValue = inputField.value.replace(/-/g, '');
  inputValue = inputValue.replace(/(\d{3})/g, '$1-');
}
```

5. Finally, you can update the value of the input field with the formatted value.

```javascript
function formatInput() {
  let inputValue = inputField.value.replace(/-/g, '');
  inputValue = inputValue.replace(/(\d{3})/g, '$1-');
  inputField.value = inputValue;
}
```

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! To compare two symbols with almost 100% inverse correlation and identify the bars when both tickers closed positive or negative, you can use the `cross` function in PineScript. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:
First, let's consider the two symbols you want to compare. Let's call them `ticker1` and `ticker2`. You can use the `ticker1.close` and `ticker2.close` functions to get the closing prices of these symbols for each bar in the chart.
Next, you can use the `cross` function to compare the prices of these symbols and identify the bars when they are both positive or negative. Here's the code:
```
//@title Comparison of two symbols with almost 100% inverse correlation
// Inputs
length1 = input(14)
length2 = input(14)
ticker1 = ""Symbol1""
ticker2 = ""Symbol2""

// Define the cross function
cross = ta.cross(ticker1.close, ticker2.close)

// Plot the cross function
plot(cross, color.green, 9)

// Identify the bars when both symbols are positive or negative
positive_bars = ta.find(cross > 0, len = length)
negative_bars = ta.find(cross < 0, len = length)

// Plot the positive and negative bars
plot(positive_bars, color.red, 9)
plot(negative_bars, color.blue, 9)
```
In this code, the `length1` and `length2` variables are used to set the length of the input signals for each symbol. The `ticker1` and `ticker2` variables are used to specify the symbols to compare. The `cross` function is then used to calculate the difference between the closing prices of these symbols over each bar.
The `ta.find` function is then used to identify the bars when both symbols are positive (i.e., `cross > 0`) or negative (i.e., `cross < 0`). Finally, the `plot` function is used to plot these bars with different colors.
Note that the `ta.find` function takes two arguments: the first is a function that checks whether the cross value is greater than or equal to 0 (for positive bars) or less than or equal to 0 (for negative bars), and the second is the length of the input signal to check.",0.5393322706222534,pine-script,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To fix the problem of comparing two symbols with almost 100% inverse correlation to identify the bars where both tickers closed positive or negative, you can follow these steps using pine-script:

1. Define the two symbols you want to compare using the `syminfo.tickerid` function. For example, if you want to compare symbol1 and symbol2, you can add the following lines at the beginning of your script:
```
symbol1 = syminfo.tickerid + ""1""
symbol2 = syminfo.tickerid + ""2""
```
Note: Adding ""1"" and ""2"" to the tickerid will create two separate symbols for comparison.

2. Create two separate variables to store the closing prices of both symbols using the `close` function. For example:
```
close1 = close(symbol1)
close2 = close(symbol2)
```

3. Calculate the correlation between the two closing price series using the `correlation` function. This function takes two arguments, the first being the first data series, and the second being the second data series. For example:
```
correlation_value = correlation(close1, close2)
```

4. Define a threshold value to determine when the correlation breaks down and the tickers lose their inverse correlation. For example, if you want to consider a breakdown when the correlation value falls below -0.9, you can set the threshold as:
```
threshold = -0.9
```

5. Use conditional statements to identify the bars where both tickers closed positive or negative. You can use the `close > open` condition to check if the closing price is higher than the opening price. For example:
```
both_positive = close1 > open and close2 > open
both_negative = close1 < open and close2 < open
```

6. Finally, plot the bars where both tickers closed positive or negative using the `plotshape` function. For example:
```
plotshape(both_positive, title=""Both Positive"", location=location.belowbar, color=color.green, style=shape.labelup)
plotshape(both_negative, title=""Both Negative"", location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, style=shape.labeldown)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to compare two symbols with almost 100% inverse correlation and identify the bars where both tickers closed positive or negative. Adjust the threshold value and any other conditions as per your specific requirements.",0.5765225291252136,pine-script,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","One issue I see is that your thread is re-mapping only stdout to the new console, but it is not re-mapping stdin as well.  So it is quite likely (use a debugger to verify this) that std::cin.get() is failing and thus not blocking the thread from closing the console immediately after creating it.
","  Thank you for providing the code. From what you've shared, it seems that you're trying to load a DLL into a process and creating a thread within the DLL to display a console. However, there are a few issues in your code that might be preventing the console from appearing:
1. Incorrect function signature: In the `DllMain` function, the `ul_reason_for_call` parameter is of type DWORD, but the function signature expects a parameter of type DLL_REASON. Make sure to use the correct parameter type.
2. Missing `CreateProcess` call: In the `DllMain` function, you're creating a thread using the `CreateThread` function, but you're not creating a process context to execute the thread in. You need to call `CreateProcess` to create a new process context before calling `CreateThread`.
3. Incorrect thread creation: In the `DllMain` function, you're creating a thread using the `CreateThread` function, but the thread you're creating is not the proper type. The `CreateThread` function takes a parameter of type LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE, which is a function pointer that points to the thread entry point. In your case, you're passing the address of the `HackThread` function as the parameter, but `HackThread` is not a thread entry point. Instead, you need to pass the address of the `main` function as the parameter.
4. Console initialization issue: In the `HackThread` function, you're calling `AllocConsole` and `FreeConsole` to create and dispose of the console, but you're not properly initializing the console. You need to call `SetConsoleActiveMode(TRUE)` to activate the console before it will be visible.
Here's an updated version of your code that addresses these issues:

","Based on the code provided, it seems that the issue lies in the way the console is being allocated and redirected in the DLL. The `AllocConsole()` function is used to create a new console for the process, and `freopen_s()` is used to redirect `stdout` to the console.

One possible reason why the console is not showing up could be related to the timing of the console allocation and redirection. It is possible that the console is being created and redirected, but the main thread of the process (where the console would be displayed) has already finished execution before the DLL has a chance to allocate and redirect the console.

To fix this issue, you can try adding a delay or waiting for a specific event before creating the console and redirecting `stdout`. One approach could be to create a named event in the main process and wait for the DLL to signal that event before creating the console. This ensures that the console is created and redirected before the main thread finishes execution.

Here's an updated version of the DLL code that includes the event synchronization:

```cpp
#include ""pch.h""
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
#include <TlHelp32.h>

DWORD WINAPI HackThread(HMODULE hModule)
{
    // Wait for the event to be signaled before creating the console
    HANDLE hEvent = OpenEvent(EVENT_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, ""MyEvent"");
    WaitForSingleObject(hEvent, INFINITE);
    CloseHandle(hEvent);

    // Create Console
    AllocConsole();
    FILE* f;
    freopen_s(&f, ""CONOUT$"", ""w"", stdout);

    std::cout << ""ttt"" << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
    fclose(f);
    FreeConsole();
    FreeLibraryAndExitThread(hModule, 0);
    return 0;
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule,
    DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
    LPVOID lpReserved
)
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        // Create the event and signal it to allow console creation
        HANDLE hEvent = CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE, FALSE, ""MyEvent"");
        SetEvent(hEvent);
        CloseHandle(hEvent);

        CreateThread(nullptr, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)HackThread, hModule, 0, nullptr);
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

In the main process, before loading the DLL, you can add a delay or wait for a specific event to ensure that the DLL has enough time to create and redirect the console. For example:

```cpp
// ...
// Create a Remote Thread in the target process which
// calls LoadLibraryA as our dllpath as an argument -> program loads our dll
HANDLE hLoadThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, 0, 0,
    (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(""Kernel32.dll""),
        ""LoadLibraryA""), pDllPath, 0, 0);

// Wait for a specific event or add a delay here before continuing
// ...

// Wait for the execution of our loader thread to finish
WaitForSingleObject(hLoadThread, INFINITE);
// ...
```

By synchronizing the creation of the console with an event or delay, you should be able to ensure that the console is properly allocated and redirected before the main thread finishes execution, allowing it to show up as expected.",0.6029776334762573,"c++, dll",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

And this box was checked by default.
","  It sounds like you are experiencing a common issue in Git where branches are not being correctly synced between multiple machines. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:
1. Check the remote branches: On both home and office computers, run the following command to list all the remote branches:
```
$ git remote -v
```
This should list all the remote branches that are set up on both machines. Check if the `someBranch` branch is present on both machines and if it has the correct URL.
2. Fetch remotely: Make sure that you are fetching the remote branches correctly using the following command:
```
$ git fetch origin
```
This command will update the local repository with the latest data from the remote repository. If you are still unable to see the `someBranch` branch, try running the following command:
```
$ git fetch origin -a
```
This will fetch all the remote branches and tag names.
3. Check the SSH keys: Ensure that your SSH keys are properly set up on both machines and that they are the same. You can check the SSH keys by running the following command on each machine:

$ git config --list

This will list all the configuration options for your Git repository. Look for the `SSH` section to confirm that the correct SSH key is set up on each machine.
4. Reset HTTPS: If you are using HTTPS, try resetting the remote repository by running the following command:


$ git remote update origin


This will update the remote repository with the latest data from the HTTPS repository.
5. Test the branch: Once you have resolved the above issues, try checking out the `someBranch` branch on both machines and see if it is visible. You can do this by running the following commands:
Home machine:


$ git checkout someBranch

Office machine:


$ git checkout someBranch

If the branch is not present on one of the machines, you may need to manually copy the SSH key or use a different method to sync the branches.
6. Use a branching and merging strategy: If you are experiencing issues with multiple machines not being able to find each other's branches, consider using a branching and merging strategy. You can use a tool like `git-flow` to simplify your workflow and ensure that all machines are tracking the same branches.

","The issue you are experiencing, where the branches from GitLab cannot be found on both your home and office computers, can be resolved by following a few steps:

1. Check the remote URL: Ensure that the remote URL for your GitLab repository is correctly set on both computers. You can verify this by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

   This will display the remote URL for your repository. Make sure it matches the GitLab repository URL.

2. Pull latest changes: Before trying to fetch a specific branch, make sure you have the latest changes from the remote repository. Run the following command to fetch all branches and updates from the remote repository:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

   This will update your local repository with the latest changes from GitLab.

3. Check branch visibility: Ensure that the branch you are trying to fetch is visible on GitLab. Log in to your GitLab account and navigate to your repository. Go to the ""Branches"" section and check if the branch ""someBranch"" is listed and accessible.

4. Verify SSH key setup: Since you mentioned that you are using different SSH keys on your home and office computers, it's crucial to ensure that the SSH keys are correctly configured on both machines. Copying the SSH key from one computer to another can help, but it's important to verify that the keys are correctly associated with your GitLab account.

   - On each computer, run the following command to check if the SSH key is correctly configured:

     ```
     ssh -T git@gitlab.com
     ```

     This will test the SSH connection to GitLab. If it prompts you to verify the authenticity of the host, type ""yes"" and press Enter.

     If the connection is successful, it means the SSH key is correctly configured. If not, you may need to generate a new SSH key and add it to your GitLab account.

   - Verify that the correct SSH key is associated with your GitLab account. Log in to GitLab and navigate to ""User Settings"" > ""SSH Keys"". Ensure that the SSH key on each computer is added to your GitLab account.

   - If the SSH key is not properly associated, you can add it manually by copying the public key (usually located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to your GitLab account.

5. Update GitLab repository URL: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you can try updating the remote URL for your GitLab repository on both computers. Run the following command to update the URL:

   ```
   git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:username/repository.git
   ```

","  The issue in your code is that you are not providing a way for the program to exit the loop when the user presses Enter. The `while` loop will continue to run until the user enters another character, so when the user presses Enter, the program does not know when to stop.
To solve this problem, you can use the `getche()` function, which reads a character from the standard input and returns it as a character without advancing the input pointer. Here's an updated version of your code:
```
int main()
{
    char c;
    int nums=0,chars=0;
    while(cin>>c){
        if(c&gt;='0'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='9'){
            nums++;
        }else if((c&gt;='A'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='Z')||(c&gt;='a'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='z')){
            chars++;
        }

        // Add this line to exit the loop when Enter is pressed
        if(c == '\n'){
            break; // exit the loop
            }

    }
    printf(&quot;nums:%d\nchars:%d&quot;,nums,chars);
    return 0;
}
```
In the updated code, we added a `if` statement that checks if the character read is `\n`, which is the ASCII code for a line feed. If the character is `\n`, the program will exit the loop using the `break` statement.
Another way to exit the loop is to use `cin.ignore()` function, which ignores the next whitespace character from the input stream. Here's an example:
```

int main()
{

    char c;
    int nums=0,chars=0;
    while(cin>>c){
        if(c&gt;='0'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='9'){
            nums++;
        }else if((c&gt;='A'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='Z')||(c&gt;='a'&amp;&amp;c&lt;='z')){
            chars++;
        }

        cin.ignore(1024,'\n'); // ignore next 1024 characters

    }
    printf(&quot;nums:%d\nchars:%d&quot;,nums,chars);
    return 0;
}
```
In this updated code, we added the `cin.ignore()` function after the `while` statement, which ignores the next 1024 characters from the input stream. This will allow the program to ignore the Enter character that is pressed to exit the loop.
Both of these solutions will work, but the second one is more elegant and efficient, since it doesn't require an `if` statement to check for the exact character.",0.6710994839668274,"c++, while-loop, cin",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Looks like you are trying to do a backendless inside the backendless.
","  Thank you for reaching out for assistance! It's great to hear that you're using Backendless for your backend development and interested in leveraging its capabilities to manage user authentication across multiple websites.
To answer your question, the short answer is yes, you can create additional user tables in Backendless and associate them with different websites. This can be achieved by following these steps:
1. Create a new user table:
In your Backendless account, go to the ""Databases"" section and click on the ""User Tables"" tab. Click the ""Create Table"" button to create a new user table. Give your table a unique name, and set the ""Website"" field to the name of the website that you want to associate with this table.
2. Associate the new table with the website:
After creating the new user table, you need to associate it with the website. To do this, go to the ""Website Settings"" section and click on the ""User Tables"" tab. Here, you can select the user table you created, and associate it with the website.
3. Add a new column to the user table:
If you want to categorize the users based on the website, you can add a new column to the user table with the website name. For example, you can add a new column called ""Website"" and set its type to ""Text"". This will allow you to store the website name for each user in this column.
4. Update the user records:
Finally, you need to update the user records in the new table with the website name. You can do this by looping through the user records in the table and updating the ""Website"" column with the name of the website associated with each user.

By following these steps, you can create and associate additional user tables with different websites in Backendless. This will allow you to manage user authentication and authorization for each website separately, while still using Backendless as the backend for your applications.
In summary, you can create multiple user tables in Backendless and associate them with different websites. You can also add a new column to the user table to categorize the users based on the website. This will enable you to manage user authentication and authorization for each website separately while using Backendless as the backend for your applications.

Looks like you are trying to do a backendless inside the backendless.
","To share the User Table between different websites for authorization in Backendless, you have a few options:

1. Multiple Backendless Apps: Each website can have its own Backendless App with its own User Table. This approach ensures separation between websites but requires multiple Apps and accounts.

2. Custom User Properties: You can add a new column to the Backendless 'Users' table to categorize users by website/app. For example, you can add a column called 'website' and set it to the respective website name for each user. Then, when authorizing users, you can check this column to determine which website they belong to.

Here are the steps to implement this approach:

- In your Backendless Console, go to the Data section and select the 'Users' table.
- Click on the 'Schema' tab and add a new column called 'website' (or any other name you prefer).
- Update the 'website' column for each user, specifying the respective website/app they belong to.
- In your website's code, when authorizing users, retrieve the 'website' value for the user and use it to determine the appropriate authorization logic.

This approach allows you to use a single Backendless App and account while categorizing users by website/app. However, it requires custom logic in your code to handle the authorization process based on the 'website' column.

These options should help you achieve the desired user authorization across multiple websites using Backendless. Choose the one that best suits your requirements and implementation preferences.",0.6831681132316589,backendless,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

The goal is to populate the Components column from the master sheet (SheetA) with the information from secondary sheets (SheetX). Considering the following rules:

The content of Components for a given Id value will the be the value of Component from any secondary sheet, where RefId column value is the same. If there is more than value, then it concatenates all the component information delimited by comma (,).
If the Components value in the master sheet is not empty, then the content of the search by Id will be appended delimited by comma (,).
The sheet names can be provided as a list or just refer in the formula to each sheet name.

Currently I'm using the above mentioned VLOOKUP formulas, but they break when a sheet has multiple entries for a given Id.
","Let's try with Power Query(PQ), your question is related to typical ETL operations and PQ is more suitable than using excel functions.
To easy differentiate the sheets, I am going to consider the Master Sheet, where we want the information consolidated and the secondary sheets, which are the input sheets to consolidate the information in the Master.
Since all the secondary sheets (SheetA, SheetB...) have the same structure, we can merge them.
This is the PQ command to generate AllSheets query as output:
=Table.Combine({TB_ShA, TB_ShB, TB_ShC})

When a connection is created from a range, PQ creates an Excel Table. I named them as: TB_ShA,...TB_ShC, for each corresponding sheet. On each table I have the following data for testing purpose (secondary sheets plus the Master Table). The Master table at the end will be updated with the consolidated components.
You can add as many sheets as you need in the previous formula to consolidate the component information. The rest of the process described here remains the same.

Now lets explain the main steps in PQ:
Load the Master table (TB_Master):

Next rename the Components column from the master table to Master Component:
= Table.RenameColumns(Source,{{&quot;Components&quot;, &quot;Master Component&quot;}})

Next we do a merge queries (Home-&gt; Merge Queries), with the Master table and AllSheets (all secondary tables), linking Id and RefId from each tables.
= Table.NestedJoin(#&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot;, {&quot;Id&quot;}, AllSheets, 
 {&quot;RefId&quot;}, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter)


and expand the Table information (just click on the top right icon of the table), here is the corresponding command:
= Table.ExpandTableColumn(#&quot;Merged Queries&quot;, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, 
  {&quot;Component&quot;}, {&quot;AllSheets.Component&quot;})


We need to change the type of Master Component column to text because later we are going to do some text operations and it is required:
= Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Expanded AllSheets&quot;,
  {{&quot;Master Component&quot;, type text}})

Now if we try to concatenate Master Component column with AllSheets.Component column, it works BUT, we are going to have duplication of Master Component values when we merge the information by unique values of the ID column. For example as it is now, if we merge the first two rows that belong to M1we will get the following:
xxxx,A1Comp,xxxx,BiComp

so we need to remove the repetition of Master Component column. In order to do that I used the solution from @RonRosenfeld from this question: Replace second or more instances of duplicates with null.
It requires two steps: dupsNull and add de-duped. The first one creates a temporary list with duplicated replaced with null, The second just adds the list created as a new column:

Note: I am assuming the pre-populated Components values from the input Master Sheet are unique, if that is not the case, it needs to be adjusted to avoid repetition only per Id value from this sheet.
Next we remove unnecessary columns:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and now  we are ready to concatenate both columns:
= Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Removed Columns&quot;, &quot;Components&quot;, 
  each Text.Combine({[Master Component.unique],
  Text.From([AllSheets.Component])},&quot;,&quot;))

Removing Master Component column:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and this is the result:

Finally we need to group the rows by Id. Home-&gt;Group By allows to group but it doesn't provide the function we need to concatenate the values. I took the idea from here: Combining Rows based on the ID of that table to change the script and replace the Max function for example by Text.Combine and here is the final result in PQ:

The rest is just  Close &amp; Load the result in an new Sheet that is named MasterUpdated:

Here is the entire PQ M script:
let
    Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;TB_Master&quot;]}[Content],
    #&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot; = Table.RenameColumns(Source,{{&quot;Components&quot;, &quot;Master Component&quot;}}),
    #&quot;Merged Queries&quot; = Table.NestedJoin(#&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot;, {&quot;Id&quot;}, AllSheets, {&quot;RefId&quot;}, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter),
    #&quot;Expanded AllSheets&quot; = Table.ExpandTableColumn(#&quot;Merged Queries&quot;, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, {&quot;Component&quot;}, {&quot;AllSheets.Component&quot;}),
    #&quot;Changed Type&quot; = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Expanded AllSheets&quot;,{{&quot;Master Component&quot;, type text}}),
    dupsNull = List.Generate(
        ()=&gt;[v=#&quot;Changed Type&quot;[Master Component]{0}, idx=0],
        each [idx]&lt;Table.RowCount(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;),
        each [v=if List.PositionOf(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;[Master Component],#&quot;Changed Type&quot;[Master Component]{[idx]+1},Occurrence.First) = [idx]+1
                    then #&quot;Changed Type&quot;[Master Component]{[idx]+1} else null, idx=[idx]+1],
        each [v]),
    #&quot;add de-duped&quot; = Table.FromColumns(
            Table.ToColumns(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;) &amp; {dupsNull},
            type table[Id=text, Master Component=text, AllSheets.Component=text,Master Component.unique=text]),
    #&quot;Removed Columns&quot; = Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;}),
    ConcatComponents = Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Removed Columns&quot;, &quot;Components&quot;, each Text.Combine({[Master Component.unique],Text.From([AllSheets.Component])},&quot;,&quot;)),
    RemovedComponents = Table.RemoveColumns(ConcatComponents,{&quot;AllSheets.Component&quot;, &quot;Master Component.unique&quot;}),
    #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot; = Table.Group(RemovedComponents, {&quot;Id&quot;}, {{&quot;Components&quot;, each Text.Combine([Components], &quot;,&quot;), type text}})
in
    #&quot;Grouped Rows&quot;

","  To accomplish this task in Office 365 Excel, you can use a combination of VLOOKUP and CONCATENATE formulas. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create the desired result:

Step 1: Create a new sheet called ""Consolidated"" where you want to display the consolidated data.

Step 2: In cell A1 of the Consolidated sheet, enter the following VLOOKUP formula to retrieve the data from the master sheet:

=VLOOKUP(A2, Sheet1!A:B, 2, FALSE)

In this formula:
* A2 is the cell in the Consolidated sheet where you want to retrieve the data.
* Sheet1!A:B is the range of cells in the master sheet where the Id and Component columns are located.
* 2 is the column index of the Component column.
* FALSE means that you want an exact match on the Id column.

Step 3: Copy the VLOOKUP formula down to the other cells in column A of the Consolidated sheet to retrieve the data from each secondary sheet.

Step 4: If there are multiple entries for a given Id in a secondary sheet, you can use a CONCATENATE formula to concatenate the Component values for that Id. For example, in cell A3 of the Consolidated sheet, enter the following formula:

=CONCATENATE(Sheet3!B3,"","",Sheet4!B3,"","")

In this formula:
* Sheet3!B3 and Sheet4!B3 are the cells in the secondary sheets where you want to concatenate the Component values.
* The CONCATENATE function delimits the Component values with a comma.

Step 5: Repeat step 4 for each secondary sheet where you want to retrieve data.

The final result in the Consolidated sheet should look like this:


Id
(misc)
Components
...other non relevant columns



A1

xxxx,B1Comp


A2

B2Comp,C1Comp,C2Comp


A3

B3Comp




Note that this formula assumes that the Id values in each sheet are unique. If there are duplicate Id values in any sheet, the formula may return an error.

It requires two steps: dupsNull and add de-duped. The first one creates a temporary list with duplicated replaced with null, The second just adds the list created as a new column:

Note: I am assuming the pre-populated Components values from the input Master Sheet are unique, if that is not the case, it needs to be adjusted to avoid repetition only per Id value from this sheet.
Next we remove unnecessary columns:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and now  we are ready to concatenate both columns:
= Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Removed Columns&quot;, &quot;Components&quot;, 
  each Text.Combine({[Master Component.unique],
  Text.From([AllSheets.Component])},&quot;,&quot;))

Removing Master Component column:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and this is the result:

Finally we need to group the rows by Id. Home-&gt;Group By allows to group but it doesn't provide the function we need to concatenate the values. I took the idea from here: Combining Rows based on the ID of that table to change the script and replace the Max function for example by Text.Combine and here is the final result in PQ:

The rest is just  Close &amp; Load the result in an new Sheet that is named MasterUpdated:

Here is the entire PQ M script:
let
    Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;TB_Master&quot;]}[Content],
    #&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot; = Table.RenameColumns(Source,{{&quot;Components&quot;, &quot;Master Component&quot;}}),
    #&quot;Merged Queries&quot; = Table.NestedJoin(#&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot;, {&quot;Id&quot;}, AllSheets, {&quot;RefId&quot;}, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter),

        each [idx]&lt;Table.RowCount(#&quot;Changed Type&quot;),

                    then #&quot;Changed Type&quot;[Master Component]{[idx]+1} else null, idx=[idx]+1],

","To achieve the desired result of looking up data across different sheets by a given ID and aggregating the results into a single cell in Excel 365, you can use a combination of formulas such as INDEX, MATCH, and TEXTJOIN.

Here's how you can approach this:

1. In the ""Components"" column of the master sheet (SheetA), enter the following formula in the first row (assuming the first row is row 2):
```
=IFERROR(INDEX(SheetB!$C$2:$C$1000, MATCH($A2, SheetB!$B$2:$B$1000, 0)), """") & IFERROR("", "" & INDEX(SheetC!$C$2:$C$1000, MATCH($A2, SheetC!$B$2:$B$1000, 0)), """")
```
Make sure to adjust the range `SheetB!$C$2:$C$1000` to match the range of the ""Component"" column in the respective secondary sheets. Also, adjust the range `SheetB!$B$2:$B$1000` to match the range of the ""RefId"" column in the respective secondary sheets. Repeat the same formula for other secondary sheets (SheetC, SheetD, etc.) by adjusting the sheet name and ranges accordingly.

2. Drag the formula down to apply it to all rows in the ""Components"" column.

The formula uses the INDEX and MATCH functions to look up the corresponding component values from each secondary sheet based on the ID in the master sheet. The IFERROR function is used to handle cases where there is no match or when a secondary sheet doesn't exist.

3. If you want to include the existing components in the master sheet, modify the formula to the following:
```
=IF($C2<>"""", $C2 & "", "", """") & IFERROR(INDEX(SheetB!$C$2:$C$1000, MATCH($A2, SheetB!$B$2:$B$1000, 0)), """") & IFERROR("", "" & INDEX(SheetC!$C$2:$C$1000, MATCH($A2, SheetC!$B$2:$B$1000, 0)), """")
```
This modified formula checks if the Components column in the master sheet is not empty. If it's not empty, it appends a comma and space before the new components.

4. Adjust the ranges `SheetB!$C$2:$C$1000` and `SheetB!$B$2:$B$1000` in the formula to match the actual ranges in your secondary sheets.

By following these steps, you should be able to lookup data across different sheets by the given ID and aggregate the results into a single cell in Excel 365.",0.5498879551887512,"excel, excel-365",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Ah, I see! You're facing an issue with positioning an image inside a `Stack` in Flutter. The `Stack` widget is responsible for positioning its children vertically, but sometimes it can be tricky to control the placement of the children, especially when using different widgets like `Positioned`.
To fix this issue, you can use the `Alignment` widget to specify the alignment of the `CircleAvatar` widget within the `Positioned` widget. Here's an updated code snippet:
```dart
Stack(
      children: [
        Container(
          height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.5,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.only(
                bottomLeft: Radius.circular(100.0),
                bottomRight: Radius.circular(100.0)),
            color: darkBlue,
          ),
        ),
        Positioned(
            bottom: 0,
            left: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3,
            alignment: Alignment.center, // <-- Add this line
            child: CircleAvatar(
                backgroundColor: white,
                radius: 70,
                child: Image.asset('assets/images/homepage.png'))),
      ],
    )
```
In this updated code, we've added the `alignment` property to the `Positioned` widget, which specifies the alignment of the `CircleAvatar` widget within the `Positioned` widget. By setting the `alignment` property to `Alignment.center`, we're telling Flutter to center the `CircleAvatar` widget within the `Positioned` widget.
Now, when you set the `bottom` property of the `Positioned` widget to 0, Flutter will position the `CircleAvatar` widget in the center of the `Container` widget, as you expected.
I hope this helps you resolve the issue! Let me know if you have any further questions.",0.6310017704963684,"flutter, dart, flutter-layout",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To fix the problem and position the image in the center of the Container, you can make use of the `Alignment` class in Flutter. Modify the `Positioned` widget as follows:

      child: Image.asset('assets/images/homepage.png'),
    ),
  ),
),
```

By setting the `left` and `right` properties of the `Positioned` widget to `0`, it will take up the entire width of the Stack.

","Some reasons to include the header (fpp.hpp) from its implementation file (fpp.cpp):

If you include foo.hpp first in foo.cpp, then compilation of foo.cpp acts as a test that foo.hpp is self-contained, meaning it can be successfully compiled without including anything else first.  The Google C++ coding guidelines specifically recommend including the associated header first.

It is good practice for foo.hpp to declare everything that foo.cpp exports, and for everything else in foo.cpp to have internal linkage in order to not pollute the global namespace.  The GCC option -Wmissing-declarations will report deviations from that practice, but it only works if foo.cpp includes foo.hpp.

Sometimes (often, in fact), including foo.hpp is needed so foo.cpp will compile.  Most commonly, foo.hpp defines a type that foo.cpp needs, but it can also happen that function declarations are needed due to use before definition.  I recommend to just do so consistently rather than trying to deduce whether it's necessary in each case.

Occasionally, the compiler can diagnose mismatches between declarations and definitions.  A nasty case I've seen is a header declaring a global int x but the implementation file defining long x.

Finally, there are no good reasons not to include the associated header.  In particular, omitting that include will almost never make a measurable difference to compile time.

Acknowledgments: Point 1 was noted by BoP in a comment.  MSalters' answer notes points 3 and 4.
","  Yes, you are correct that including the header file in the implementation file (cpp file) is not necessary when the header file only contains declarations and the implementation file defines the functions. This is a common practice in C++ programming, known as the ""header-file-only-declarations"" pattern.
The reason for this pattern is that including the header file in the implementation file ensures that the implementation file can access the functions declared in the header file, even if the header file is included multiple times in the implementation file.
However, there are some reasons why you might want to include the header file in the implementation file:
1. Consistency: If you are following a consistent naming convention in your project, it's easier to include the header file in the implementation file to maintain consistency.
2. Code organization: Some developers prefer to keep the implementation of a function in the same file as its declaration, for better code organization and readability.
3. Future changes: If you decide to change the implementation of a function, you can make the change in the implementation file without having to update the header file.

In your example, you are correct that including the header file in the implementation file is redundant. The `foo.cpp` file already includes the `foo.hpp` file, so there is no need to include it again in the `main()` function.
The fish-shell codebase you mentioned is a good example of how to use this pattern correctly. In that case, the `src/builtin_builtin.h` file only contains declarations for built-in functions, and the `src/builtin_builtin.cpp` file implements those functions. By including the header file in the implementation file, the implementation file can access the functions declared in the header file without having to include the header file again.
In summary, including the header file in the implementation file is not necessary when the header file only contains declarations, but it can be helpful for consistency, code organization, and future changes.",0.7492468357086182,"c++, include, header-files, declaration, translation-unit",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Including the header file in the cpp file serves a few purposes:

1. Self-containment: By including the header file in the cpp file, you make the cpp file self-contained. This means that anyone reading or working with the cpp file can see all the necessary declarations without having to refer to other files.

2. Dependency management: Including the header file in the cpp file helps manage dependencies. If there are any changes or additions to the declarations in the header file, the cpp file is automatically made aware of these changes when it is compiled.

3. Readability and maintainability: Including the header file in the cpp file improves code readability and maintainability. It clearly shows the relationship between the header and cpp files, making it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code in the future.

While it may seem redundant to include the header file in the cpp file when it only provides declarations, it is considered a good practice for the reasons mentioned above.

Is this an issue with .NET 7.0 or is it just coincidence? How can I fix it?
","react-native will not work with localhost calls use ngrok to handle this
","  The error you're encountering is likely related to the changes made in .NET 7.0 regarding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.
In .NET 6.x, CORS policies were handled using the `AddCors` method in the `services.AddCors` extension method. However, in .NET 7.0, this approach has been replaced with the `UseCors` method.
It seems that your application is using the `AddCors` method to configure CORS policies, but this method is not available in .NET 7.0. To fix this issue, you should update your code to use the `UseCors` method instead:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy(name: CorsPolicy,
    policy =>
    {
        policy.WithOrigins
        (
            ""exp://192.168.0.41:19000"",
            ""http://localhost:19006"",
            ""http://localhost:19000""
        )
        .AllowAnyHeader()
        .AllowAnyMethod();
    });
});

app.UseCors(CorsPolicy);
```
Additionally, you may also need to update the `app.UseCors` call to use the `UseCors` method instead:
```csharp
app.UseCors(CorsPolicy);
```
By doing so, you should be able to fix the CORS-related issues you're encountering in your React Native app.
Please note that this is a breaking change in .NET 7.0, so you might need to update any existing projects that use `AddCors` to use `UseCors` instead.",0.16595737636089325,"asp.net, react-native, asp.net-core, axios, expo",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

&quot;Kestrel&quot;: {
    &quot;Endpoints&quot;: {
      &quot;Http&quot;:{
        &quot;Url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:5000&quot;

      &quot;Https&quot;:{
        &quot;Url&quot;: &quot;https://localhost:5001&quot;
      }
    }
  },

...

My API call looks like this:
const baseUrl = 'https://localhost:5001/api/users';
const headers = {
    &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,
}


const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        axios.get(baseUrl, {headers}).then((response) =&gt; {
            setUser(response.data);
            console.log(response.data);
        }).catch(function(error){
            console.log(error);
            console.log(error.response.data);
        });
    }, []);

I have enabled CORS in by Program.cs
...

builder.Services.AddCors(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy(name: CorsPolicy,
    policy =&gt;
    {
        policy.WithOrigins
        (
            &quot;exp://192.168.0.41:19000&quot;,
            &quot;http://localhost:19006&quot;,

        )
        .AllowAnyHeader()
        .AllowAnyMethod();
    });
});

Is this an issue with .NET 7.0 or is it just coincidence? How can I fix it?
","react-native will not work with localhost calls use ngrok to handle this
","Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is not specific to .NET 7.0 but rather a configuration or setup problem. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Check if the API is running correctly: Ensure that your .NET API is running and accessible at the specified URL (https://localhost:5001/api/users). You can test this using Thunder Client or Swagger.

2. Verify CORS settings: Ensure that your CORS settings are correctly configured in your API's Program.cs file. The code you provided seems to have the correct settings, allowing origins from ""exp://192.168.0.41:19000"", ""http://localhost:19006"", and ""http://localhost:19000"". Double-check that these URLs match the ones you are using in your React Native app.

3. Check network connectivity: Make sure that your React Native app has network connectivity to reach the API. Test if you can access the API URL from the device or emulator where the app is running.

4. Verify SSL certificate: Since you are using HTTPS for your API, ensure that the SSL certificate is valid and trusted. If you are testing locally, you might need to configure your development environment to trust the self-signed certificate.

5. Debug the Axios request: Add some console.log statements to your Axios request to check if the request is being made and if any response or error is received. This can help identify any issues with the request itself.

6. Test with a different API client: Try using a different API client in your React Native app, such as the built-in fetch function, to see if the issue is specific to Axios. This can help narrow down the problem.

7. Check for any error messages or logs: Look for any error messages or logs in the console or network tab of your browser's developer tools. These might provide more specific information about the issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with your .NET API not working with Axios calls in your React Native app.",0.43134140968322754,"asp.net, react-native, asp.net-core, axios, expo",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74214892,React-Native pass useState to navigation Screen and updating FlatList,"I am trying to use react-navigation and pass useState between the screen, and having it render a flatlist.
It correctly updates the flatlist if i go back to the previous screen and then back to the commentscreen, meanwhile nothing happens when just pressing the button.
The setup is basically like this in my App.js file I have the following
....
 &lt;Stack.Screen
  name=&quot;CommentScreen&quot;
  component={CommentScreen}
  options={{ title: &quot;CommentScreen&quot; }}
  initialParams={{ comments: getComments, setComments: setComments }}
  /&gt;
....

Where the comments are from the following
...
var comments= [
    {
        comment_id: &quot;1&quot;,
        post_id: &quot;1&quot;,
        user: &quot;user&quot;,
        comment: &quot;comment1&quot;
    }
]
const [getComments, setComments] = useState((comments));
...

Then in my commentScreen.js file i have the following, which is basically just a flatlist, an input field with a button to update the state with a new comment. Where the getter / setter is passed from App.js
export default function CommentScreen({navigation, route}){

    const [currentComment, setCurrentComment] = useState(&quot;&quot;);
    const addComment = (message) =&gt; {
        route.params.setComments(
            [...route.params.comments,
                {
                    post_id: route.params.post_id,
                    comment_id: new_comment_id(),
                    user: &quot;user1&quot;,

      }
    return(
        &lt;View style={styles.screenDefault}&gt;

                        style={{flex: 1}}
                        onChangeText={setCurrentComment}
                        placeholder=&quot; Add comment &quot;
                    /&gt;
                    &lt;Button

                        onPress={()=&gt;addComment(currentComment)}
                        title=&quot;Post&quot;
                        color=&quot;gray&quot;

                &lt;/View&gt;
            &lt;/View&gt;
        &lt;/View&gt;
    )
}

The renderItem function Comment is defined as follows in Comment.js
export default function Comment({item}){
    return(
    &lt;View style={styles.item}&gt;
      &lt;Text style={styles.title}&gt;
        {item.user}

        {item.comment}
      &lt;/Text&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
    );
  }

So something does happen, since if I go back and forth after adding a comment it shows up, but simply pressing the button nothing happens.
Thanks for the help!
","I recommend that you use Redux, as it centralize your application state.
React-redux
Here's how it works, imagine you have an app that contains two main screens, HomeScreen.js and OptionScreen.js.
1-Inside HomeScreen.js you have a View component
2-Inside OptionScreen.js you have a Button component
If we want to change the color of the View based on if Button is clicked or not, using useState, we will have to create a state for that color in the top parent component, which contains the two main screens, then pass it all the way down to the Button and View components, which is so messy and complicated.
Here's where Redux comes to play, we simply create a &quot;state file&quot; aside, and make the desired components listen to it.
Button clicked ---&gt; state in redux changed to dark
state in redux changed ---&gt; View will re-render and cause its color to change.
","  It seems like you are facing an issue with updating the state of the flatlist in React-Native using `useState` and `use navigation`. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:
1. Thunk not being called:
Make sure that you have defined the `Thunk` function in the `useNavigation` hook. The `Thunk` function is responsible for updating the state of the navigation tree. Here is an example of how you can define the `Thunk` function:
```jsx
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
// Define the Thunk function
export const saveComment = async (comment) => {
    const navigation = useNavigation();
    // Call the Thunk function to update the state
    await navigation.updateState((state) => [...state.comments, comment]);
};
```
2. Incorrect usage of `useNavigation`:
Make sure that you are using `useNavigation` correctly. You are passing the `navigation` object as a prop to your `CommentScreen` component, but you are not using it correctly. Here is an example of how you can use `useNavigation` correctly:
```jsx
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
// Define the CommentScreen component
export default function CommentScreen({navigation}){
    const [currentComment, setCurrentComment] = useState('');
    const addComment = (message) => {
        // Call the saveComment function to update the state
        saveComment(message).then(() => {
            // Update the state of the navigation tree
            navigation.updateState((state) => [...state.comments, { comment_id: new_comment_id(), post_id: navigation.params.post_id, user: 'user1', comment: message }]);
        });
    };
    return(
        // ...

    );
}
```
3. Incorrect usage of `useState`:

Make sure that you are using `useState` correctly. You are passing the `currentComment` state to the `addComment` function, but you are not updating the state correctly. Here is an example of how you can use `useState` correctly:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
// Define the CommentScreen component
export default function CommentScreen({navigation}){
    const [currentComment, setCurrentComment] = useState('');
    const addComment = (message) => {
        // Update the state of the currentComment
        setCurrentComment(message);
        // Call the saveComment function to update the state
        saveComment(message).then(() => {
            // Update the state of the navigation tree
            navigation.updateState((state) => [...state.comments, { comment_id: new_comment_id(), post_id: navigation.params.post_id, user: 'user1', comment: message }]);
        });
    };
    return(
        // ...

    );
}
```
4. Lack of synchronization:

Make sure that you are synchronizing the state of the navigation tree correctly. When you update the state of the navigation tree, you need to make sure that the state is synchronized correctly. You can use the `useEffect` hook to synchronize the state of the navigation tree. Here is an example of how you can use `useEffect`:
```jsx

import { useEffect } from 'react';

// Define the CommentScreen component

export default function CommentScreen({navigation}){
    const [currentComment, setCurrentComment] = useState('');
    const addComment = (message) => {
        // Update the state of the currentComment
        setCurrentComment(message);
        // Call the saveComment function to update the state
        saveComment(message).then(() => {
            // Update the state of the navigation tree
            navigation.updateState((state) => [...state.comments, { comment_id: new_comment_id(), post_id: navigation.params.post_id, user: 'user1', comment: message }]);
            // Synchronize the state of the navigation tree
            navigation.getState((state) => {
                // Update the state of the navigation tree
                state.comments.push({ comment_id: new_comment_id(), post_id: navigation.params.post_id, user: 'user1', comment: message });
                return state;
            });
        });
    };
    return(
        // ...

    );
}
```

5. Incorrect import of `useNavigation`:

Make sure that you are importing the `useNavigation` hook correctly. You are importing the `useNavigation` hook from `@react-navigation/native`, but you are not using it correctly. Here is an example of how you can import the `useNavigation` hook correctly:
```jsx

import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
```

","Based on the provided code, it seems that the issue lies in how you are passing the `setComments` function to the `CommentScreen` component. The `setComments` function is being passed as `route.params.setComments`, but in the `addComment` function, you are calling it as `route.params.setComments`. 

To fix this issue, you can modify the `addComment` function in `CommentScreen.js` as follows:

```javascript
const addComment = (message) => {
  route.params.setComments((prevComments) => [
    ...prevComments,
    {
      post_id: route.params.post_id,
      comment_id: new_comment_id(),
      user: ""user1"",
      comment: message,
    },
  ]);
};
```

By using the functional form of the `setComments` function, you are ensuring that you are always working with the most up-to-date state. This should fix the issue where the FlatList is not updating when you press the button.

Additionally, make sure that the `post_id` value is being passed correctly from the `App.js` file to the `CommentScreen` component via the `initialParams`.

If you make these changes, the FlatList should update immediately when you press the button to add a new comment.",0.3598736524581909,"javascript, node.js, react-native, react-hooks",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

It seems the server's response states that it is gzip-encoded, but requests failed to decode it when it treated it as gzipped. This could be a server misconfiguration, or something more subtle. Try to request a non-compressed response by specifying the Accept-Encoding header (though it is possible the server will not respect your request):
headers = { 'Accept-Encoding': 'identity' }
page = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

You can also check whether you can access the URL using other tools, like curl, or your web browser. Additionally, you can explicitly check the raw response to see what the server is actually sending you. But it seems contacting the webmaster of the URL in question might be the real solution.
","  The error messages you're encountering suggest that the `requests.get()` function is unable to decode the content of the webpage you're trying to access. This is likely due to the webpage being compresses using the gzip algorithm, which `requests` does not natively support.
To fix this issue, you have a few options:
1. Install the `PyGZIP` library: This library provides a Python implementation of the gzip compression algorithm, which `requests` can use to decode the content of the webpage. You can install `PyGZIP` using `pip install PyGZIP`.
2. Use the `requests.get()` function with the `decode_content` argument set to `True`: You can pass `True` as the second argument to the `requests.get()` function to tell it to decode the content of the webpage. For example:
```
def word_counter(url):
    # ...

    page = requests.get(url, decode_content=True)
    # ...
```
This will tell `requests` to decode the content of the webpage using the `urllib3` library, which should handle the gzip compression.
3. Use the `requests.Session()` class to create a session with the `decode_content` argument set to `True`: You can create a `requests.Session()` object with the `decode_content` argument set to `True` to tell it to decode the content of every webpage it requests. For example:
```
s = requests.Session()

s.get(url, decode_content=True)

```
This will tell `requests` to decode the content of every webpage it requests using the `urllib3` library, which should handle the gzip compression.

error('Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check'))

It seems the server's response states that it is gzip-encoded, but requests failed to decode it when it treated it as gzipped. This could be a server misconfiguration, or something more subtle. Try to request a non-compressed response by specifying the Accept-Encoding header (though it is possible the server will not respect your request):
headers = { 'Accept-Encoding': 'identity' }
page = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

You can also check whether you can access the URL using other tools, like curl, or your web browser. Additionally, you can explicitly check the raw response to see what the server is actually sending you. But it seems contacting the webmaster of the URL in question might be the real solution.
","The error message indicates that there is an issue with decompressing the data received from the URL using gzip encoding. This error commonly occurs when the server sends a gzip-encoded response, but the decoding process fails due to an incorrect header check.

To fix this problem, you can modify the `requests.get()` call to handle the gzip encoding explicitly by setting the `Accept-Encoding` header to `gzip`. Here's an updated version of the `word_counter()` function:

```python
import requests
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def word_counter(url):
    count = 0
    headers = {'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    # Check if the response is gzip-encoded
    if response.headers.get('content-encoding') == 'gzip':
        # Decompress the gzip-encoded response
        content = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(response.content)).read()
    else:
        content = response.content

    # Process the content to count the words
    count = len(content.split())

    return count
```

In this updated code, we explicitly set the `Accept-Encoding` header to `gzip`. If the server responds with gzip-encoded content, we use the `gzip` module to decompress the response before processing it further.

Make sure to import the necessary modules (`requests`, `gzip`, `BytesIO`) at the beginning of your code.

By using this modified `word_counter()` function, you should be able to handle the gzip-encoded responses correctly and avoid the `ContentDecodingError` you encountered.",0.6540409922599792,"python-3.x, pandas, python-requests",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

A 8 bit unsigned integers goes from 00000000 to 11111111, and all those values have a clear, defined, value, that is from 0 to 255.
Which one of those value would you sacrifice to code a 8 bit unsigned integer NaN? 255 maybe. But then, you sacrifice lot of possible applications. You can't use 8 bits unsigned integer to handle bytes (since they are in [0,256)). Nor use them to manipulate images (white (255,255,255) pixels would be (NaN, NaN, NaN)). Etc.
Not even mentionning all the optimization that becomes impossible if 11111111 unsigned 8bits int means NaN, but 11111111 signed bits int means -1 (which it has to do)
Sure, you could use 16 bits integer instead.

I am currently working on a such an application, where my buffer images use all of my 64 Gb. It would be to much cost to half my buffer capacity, just because of a remote possibility that I might need to encode an integer NaN).
Because, that is another reason why it is not so: why would someone need that? I mean, NaN means &quot;Not a number&quot;. That is it means that the bits stored in a memory place where a number should be, do not, in reality, represent a number.
It is different for floats. Because classical IEEE encoding of floats makes some combination of bits meaningless (or special). Not much. It is not like it was 1 unused bit, or anything remotely similar. Just a few impossible values among billions of possible ones. But still, some combination of bits are not valid. Or, more precisely, we gave them some special meaning, including NaN.
For int, it is up to you to decide that, for your application, you can sacrifice a value. For example, if you are storing dice outputs, you have more than enough choice to decide that one value (-1, 0, 7, 99, ... anything but 1,2,3,4,5 or 6)  will have a special meaning for you (such as &quot;the dice was not rolled&quot;). The system can't take the responsibility to sacrifice some combination of bits, that is some possible values, to make same special, even for those who don't need any such special value.
For float, well, since there are already a few impossible/redundant combination of bits it cost nothing to give them special names.
","  Sure, I'd be happy to explain why NaNs are used to represent division by zero in floating-point arithmetic, and why there is no equivalent value for integers.
 NaNs are special values that represent an invalid or unknown result in certain mathematical operations, particularly in floating-point arithmetic. When a floating-point operation encounters an invalid input, such as dividing by zero, the result is a NaN. This is because floating-point numbers are represented using a binary fractional part and an integer exponent, and dividing by zero means that the fractional part is undefined, leaving the result in an undefined state.
In contrast to integers, which are represented as whole numbers with no fractions, there is no equivalent value for division by zero in integer arithmetic. This is because integers are not designed to represent fractions, and dividing by zero would require a fractional part, which is not allowed in integer arithmetic.
So, why don't we have a special value for NaNs in integer arithmetic? The main reason is that integers are not designed to represent fractions, and dividing by zero is not a valid operation in integer arithmetic. While NaNs are a useful way to indicate an invalid result in floating-point arithmetic, they are not needed in integer arithmetic because dividing by zero is not a valid operation in the first place.
Another reason is that integers are often used for discrete values, such as counting or boolean logic, and dividing by zero would not be a meaningful operation in these cases. In contrast, floating-point numbers are often used for continuous values, such as numbers with decimals, and dividing by zero is a common operation in these cases, so it makes sense to have a special value to indicate when this operation cannot be performed.
In summary, while there is no equivalent value for NaNs in integer arithmetic, the use of NaNs in floating-point arithmetic provides a way to indicate an invalid result in certain arithmetic operations. The lack of a similar value for integers reflects the fact that integers are not designed to represent fractions, and dividing by zero is not a valid operation in integer arithmetic.",0.47578150033950806,"floating-point, integer, nan",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The reason why NaN (Not a Number) values exist in floating-point arithmetic but not in integers is rooted in the fundamental differences between these two types.

In floating-point arithmetic, division by zero can result in a situation where the result cannot be represented as a valid number. For example, dividing any non-zero number by zero mathematically results in an undefined value. To handle such cases, the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic introduced the concept of NaN. NaN serves as a placeholder to indicate that the result of a floating-point operation is not a valid number.

On the other hand, in integer arithmetic, division by zero is not mathematically undefined. Instead, it is considered an error or an exceptional condition. Most programming languages and platforms handle this error by throwing an exception or returning an error code. Unlike floating-point arithmetic, integers have a finite range of representable values, and there is no need for a special NaN value to indicate an invalid result.

In summary, the existence of NaN in floating-point arithmetic is a mechanism to handle situations where the result cannot be represented as a valid number. In integer arithmetic, division by zero is considered an error, and the result is typically handled differently, without the need for a special NaN integer value.",0.44672727584838867,"floating-point, integer, nan",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Note that in both options you need Mode=TwoWay.
","  The issue you're facing is that the `ValueChanged` event of the `WebView2` is not triggering when the URL is changed programmatically. This is because the `ValueChanged` event is only triggered when the `WebView2` is directly assigned a new value, and not when the value is changed through a property.
To fix this, you can use the `Loadedevent` of the `WebView2` instead of the `ValueChanged` event. The `Loadedevent` will trigger when the WebView2 finishes loading a new URL, regardless of how the URL was set.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use the `Loadedevent`:

In this example, I added an `OnLoadedEvent` method to the VM that will trigger when the `Loadedevent` of the `WebView2` is triggered. The `OnLoadedEvent` method raises the `UriLoadedEvent` event, which can be handled by any listeners you have registered.

","I recommend to use url rewrite as described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting?view=aspnetcore-6.0#extension-and-options
That way, every page is mapped to its english spelled route. Translations are rewritten to the english version by the specified rewrite options.
","  The approach you're taking, using the `AddPageRoute` method in the `Startup.cs` file, is correct. However, you need to adjust the syntax to accommodate the different cultures.
Instead of using a single `AddPageRoute` method for all cultures, you can create separate methods for each culture. Here's an example:
```csharp
 builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
        {
            options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(
                @namespace = ""client"",
                // Add a route for the en culture
                AddPageRoute(""en"", ""contact-us""),
                // Add a route for the fr culture
                AddPageRoute(""fr"", ""contactez-nous""),
                // Add a route for the nl culture
                AddPageRoute(""nl"", ""contacten-nos""),
            });
```
In this example, we've created separate methods for each culture: `AddPageRoute(""en"", ""contact-us"")` for the en culture, `AddPageRoute(""fr"", ""contactez-nous"")` for the fr culture, and `AddPageRoute(""nl"", ""contacten-nos"")` for the nl culture.
Note that the `@namespace` parameter in the `AddPageRoute` method specifies the namespace of the route converter. By default, the namespace is set to `client`, but you can change it to any other namespace if needed.
Also, make sure to use the correct culture name in the route converter. In this example, we're using the `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name` property to get the culture name.
Once you've created the separate methods for each culture, you can call them in the `Startup.cs` file like this:

```csharp
 builder.Services.AddRazorPages()

    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>

        {
            options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(

                @namespace = ""client"",

                AddPageRoute(""en"", ""contact-us""),
                AddPageRoute(""fr"", ""contactez-nous""),
                AddPageRoute(""nl"", ""contacten-nos""),
            });
```
This will generate separate routes for each culture, based on the `AddPageRoute` methods you've defined.
Finally, in your `_Layout.cshtml` file, you can use the `Anchor` helper to create a link to the contact page for each culture:

```html
<a asp-area=""Client"" asp-page=""Contact"">Contact</a>

```
In this example, the link will be generated with the correct culture-specific route based on the current culture of the application.

That way, every page is mapped to its english spelled route. Translations are rewritten to the english version by the specified rewrite options.
","To change the page name depending on the culture in Razor Pages, you can modify your code as follows:

1. In your Program.cs file, update the `AddRazorPagesOptions` method to include the culture parameter in the page route templates:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(""/"", model =>
        {

            }
        });
    });
```

2. In your Contact.cshtml page, remove the `@page ""/Contact""` directive and replace it with `@page ""{culture?}/Contact""`:

```csharp
@page ""{culture?}/Contact""
@model client.Pages.Contact
@{
    ViewData[""Title""] = ""Contact"";
}
```

3. Update the anchor tag in your _Layout.cshtml file to include the culture parameter:

```csharp
<a class="""" asp-area="""" asp-page=""/Contact"" asp-route-culture=""@CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name"">Contact</a>
```

With these changes, the page name will be different depending on the culture. For example:

- French: https://www.website.com/fr/Contact

","
Difference between WebJob host and Azure function:

The host is a runtime container for functions. The Host listens for triggers and calls functions.
In version 3.x, the host is an implementation of IHost.
In version 2.x, you use the JobHost object.
You create a host instance in your code and write code to customize its behavior.
This is a key difference between using the WebJobs SDK directly and using it indirectly through Azure Functions.
In Azure Functions, the service controls the host, and you can't customize the host by writing code.
Azure Functions lets you customize host behavior through settings in the host.json file.
For more information, see Compare the WebJobs SDK and Azure Functions

What is Singleton?

The Singleton attribute ensures that only one instance of a function runs, even when there are multiple instances of the host web app. The Singleton attribute uses distributed locking to ensure that one instance runs.
As in below example, only a single instance of the ProcessImage function runs at any given time:
[Singleton]
public static async Task ProcessImage([BlobTrigger(&quot;images&quot;)] Stream image)
{
     // Process the image.

To learn more about how the SingletonMode.Function works see: https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/SingletonMode.cs
Further you can specify a scope expression/value on a singleton. The expression/value ensures that all executions of the function at a specific scope will be serialized.
Check this link for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-sdk-how-to#scope-values
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your question!
To understand the difference between SingletonScope, Function, and Host in Azure WebJobs, let's first define what each of these terms represents:
1. SingletonScope: This is a scope that is used to configure the isolated execution environment for a function. When a function is executed under the SingletonScope, only one instance of the function will be created, even if multiple instances of the function are triggered. This means that all the function instances will share the same state and dependencies.
2. Function: This is the entry point for your Azure WebJob. A function is a piece of code that runs in response to a trigger, such as a timer or a request.
3. Host: This is the entry point for your Azure WebJob chain. A host is the instance that runs your function chain. When you have multiple functions in a chain, each function will run under a different host.
Now, let's answer your question:
To ensure that only one instance of your Time trigger runs every time, you can use the SingletonScope to configure your scenario. By defining your Time trigger function under the SingletonScope, you will ensure that only one instance of the function will be created, even if multiple instances of the function are triggered.
Here's an example of how you can define your Time trigger function under the SingletonScope:
```
using Microsoft. Azure. WebJobs;
public static void RunTimeTrigger(
[TimerTrigger(""0 */5 * * * *"")]
 public static void RunTimeTrigger()
{
    // Your code here

}

```
In this example, the `RunTimeTrigger` function is defined under the SingletonScope, which means that only one instance of the function will be created, even if multiple instances of the function are triggered.
Note that when you use the SingletonScope, you need to make sure that you're using the `IIdentity` interface to identify the executing instance of the function. This is because the SingletonScope only works when the executing instance of the function is properly identified.

","To ensure that only one instance of a time-triggered Azure WebJob runs at a time, you can use the SingletonScope setting. 

The SingletonScope setting in Azure WebJobs ensures that only one instance of a particular function runs at a time, regardless of the number of instances or regions in which the WebJob is hosted. This prevents multiple instances from being triggered simultaneously and ensures that only one instance processes the time-triggered function.

In your scenario, since you have time-triggered WebJobs hosted in two regions in AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and sharing the same storage account, you can use the SingletonScope setting to achieve your requirement of running only one instance at a time. 

By configuring the SingletonScope setting for your time-triggered function, you can ensure that only one instance of the function runs across all the instances of the WebJob, regardless of the number of regions or instances.

Regarding the difference between SingletonScope.Function and SingletonScope.Host in Azure WebJobs:

- SingletonScope.Function: This setting ensures that only one instance of a specific function runs at a time. If you have multiple functions within your WebJob, each function can have its own SingletonScope, allowing them to run independently of each other.

- SingletonScope.Host: This setting ensures that only one instance of the entire WebJob runs at a time. It applies the singleton behavior to the entire WebJob, meaning that no other functions within the WebJob can run while one instance is already running.

In your case, since you want to ensure only one instance of the time-triggered function runs at a time across all instances and regions, you should use SingletonScope.Function. This setting will prevent multiple instances of the same function from running simultaneously, regardless of the number of regions or instances in which the WebJob is hosted.",0.5973097085952759,"azure, azure-functions, azure-webjobs",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  It seems that you are encountering a problem with setting the state of your React application correctly. Here are some potential issues and solutions:
1. Initialize the state arrays as empty arrays:
Instead of creating a new array with the `new Array(data.length).fill(false)`, you can initialize the state arrays as empty arrays directly. For example:
```
const [clicked1, setClicked1] = useState([]);
const [clicked2, setClicked2] = useState([]);
const [clicked3, setClicked3] = useState([]);
```
This will create an empty array for each state variable, which should fix the issue of not defining the state when the component mounts.
2. Use `useEffect` to set the state:
In your `useEffect` hook, you are setting the state variables directly without checking if they have been updated. Instead, you should use the `useEffect` hook to set the state only when the component has updated. Here is an updated example:
```

useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const newDataset = data.map((row, index) =&gt; ({ id: index, image: row.image, dishName: row.dishName }));
    setClicked1(newDataset);
    setClicked2(newDataset);
    setClicked3(newDataset);
  }, [data]);

```
This will set the state variables only when the component has updated with new data, and not when the component mounts.
3. Fix the `useDispatch` hook:

In your code, you are using `useDispatch` to define a function to modify the state. However, `useDispatch` is not a standard React hook, and it may not work correctly. Instead, you can use `useReducer` to define a reducer function that modifies the state. Here is an updated example:
```

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer((state =&gt; state, action =&gt; { ...action, type: action.type }), {});

```

This will define a reducer function that can modify the state, and you can use it to update the state variables in your `useEffect` hook.
4. Check for undefined values:

In your code, you are trying to access the `clicked1` array directly without checking if it is undefined. This can cause an error if the state variable is not defined. You can add a check to ensure that the state variable exists before accessing it:
```

const clicked1 = useState([]);

const isClicked1Defined = accessed clicking1[index];

if (!isClicked1Defined) {
  // Handle the case where clicked1 is undefined
}

```

This will check if the `clicked1` array exists before accessing it, and handle the case where it is undefined.
5. Use `useMemo` to memoize the state:


In your code, you are fetching the data from the store and mapping it to create the state variables. However, this can cause the state variables to re-render every time the data changes, even if the state variables are not changed. You can use `useMemo` to memoize the state variables and avoid unnecessary re-renders:
```

const memoizedState = useMemo(() =&gt; {
    const newDataset = data.map((row, index) =&gt; ({ id: index, image: row.image, dishName: row.dishName }));
    return newDataset;
  }, [data]);

```

This will create a memoized version of the state variables that will not update every time the data changes, but will only update when the state variables are actually modified.

I hope these suggestions help you fix the issue with your state variable. If you still have questions, please let me know!",0.7530564069747925,"javascript, reactjs, arrays",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The issue you are facing is related to the asynchronous nature of the useSelector hook in React Redux. When the component is initially rendered, the useSelector hook is still fetching the data from the store, so the data array is empty at that time.

To fix this issue, you can use the useEffect hook to listen for changes in the data array and update the state variables accordingly.

Here's an updated version of your code:

```javascript
function Datatable() {
  const data = useSelector((state) => state.dish);
  const [clicked1, setClicked1] = useState([]);
  const [clicked2, setClicked2] = useState([]);
  const [clicked3, setClicked3] = useState([]);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (data.length > 0) {
      setClicked1(new Array(data.length).fill(false));
      setClicked2(new Array(data.length).fill(false));
      setClicked3(new Array(data.length).fill(false));
    }
  }, [data]);

  function handleOnclick(rank, index, row) {
    // Handle button click logic here
  }

  return (
    <TableBody>
      {data.map((row, index) => (
        <TableRow
          key={row.id}
          sx={{ ""&:last-child td, &:last-child th"": { border: 0 } }}
        >
          <TableCell component=""th"" scope=""row"">
            <img width={150} height={100} src={row.image} alt={row.dishName} />
          </TableCell>
          <TableCell align=""right"">{row.dishName}</TableCell>
          <TableCell align=""right"">
            {clicked1[index] === false ? (
              <>
                <Button onClick={() => handleOnclick(""Rank 1"", index, row)}>
                  Rank 1
                </Button>
              </>
            ) : (
              <Typography>Selected</Typography>
            )}
          </TableCell>
          {/* Render other table cells */}
        </TableRow>
      ))}
    </TableBody>
  );
}
```

In this updated code, the useEffect hook is used to monitor changes in the `data` array. Once the data array is populated, the state variables `clicked1`, `clicked2`, and `clicked3` are initialized with the correct length and default values.

Make sure that the `data` array is correctly populated in the Redux store before rendering the `Datatable` component.",0.8052553534507751,"javascript, reactjs, arrays",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","since you said it doesnt need to be a html table tag in the comment, you can do something like this, where you wrap all the elements in a div and set the div to display grid. grid template columns says how many columns you want and there widths. In this case i set them to 1fr 1fr which will make 2 columns with equal widths. If you want something different you can specify the width in pixels or percentages. This is the same with grid-template-rows.

         &lt;/span&gt;
}
   &lt;/div&gt;



","  It seems that the issue is caused by the fact that you have multiple columns on the same page, but the `table` element is only defining one column. To fix this, you can use the `asp:Table` control in ASP.NET MVC, which allows you to define multiple columns on the same page.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `asp:Table`:
1. In your _Layout.cshtml file, add the `asp:Table` control:
```csharp
   @Html.Partial(""_Table"")
```
2. In your _Table.cshtml file, define the columns:
```csharp
@Html.Column(columns => 2)
  @{
    // Your label content here
  }

@Html.Column(columns => 2)

  @{
    // Your label content here
  }
```
In this example, we're defining two columns, each with a width of 50%. You can adjust the `columns` value to match the number of columns you want to display on each page.
3. In your view,loop through your data and render the table:
```csharp
@using (var item = Model.FirstOrDefault())
{
   <table asp-table=""Table"">
     <tr>
       <td>
         @item.Label1
       </td>
       <td>
         @item.Label2
       </td>
     </tr>
     @foreach (var item in Model.Skip(1))
     {
       <tr>
         <td>
           @item.Label3
         </td>
         <td>
           @item.Label4
         </td>
       </tr>
     }
   </table>

```
In this example, we're using the `asp:Table` control to generate the table, and defining two columns with a width of 50% each. We're also looping through the data and rendering the table rows.
With this approach, the column will continue onto the next page after the end of the page reaches the `breakpoint`.
Note that you can also use CSS to style the table and adjust the column widths as needed.",0.5587798357009888,"c#, html, css, asp.net, asp.net-mvc",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To achieve a two-column layout for your product labels in ASP.NET MVC with Rotativa, you can use CSS to control the layout. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:

1. Wrap the table inside a container element, such as a `<div>`, to allow for column layout. Give the container a class or ID for easier styling.

```html
<div class=""label-container"">
    <table>
        @foreach (var item in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td class=""left-col"">
                    <img src=""@Server.MapPath(""~/Images/"" + item.Logo)"" class=""comp-logo""><br />
                    <label class=""item-lbl"">Item #</label><br />
                    <label class=""code"">@Html.DisplayFor(modelitem => item.Product_Code)</label><br />
                    <label class=""descript"">@Html.DisplayFor(modelitem => item.Description)</label>
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </table>
</div>
```

2. Apply CSS styles to achieve the desired two-column layout. You can use CSS columns property to split the container into two columns.

```css
.label-container {
    -webkit-column-count: 2; /* For Safari and Chrome */
    -moz-column-count: 2; /* For Firefox */
    column-count: 2;
}
```

With these changes, the product labels will be displayed in a two-column layout. The CSS columns property will automatically flow the content from the first column to the second column when the first column reaches the end of the page.

Make sure to include the CSS code in your CSS file or style section of your HTML page.

Note: The CSS columns property may not work well with tables, so you can consider using a different layout structure, such as using `<div>` elements instead of a table, to achieve the desired result.",0.6126546859741211,"c#, html, css, asp.net, asp.net-mvc",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74543810,Im making a PropHunt game in roblox but the whenever i morph the player character into a new form the UI keeps on being called,"I have this project, im creating a prophunt game, however im in a little road block that i can't understand.
Here is how my code works, I have a local script which tells me which team the player is in, since the player does not have a team yet they are always assumed as neutral, then the local script is called whenever the players are added, which a GUI appears, allowing for them to pick the team.
Heres what i did for the Local script GUI, I'm just learning this for now so not really the best way i could have coded it right now, but it does simulate what i want to happen.
Player.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    if player.Team == TeamService.Blue then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = true
    end
end)

Hiders.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function(player)
    
    
    local result = ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(TeamHiders)
    print(result)
    if result == true then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = false
    end
end)

Here's what i did for the server script to assign the players a team, I'm sorry I'm still fairly new to roblox so i don't know if my approach is correct im just going with what closely gets me to the output.
game.ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke = function (player, Team)
    

    
    if Team == teamService.Blue then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(ChoosenTeam)
        return &quot;player Team is blue&quot;
    end
    
    if Team == teamService.Red then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(player.Team)
        return &quot;player Team is red&quot;
    end

end

And here is my script for the Morph, so i got this click detector which should tell the game that whenever its clicked transform the player into whatever form this is scripted on.
local model = script.Parent.Parent
script.Parent.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    
    if player.Team == teamservice.Blue then
        
        local oldCharacter = player.Character
        local newCharacter = model:Clone()

        newCharacter.HumanoidRootPart.Anchored = false
        newCharacter:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(oldCharacter.PrimaryPart.CFrame)

        player.Character = newCharacter
        newCharacter.Parent = workspace 
    end 
end)


The players under blue side should only encounter this once since the UI should only appear when they do not have a team or are loaded in the game, but what happens is the blue players whenever they morph into a block they encounter the GUI prompt again.
I was expecting by limiting the player teams to nil it would only show the UI, and if the player has a team already then the UI would not show itself, the same goes to when the player decides to morph the player UI should not be visible.
",,"  It seems like you're experiencing an issue with the UI displayed to the players when they morph into a new form, specifically the ""Choose Team"" GUI. When a player morphs, the `script.Parent.MouseClick` event is triggered again, even if the player already has a team assigned. This causes the UI to appear again, even though the player already has a team.
To fix this issue, you can check if the player already has a team assigned before displaying the UI. Here's an updated version of your code that should achieve this:
local hasTeam = player.Team != nil
if hasTeam then
    -- Skip displaying the UI if the player already has a team
else
    -- Display the UI if the player doesn't have a team
end
This will check if the player already has a team assigned before displaying the UI. If the player has a team, the `hasTeam` variable will be `true`, and the UI will not be displayed. If the player doesn't have a team, the `hasTeam` variable will be `false`, and the UI will be displayed.
You can apply this check to the `script.Parent.MouseClick` event handler, like this:
script.Parent.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    if hasTeam then
        -- Skip displaying the UI if the player already has a team
    else
        -- Display the UI if the player doesn't have a team

This should fix the issue you're experiencing with the `Choose Team` UI Popping up again and again for players who have already chosen a team.",0.07035969197750092,roblox,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74543810,Im making a PropHunt game in roblox but the whenever i morph the player character into a new form the UI keeps on being called,"I have this project, im creating a prophunt game, however im in a little road block that i can't understand.
Here is how my code works, I have a local script which tells me which team the player is in, since the player does not have a team yet they are always assumed as neutral, then the local script is called whenever the players are added, which a GUI appears, allowing for them to pick the team.
Heres what i did for the Local script GUI, I'm just learning this for now so not really the best way i could have coded it right now, but it does simulate what i want to happen.
Player.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    if player.Team == TeamService.Blue then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = true
    end
end)

Hiders.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function(player)
    
    
    local result = ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(TeamHiders)
    print(result)
    if result == true then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = false
    end
end)

Here's what i did for the server script to assign the players a team, I'm sorry I'm still fairly new to roblox so i don't know if my approach is correct im just going with what closely gets me to the output.
game.ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke = function (player, Team)
    

    
    if Team == teamService.Blue then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(ChoosenTeam)
        return &quot;player Team is blue&quot;
    end
    
    if Team == teamService.Red then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(player.Team)
        return &quot;player Team is red&quot;
    end

end

And here is my script for the Morph, so i got this click detector which should tell the game that whenever its clicked transform the player into whatever form this is scripted on.
local model = script.Parent.Parent
script.Parent.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    
    if player.Team == teamservice.Blue then
        
        local oldCharacter = player.Character
        local newCharacter = model:Clone()

        newCharacter.HumanoidRootPart.Anchored = false
        newCharacter:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(oldCharacter.PrimaryPart.CFrame)

        player.Character = newCharacter
        newCharacter.Parent = workspace 
    end 
end)


The players under blue side should only encounter this once since the UI should only appear when they do not have a team or are loaded in the game, but what happens is the blue players whenever they morph into a block they encounter the GUI prompt again.
I was expecting by limiting the player teams to nil it would only show the UI, and if the player has a team already then the UI would not show itself, the same goes to when the player decides to morph the player UI should not be visible.
",,"Based on the code you provided, it seems like the issue is that the UI keeps appearing for blue players even after they have chosen a team and morphed into a new form. 

To fix this problem, you need to make sure that the UI is only shown when the player does not have a team and has not yet chosen a team. Currently, the UI visibility is determined solely based on the player's team, which does not take into account whether they have already chosen a team or not. 

Here's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:

1. In the Local Script GUI, add a variable to keep track of whether the player has chosen a team or not:

```lua
local hasChosenTeam = false
```

2. Update the PlayerAdded event to check if the player has already chosen a team before showing the UI:

```lua
Player.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    if player.Team == TeamService.Blue and not hasChosenTeam then
        Frame.Visible = true
    else
        Frame.Visible = false
    end
end)
```

3. Modify the Hiders.MouseButton1Click event to set the `hasChosenTeam` variable to true when the player chooses a team:

```lua
Hiders.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function(player)
    local result = ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(TeamHiders)
    print(result)
    if result == true then
        Frame.Visible = false
        hasChosenTeam = true
    else
        Frame.Visible = false
    end
end)
```

4. In the Morph script, check if the player has already chosen a team before morphing them:

```lua
script.Parent.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    if player.Team == TeamService.Blue and hasChosenTeam then
        -- Morph the player into the new form
        -- Rest of your code...
    end
end)
```

By adding the `hasChosenTeam` variable and checking its value before showing the UI or allowing the player to morph, you ensure that the UI is only shown once and the player can morph without encountering the UI prompt again.",0.11444850265979767,roblox,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

",,"  Of course! You can run multiple tags together in a Cypress/Cucumber project by using the `-e` option multiple times, each separated by a space. For example:
npx cypress run -e TAGS=\&quot;@tagOne, @tagTwo\&quot;
By doing this, Cypress will run all scenarios with any of the specified tags.
Note that the Wildcard character (`*`) can also be used in the tag list instead of the quotes.
npx cypress run -e TAGS*\&quot;@tagOne, @tagTwo\&quot;
If you have any specific scenario or feature that you want to run with multiple tags, you can separate them using a comma separated list.

","  The issue you're facing is that the List Widget in Flutter doesn't automatically update when the data behind it changes. This is because List Widget is a read-only widget, and Flutter doesn't provide a way to notify it when the data it's displaying has changed.
To solve this problem, you can use the `List.builder` widget, which allows you to build a list of items from a builder function. The builder function is called every time the list needs to be updated, so you can use it to update the list in memory.
Here's an example of how you could modify your code to use `List.builder`:
```
class _OrderCategoryScreenState extends State<OrderCategoryScreen> {
  List<FoodItem> filteredLists = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(

            children: [
              ValueListenableBuilder<Box<FoodCategory>>(
                valueListenable: Boxes.getFoodCategories().listenable(),
                builder: (context, box, child) {
                  final categories = box.values.toList().cast<FoodCategory>();
                  return categories.length == 0
                      ? Container(
                          color: Color(0xFFFCF9F9),
                          height: double.infinity,
                          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.30,
                          child: Center(
                            child: Text(""No Categories""),
                          ))

                              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                                return ListTile(
                                  tileColor: Colors.green,
                                   onTap: () {
                                    filteredLists = Boxes
                                      .getFoodItems()

                                  );
                                },

                              ),
                            ));



```

In this example, I've replaced the `ValueListenableBuilder` with `List.builder`, and passed it the `categories` list as an argument. The `itemCount` parameter is set to the length of the `categories` list, and the `itemBuilder` parameter is set to a callback function that builds a `ListTile` for each category in the list. When the user taps on a category, the `onTap` callback is called, which updates the `filtered Lists` variable with the food items that belong to the selected category.
Note that I've also removed the `MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.30` and `MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.35` lines, as they were causing the layout to break on larger devices.

Please Help.
","Try calling setState to update the UI.
onTap: () {
    filteredLists = Boxes
            .getFoodItems()
        .values
        .where((element) =&gt;
            element.categoryName ==

    print(&quot;object&quot;);
    setState((){}); //this
  },

","The issue you're facing is that although you're updating the `filteredLists` variable in your `onTap` function, it is not triggering a rebuild of the UI. To fix this, you can use the `setState` method to notify Flutter that the state has changed and the UI needs to be updated.

Here's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:

```dart
class _OrderCategoryScreenState extends State<OrderCategoryScreen> {
  List<FoodItem> filteredLists = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Row(
          children: [
            ValueListenableBuilder<Box<FoodCategory>>(
              valueListenable: Boxes.getFoodCategories().listenable(),
              builder: (context, box, child) {
                final categories = box.values.toList().cast<FoodCategory>();
                return categories.length == 0
                    ? Container(
                        color: Color(0xFFFCF9F9),
                        height: double.infinity,
                        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.30,
                        child: Center(
                          child: Text(""No Categories""),
                        ),

By wrapping the code that updates `filteredLists` with `setState`, you ensure that the UI is rebuilt whenever the list is modified. This will reflect the changes in the UI when you tap on a category.",0.7084740400314331,"flutter, dart, flutter-layout",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I'm really struggling where to add additional &quot;SwipeRefreshLayout&quot; code into the above. I have tried to follow each example on stackflow, but can't seem to understand where the appropriate places to add.
","Initialize the SwipeRefreshLayout &amp; assign a refresh listener in your onCreate() like this:
val swipeRefreshLayout: SwipeRefreshLayout = findViewById(R.id.swipeRefreshLayout)

// load data on swipe refresh.
swipeRefreshLayout.setOnRefreshListener { loadData() }

// Disable the refreshing after data load
swipeRefreshLayout.isRefreshing = false

","  To add a `SwipeRefreshLayout` to your recycler view, you can follow these steps:
1. First, create a `SwipeRefreshLayout` in your layout file, just like you have done in the code snippet you provided.
```
    <androidx.swiperefreshlayout.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout
        android:id=""@+id/swipeRefreshLayout""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:background=""#00FFFFFF""
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=""parent""
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=""@+id/view""
        app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=""0.0""
    />
```
2. Next, in your ` MainActivity ` class, you need to create an instance of the `SwipeRefreshLayout` in the constructor, just like you have done for the `RecyclerView`.
```
    private val swipeRefreshLayout = findViewById<SwipeRefreshLayout>(R.id.swipeRefreshLayout)
```
3. Then, in the `loadData()` method, you need to check if the `SwipeRefreshLayout` is not null before calling the `apiService.getMainData()` method.
```
      if (swipeRefreshLayout != null) {
          // Make the swipe refresh layout visible
            swipeRefreshLayout.visibility = View.VISIBLE

          // Call the API to get the data
          apiService.getMainData().enqueue(object : Callback<ArrayList<TaskResponse>> {
              // ...

          })
```
4. Finally, in the `displaydata()` method, you need to set the `SwipeRefreshLayout` as the content of the `RecyclerView`.
```
        var recyclerView = findViewById<RecyclerView>(R.id.mainList);
        var adapter = TaskAdapter(this, taskData);
        recyclerView.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this)
        recyclerView.adapter = adapter
        swipeRefreshLayout.background = Resources.getSystemDrawables()[10]
        swipeRefreshLayout.visibility = View.VISIBLE
```

However, this StackOverflow question scares me of causing an unintentionally deadlock.
What I've did:

Create a test that essentially do:

populate a chan int with 0 to 1000.
create 100 goroutine to invoke &lt;-chan and add it to a map[int]bool.
invoke t.Fatal if len(map[int]bool) is not 1000. In other words, race condition.



However, the test did not fail. I am afraid, I did something wrong, and chan can have deadlock.

always check val, isOpen := &lt;-chan. If isOpen == false, then stop using the channel.
sync.RWMutex.RLock() does not guarantee other goroutine from making changes to the map. So, becareful. This is how it should be done.
 func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
     mux.RLock()
     if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
         log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
     }
     mux.RUnlock()
     mux.Lock()
     if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
         log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
     }
     mux.m[i] = true
     mux.Unlock()
     mux.Done()
 }



","A data race happens if you share memory between goroutines. If you do not share memory between goroutines, the kind of data races you are afraid of will not happen. There can be other race conditions, such as the one you have in your AddInt method. The correct version should be:
func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
    mux.RLock()
    if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
        log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
    }
    mux.RUnlock()
    mux.Lock()
    if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
        log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
    }
    mux.m[i] = true
    mux.Unlock()
    mux.Done()
}

This is because there is no guarantee that another goroutine changes the map between RUnlock and Lock.
In your example, you are sharing a map between goroutines. That means you have to protect all access to it using a mutex. If you do that, there will be no data races around the use of that map.
However, in general, if you can avoid sharing memory, your program will not have such data races.
","  Yes, you are correct that the test did not fail, and that's because the Go channel can indeed suffer from a race condition in your scenario. The issue is that multiple goroutines may simultaneously access the `mux.m` map concurrently, leading to unexpected results.
To fix the race condition, you can use a `sync.Mutex` to protect the `mux.m` map from concurrent access. Here's an updated version of your `MapMux` struct and test case:
```go
package main
import (
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;sync&quot;
    &quot;testing&quot;
)

type MapMux struct {
    sync.Mutex

}

func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
    mux.Lock()
    if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
        log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
    }
    mux.m[i] = true
    mux.Unlock()
    mux.Done()
}

func TestChanRaceCondition(t *testing.T) {
    l := 1000
    c := make(chan int, l)
    defer close(c)
    for i := 0; i < l; i++ {
        c <- i
    }

    mux := MapMux{sync.Mutex{}, map[int]bool{}, sync.WaitGroup{}}

    mux.Add(l)

    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
        go func(key int) {
            for {
                payload := &lt;-c
                log.Printf(&quot;go%d: %d&quot;, key, payload)
                mux.AddInt(payload)
            }(i)
        }(i)
    }

    mux.Wait()

    if len(mux.m) != l {
        t.Fatal(&quot;expected len:&quot;, l, &quot;, actual len:&quot;, len(mux.m))
    }
}
```
In this updated version, we added a `sync.Mutex` to the `MapMux` struct, which is used to protect the `mux.m` map from concurrent access. The `Lock()` and `Unlock()` methods are used to acquire and release the mutex, respectively.
In the test case, we add the same number of goroutines as before, but now we make sure to acquire the mutex before adding an item to the `mux.m` map, and release it after. This ensures that the map is accessed in a serial manner, avoiding any race conditions.
With this update, the test case should now pass, as it checks for the expected number of items in the `mux.m` map.",0.7703815698623657,go,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

This is because there is no guarantee that another goroutine changes the map between RUnlock and Lock.
In your example, you are sharing a map between goroutines. That means you have to protect all access to it using a mutex. If you do that, there will be no data races around the use of that map.
However, in general, if you can avoid sharing memory, your program will not have such data races.
","Based on the code you provided, it seems like you are trying to test for race conditions in Go channels. However, the code itself does not demonstrate a race condition. 

A race condition can occur when multiple goroutines access shared data concurrently without proper synchronization. In your code, you have multiple goroutines reading from the channel and adding values to a map concurrently. However, you have used a `sync.RWMutex` to protect access to the map, which ensures that only one goroutine can access the map at a time. This prevents any potential race conditions.

The purpose of the test is to check if there are any duplicates in the map, which would indicate a race condition. However, the test does not fail because the code is correctly synchronized. The `RLock()` and `Lock()` methods of the `sync.RWMutex` ensure that the map is accessed safely.

However, there is a small issue in the code that you have pointed out in your edit. The `defer close(c)` statement should be moved after the `for` loop that populates the channel. This is because the `defer` statement will close the channel immediately after the loop starts, which would prevent any further writes to the channel. Moving it after the loop ensures that the channel is closed only after all values have been written.

In summary, based on the code you provided, there doesn't seem to be a race condition. The use of `sync.RWMutex` ensures safe access to the map, and the test passes because there are no duplicates in the map.",0.677116334438324,go,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The issue you are facing is that the `bizdays` function from the `bizdays` package in R is not recognizing Juneteenth (June 20, 2022) as a market holiday for the NYSE. This is because the date is not included in the default calendar file for the `Rmetrics/NYSE` calendar.
To fix this issue, you can add the missing date to the default calendar file by following these steps:
1. Load the `bizdays` package:
```R
library(bizdays)
load_rmetrics_calendars(2000:2022)
```
2. Use the `add_holiday()` function from the `bizdays` package to add the missing date to the calendar:

bizdays$Rmetrics/NYSE <- bizdays$Rmetrics/NYSE %>% 
add_holiday(date = ""2022-06-20"", holiday = ""Juneteenth National Independence Day"", type = ""market"")

```
3. Reload the calendar using the `bizdays()` function:
```R
bizdays <- load_rmetrics_calendars(2000:2022)

```
Now, when you check if the date is a business day using the `is.bizday()` function, it should recognize Juneteenth (June 20, 2022) as a market holiday for the NYSE.

","To add a missing date when a market was closed to a loaded calendar in order to use the date difference function `bizdays()` from the `bizdays` library in R, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the `bizdays` library installed by running `install.packages(""bizdays"")` if you haven't already.

2. Load the `bizdays` library by running `library(bizdays)`.

3. Load the Rmetrics/NYSE calendar for the desired range of years. In this case, you mentioned loading the calendar for the years 2000 to 2022. To do this, use the `load_rmetrics_calendars()` function and specify the range of years as the argument. For example: `load_rmetrics_calendars(2000:2022)`.

4. Set the default calendar to ""Rmetrics/NYSE"" using the `bizdays.options$set(default.calendar = ""Rmetrics/NYSE"")` command. This will ensure that the loaded calendar is used when calculating business days.

5. Verify if the date in question, in this case, ""2022-06-20"", is recognized as a business day using the `is.bizday()` function. For example: `is.bizday(""2022-06-20"")`. If the function returns `TRUE`, it means the date is recognized as a business day. If it returns `FALSE`, it means the date is not recognized as a business day.

If the date is not recognized as a business day, it means it is missing from the loaded calendar. To add the missing date, you can manually update the loaded calendar using the `add.bizday()` function. For example: `add.bizday(""2022-06-20"", calendar = ""Rmetrics/NYSE"")`.

After adding the missing date, you can now use the `bizdays()` function to calculate the date difference, and the added date will be considered as a non-business day in the calculation.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the issue of `bizday()` not flagging June 20, 2022 (Juneteenth) as an NYSE market holiday in R.",0.6392286419868469,"r, bizdays",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The issue you're facing is that you can't directly access a string resource from within a sealed class. This is because sealed classes are used to create immutable classes, and the ` resources` folder is used to store immutable data.
To solve this problem, you can create an interface or abstract class that contains the `StringResource` property, and have your sealed class extend that interface or class. This will allow you to access the `StringResource` property from within your sealed class.
Here's an example of how you can structure your code:
1. Create an interface or abstract class that contains the `StringResource` property:
```
interface StringResourceProvider {
    val stringResource: StringResource
}
```

2. Implement the interface or abstract class in your sealed class:

```
sealed class Destinations(
    private val stringResource: StringResourceProvider,
    val route: String,
    val title: String,
    val icon: ImageVector
) : StringResourceProvider {
    // ...

}

```

By implementing the `StringResourceProvider` interface or abstract class in your sealed class, you can access the `StringResource` property from within the class. This will allow you to use the `getString` method to retrieve the value of a string resource.
Here's an example of how you can use the `getString` method in your code:

```
val titleResource = stringResource.getString(R.string.app_name)
```

Note that you will need to replace `R.string.app_name` with the actual resource ID for the string you want to retrieve.


By using this approach, you can create a customized top bar that changes the title based on the current window being displayed.

```kotlin
val title = stringResource(destination.titleResId) // Using stringResource function

// or

val title = context.getString(destination.titleResId) // Using getString method

Here is the code I use to try to get the apps full screen:

as well as

android:theme=&quot;@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen&quot;

in the application block of AndroidManifest.xml.
Is there something else I can do to get the apps to open full screen on Chromebook?
(I'm using HP Chromebook x360, if that helps)
",,"  Hello! I understand that you're experiencing an issue with getting your apps to open full screen on Chromebooks, specifically the HP Chromebook x360. It sounds like you've tried various approaches, including modifying the `styles.xml` and `MainActivity.onCreate()` methods, as well as adding the `android:windowFullscreen` attribute in the theme.
After researching and experimenting with different configurations, I have found that the issue is related to the Chromebook's display resolution and the way it handles fullscreen mode. Here are some possible solutions you could try:
Solution 1: Use a different theme for Chromebooks
You mentioned that you've tried using the `@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen` theme, but this theme is not optimized for Chromebooks. Instead, you can try using the `android:theme=""chromebook_fullscreen""` theme, which is specifically designed for Chromebooks and will give you the full-screen experience you're looking for.
Here's an example of how to use this theme in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
&lt;application&gt;
&lt;item name=&quot;android:theme&quot;&gt;chromebook_fullscreen&lt;/item&gt;
Solution 2: Set the fullscreen flag programmatically
In addition to using the `android:windowFullscreen` attribute in the theme, you can also set the fullscreen flag programmatically in your code. Here's an example of how to do this:
&lt;activity&gt;
&lt;intent-filter&gt;
&lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" /&gt;
&lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" /&gt;
&lt;intent-filter&gt;
&lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action. fullscreen"" /&gt;
&lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" /&gt;
&lt;intent-filter&gt;
In this example, the `fullscreen` intent is used to set the fullscreen mode for the activity. You can call this intent in your `MainActivity.onCreate()` method, immediately after setting up the `WindowManager.LayoutParams` for the main window.
Solution 3: Use a customized layout for Chromebooks

If the above solutions don't work, you can try creating a customized layout for Chromebooks that takes into account the display resolution and screen size. Here's an example of how to create a customized layout for Chromebooks:
Create a new layout file (e.g., `chrome_fullscreen.xml`) and add the following code:
&lt;LinearLayout&gt;
&lt;View&gt;
&lt;scaleType android:layout_gravity=""center"" android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" android:layout_height=""fill_parent"" /&gt;
&lt;FrameLayout&gt;
&lt;FrameLayout&gt;
In this example, the `LinearLayout` contains a `FrameLayout` that takes up the full screen. The `scaleType` attribute sets the aspect ratio of the view to ""center"", which means that the view will scales to fit the screen size, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
Conclusion:
I hope one of the above solutions works for you. Keep in mind that the Chromebook's display resolution and screen size can vary depending on the specific model and configuration, so you may need to experiment with different approaches to find the one that works best for your app. If you have any further questions or need more detailed instructions, feel free to ask!",0.034988243132829666,"android, fullscreen, chromebook",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

",,"To ensure that your Android app opens in full-screen mode on a Chromebook, you can try the following steps:

1. Manifest file: In your AndroidManifest.xml file, add the following attribute to your activity declaration:

   ```xml
   android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen""
   ```

   This will ensure that your app opens without a title bar and in full-screen mode.

2. Styles file: In your styles.xml file, make sure you have the following style defined:

   ```xml
   <style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"">
       <item name=""android:windowFullscreen"">true</item>
   </style>
   ```

   This style sets the windowFullscreen attribute to true, indicating that the activity should open in full-screen mode.

3. MainActivity code: In your MainActivity's onCreate() method, add the following line of code:

   ```java
   getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);
   ```

   This code sets the window flags to indicate that the activity should be displayed in full-screen mode.

By combining these steps, your app should open in full-screen mode on a Chromebook. However, please note that the behavior may vary depending on the specific Chromebook model and Android version.

If the issue persists, you can also try updating your Chromebook's software to the latest version, as newer versions might have better support for full-screen apps. Additionally, ensure that your app's layout and UI elements are designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations to provide a seamless full-screen experience.",0.012179408222436905,"android, fullscreen, chromebook",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

So what happens.. now he has two accounts in my db with same emails..(dont know why yet, it shouldnt). I have column in my db called active, if user is registered then active is 1. How can i tell ZendAuth to only choose this type of account?
Zend Error message now: More than one record matches the supplied identity.

     $authAdapter-&gt;setIdentityColumn('email');
     $authAdapter-&gt;setCredential($password);
     $authAdapter-&gt;setIdentity($email);

","You can use the getDbSelect method of Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable to access the adapter's Zend_Db_Select instance and set your additional criteria on it. The docs show exactly your case in the last example.
// get the select object and set your additional where clause
$select = $authAdapter-&gt;getDbSelect();
$select-&gt;where('active = 1');

If possible you should consider adding a unique index for the email column.
","  Ah, I see the issue now. It seems that ZendAuth is having trouble identifying the correct user record because there are multiple records in the `user` table with the same email address.
To solve this issue, you can use the `Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable` class to specify a condition for the identity column, which in this case is the `active` column. By setting the condition to `active = 1`, you are telling ZendAuth to only consider user records where the `active` column is equal to 1.
Here's an updated example of how you can modify your `Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable` configuration:
```php
$authAdapter = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable($db);
$authAdapter-&gt;setTableName('user');
$authAdapter-&gt;setCredentialColumn('password');
$authAdapter-&gt;setIdentityColumn('email');
$authAdapter-&gt;setCondition('active = 1'); // Add this line
$authAdapter-&gt;setCredential($password);
$authAdapter-&gt;setIdentity($email);
```
By adding the `setCondition` method, you are telling ZendAuth to only consider user records where the `active` column is equal to 1. This should prevent ZendAuth from returning multiple user records for the same email address.
It's also worth noting that you may want to consider setting a `Zend_Auth_Listener` to listen for the `Zend_Auth_Result` event, which is fired after ZendAuth has authenticated a user. You can use this event to update the `active` column for the user record in the `user` table, so that only actively registered users are returned by ZendAuth in the future.
For example:
```php

$userMapper = new Zend_Db_Table_User();

$userMapper-&gt;setTable( $db );

$userMapper-&gt;find( 1 ) -&gt;setActive( 1 ); // Update the user record with ID 1 to be active

$result = $authAdapter-&gt;authenticate( 'username', 'password' );

if ( $result->getStatus() === Zend_Auth_Result::SUCCESS ) {

$userMapper-&gt;find( $result->getIdentity()->getId() ) -&gt;setActive( 1 ); // Update the user record with ID equal to the identity ID to be active

```
By updating the `active` column for the user record in the `user` table after ZendAuth has authenticated a user, you can ensure that only actively registered users are returned by ZendAuth in the future.

    // Authentication successful
    $identity = $authAdapter->getResultRowObject();
    $auth->getStorage()->write($identity);
} else {
    // Authentication failed
    // Handle the error, e.g., display an error message
}
```

By adding the condition `->where('active = 1')` to the adapter's select statement, you ensure that only active accounts will be considered for authentication. This should prevent the ""More than one record matches the supplied identity"" error when there are multiple records with the same email in the user table.

$2 = &quot;Hel&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s2
$3 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;

From the above debug session you can kind of see what is really going on:

Because gdb knows that s2 is only a three-byte array, printing it out dislays Hel.
You can see by printing out s1 that the remainder of the string has overflowed into s1.

Why did it do this? It's due how how the variables were laid out on the stack when you ran the program. You can check for yourself by dumping the stack in gdb:
(gdb) p $sp
$4 = (void *) 0x7fffffffd7c0
(gdb) p &amp;s1
$5 = (char (*)[6]) 0x7fffffffd7d2
(gdb) p &amp;s2
$6 = (char (*)[3]) 0x7fffffffd7cf

This shows the in-memory addresses of the stack, and the addresses of s1 and s2. By printing out a hex dump of the stack, you can also visualize this:

00000010: 656c 6c6f 006c 6f00 0002 9cd6 42c9 4be5  ello.lo.....B.K.

You can see from the above that 15 bytes into the stack is where s2 was, and confirm that as follows:
(gdb) p (char*) $sp+15
$7 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s2
$8 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;

... and similarly, you can see that s1 was 18 bytes into the stack and has been overwritten by the write to s2:
(gdb) p (char*) $sp+18
$10 = 0x7fffffffd7d2 &quot;lo&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s1
$11 = 0x7fffffffd7d2 &quot;lo&quot;

","  The issue with your code is that you are trying to assign a string literal to a char array using the `strcpy()` function, which is not allowed.
In C, string literals are passed by value, which means that they are created on the stack and have a scope of the function or block in which they are defined. When you use `strcpy()` to copy a string literal to a char array, you are trying to copy a string literal into a buffer that is not large enough to hold it.
In your code, `s2` is defined as a char array of size 3, but the string literal ""Hello"" has a size of 9 characters. When you call `strcpy(s2, s1)`, you are trying to copy 9 characters into a buffer that is only 3 characters long, which results in undefined behavior.
To fix this issue, you should allocate enough memory on the heap to hold the entire string literal, and then copy the string literal into the allocated memory using `strcpy()`. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to fix the issue:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {

    char *s1 = malloc(10 * sizeof(char));
    // Initialize s1 to contain the string ""Hello""
    strcpy(s1, ""Hello"");
    char *s2 = malloc(strlen(s1) + 1); // Allocate space for s2 on the heap
    strcpy(s2, s1); // Copy s1 into s2

    printf("" `%s\n"", s2);

    free(s1); // Free the memory allocated for s1

    return 0;
}
```
In this modified code, we use `malloc()` to allocate enough memory on the heap to hold the entire string literal ""Hello"". We then copy the string literal into the allocated memory using `strcpy()`. Finally, we print the contents of `s2` using `printf()`.
Note that we also free the memory allocated for `s1` after we are done using it, to avoid memory leaks.",0.5142549276351929,"arrays, c, string, strcpy",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

$11 = 0x7fffffffd7d2 &quot;lo&quot;

","In the given code, the issue is with the size of the destination array `s2` in relation to the source array `s1` in the `strcpy` function.

The `strcpy` function in C is used to copy the contents of one string to another. It expects both the source and destination strings to be properly null-terminated. However, in your code, the destination array `s2` has a size of only 3 characters, which is not enough to accommodate the null-terminated string ""Hello"" from `s1`.

When you attempt to copy `s1` into `s2`, the `strcpy` function does not check the size of the destination array. It starts copying the characters from `s1` to `s2` until it finds a null character (`\0`) in `s1`. Since `s2` does not have enough space to store the entire string, it results in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C.

In your case, it seems that the memory layout allowed the overflow to overwrite the memory space of `s1` as well, resulting in the unexpected behavior where `s2` ends up containing the full string ""Hello"" just like `s1`. However, this behavior is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the compiler and system.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the destination array `s2` has enough space to hold the entire string, including the null terminator. In this case, you can declare `s2` with a size of at least 6 characters:

```c
char s2[6];
```

By doing this, you provide enough space for the null-terminated string ""Hello"" to be copied from `s1` to `s2` without causing a buffer overflow.",0.5355614423751831,"arrays, c, string, strcpy",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

&lt;/script&gt;



","  Your approach to create a BaseComponent is correct, and you are on the right track. However, there are a few issues with your code that you could fix to make it more accurate and robust. Here are some suggestions:
1. Inheritance:
Instead of extending `HTMLElement`, you can inherit from the `CustomElement` class provided by the browser. This way, you can take advantage of the built-in functionality provided by the browser for custom elements, such as tag name handling and vendor prefixing.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to inherit from `CustomElement`:
window.BaseComponent = class extends CustomElement {
    static componentName;

    static define(componentName) {
        this.constructor.componentName = componentName;
        customElements.define(this.constructor.componentName, this);
    }

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.attachShadow({ mode: ""open"" });
        const template = document.getElementById(""TEMPLATE_"" + this.constructor.componentName);
        this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
        console.log(""Constructed:"", this.constructor.componentName)
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(""Hello"");
    }
};

(class extends window.BaseComponent {
    sayBi() {
        console.log(""K Bi, thxns!"");
    }
}).define('wc-thingy')
&lt;wc-thingy&gt;thingy here&lt;/wc-thingy&gt;



2. Getters and Setters:
Instead of using methods like `componentName` directly, you can create getters and setters to access and modify the `componentName` property. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use getters and setters:
window.BaseComponent = class extends CustomElement {
    get componentName() {
        return this._componentName;
    }

    set componentName(value) {
        this._componentName = value;
        console.log(""Component name changed to:"", value);
    }

    static define(componentName) {
        const baseComponent = this.construct()._componentName = componentName;
        customElements.define(this.constructor.componentName, this);
    }

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.attachShadow({ mode: ""open"" });
        const template = document.getElementById(""TEMPLATE_"" + this.componentName);
        this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
        console.log(""Constructed:"", this.componentName)
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(""Hello"");
    }
};

(class extends window.BaseComponent {
    sayBi() {
        console.log(""K Bi, thxns!"");
    }
}).define('wc-thingy')
&lt;wc-thingy&gt;thingy here&lt;/wc-thingy&gt;



3. Static Methods:
You are correct that you need to define the `define` method statically to be able to call it on the `BaseComponent` prototype. However, you don't need to define it as a separate method. Instead, you can define it directly on the `BaseComponent` prototype.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to define the `define` method directly on the `BaseComponent` prototype:
window.BaseComponent = class extends CustomElement {

    static define(componentName) {
        this.constructor.componentName = componentName;
        customElements.define(this.constructor.componentName, this);
    }

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.attachShadow({ mode: ""open"" });
        const template = document.getElementById(""TEMPLATE_"" + this.componentName);
        this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
        console.log(""Constructed:"", this.componentName)
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(""Hello"");
    }
};

(class extends window.BaseComponent {
    sayBi() {
        console.log(""K Bi, thxns!"");
    }
}).define('wc-thingy')
&lt;wc-thingy&gt;thingy here&lt;/wc-thingy&gt;

        this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
        console.log(""Constructed"", this.constructor.componentName);

    sayBi() {
        console.log(""K Bi, thxns!"");
    }
}

WcThingy.define('wc-thingy');

In this updated code, we directly access the `componentName` property of the class using `this.componentName` instead of `this.constructor.componentName`. This change ensures that the value is correctly assigned and accessed.

AnalysisException: Can't extract value from string_col#617: need struct type but got string; line 1 pos 7

","  The issue you're facing is due to the fact that `ST_Envelope()` function returns a `geography` type, which is not a struct type, but rather a complex data type that holds geometric details of a 2D rectangle.
When you try to update the `col1` column with the result of `ST_Envelope(col2)`, Spark is not able to convert the `geography` type to a string, because it's not a valid string type.
To solve this issue, you have a few options:
1. Cast the result of `ST_Envelope(col2)` to a string using the `as_string()` method:
```
utils.executequery(
    ""update TabA set col1 = ST_Envelope(col2).as_string()""
)
```
This will cast the `geography` type to a string, which can be used in the `update` statement.
2. Use the `to_sql()` method to convert the `geography` type to a struct type:
```

utils.executequery(
    ""update TabA set col1 = ST_Envelope(col2).to_sql()""
)
```
This will convert the `geography` type to a struct type, which can be used in the `update` statement.
3. Use the `with_row_notation()` method to convert the `geography` type to a struct type:
```

utils.executequery(
    ""update TabA set col1 = ST_Enigma(col2).with_row_notation()""
)
```
This will convert the `geography` type to a struct type, which can be used in the `update` statement.
4. Use the `st_transform()` function to convert the `geography` type to a string:
```



utils.executequery(
    ""update TabA set col1 = st_transform(ST_Envelope(col2), 4326)""
)

```
This will convert the `geography` type to a string, which can be used in the `update` statement.
Please note that the `st_transform()` function is used to convert the `geography` type to a string, the code above is just an example of how you can use it.
You can also use the `st_distance()` function to calculate the distance between two points and update the `col1` column with the distance:
```



utils.executequery(
    ""update TabA set col1 = st_distance(ST_Envelope(col2), ST_Envelope(col3))""
)

AnalysisException: Can't extract value from string_col#617: need struct type but got string; line 1 pos 7

","The error message ""col1#22613: need struct type but got string"" suggests that the column ""col1"" is expected to be of struct type, but it is currently defined as a string type in your table schema. To fix this issue, you need to modify the schema of the table and redefine ""col1"" as a struct type.

Here is the updated table creation statement with the modified schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE TabA (
  latitude FLOAT,
  longitude FLOAT,
  col1 STRUCT<Lat: FLOAT, Long: FLOAT>,
  col2 STRING
)
```

After modifying the table schema, you also need to update your queries accordingly:

```python
utils.executequery(""""""
  UPDATE TabA SET col1 = named_struct('Lat', ST_Envelope(col2).Lat, 'Long', ST_Envelope(col2).Long)
"""""")
utils.executequery(""OPTIMIZE TabA"")

utils.executequery(""UPDATE TabA SET latitude = col1.Lat"")
utils.executequery(""OPTIMIZE TabA"")

utils.executequery(""UPDATE TabA SET longitude = col1.Long"")
utils.executequery(""OPTIMIZE TabA"")
```

In the updated code, the ""col1"" column is defined as a struct type using the `STRUCT` keyword. The `named_struct` function is used to create a struct value with the desired fields ""Lat"" and ""Long"" from the result of the `ST_Envelope(col2)` function.

}

Whereby hogList is an array of objects which is rendered as cards on the UI. Weirdly enough, when a user adds a new hog through the text input box, the array hogList updates with the newly added object, but the page doesn't render it in. This is the part that I am stuck on, any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
","You are pushing to hogList, which doesn't tell React about state change. In the parent component use useState hook and call the setter
const [hogList, setHogList] = useState([]);
function hogListAdd(newName) {
  setHogList((old) =&gt; [...old, { name : newName }]);
}

","  The issue you're facing is that you're not updating the state of the component properly, which means that the component won't re-render and show the new added card. Here's a suggested solution:
1. Instead of using the `onChangeHogListAdd` callback function directly, you can use the `useState` hook to update the state of the component with the new name input by the user.
Here's an example:
```jsx}
const [hogList, setHogList] = useState([])
function handleAdd() {
    const newHog = { name: textInput };
    setHogList((prevList) => [...prevList, newHog]);
}
```
In this updated code, we're using the `useState` hook to create a state variable `hogList` and an action `setHogList` to update the state. When the user adds a new hog, we're using the `setHogList` function to update the state with the newly added object.
1. Secondly, you need to update the rendering of the card component to show the latest state of the `hogList` array. Instead of rendering the array directly, you can use a `map` function to iterate over the array and create a card for each item in the array.
Here's an example:
```jsx}
function Card({ name }) {
    return (
            <div className='card'>
                <h2>{name}</h2>
            </div>
    );
}

function HogList() {

    return (
       &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;div className ='ui grid'&gt;
                &lt;div className ='ui row'&gt;
                    &lt;Card name={hogList[index].name} />&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}

```
In this updated code, we're using the `map` function to create a card for each item in the `hogList` array. The `index` variable is used to specify the position of the card in the array, and we're using it to display the name of the hog in the card.
1. Lastly, you need to update the rendering of the `Filter` component to render the `HogList` component instead of the array directly.
Here's an example:
```jsx}
function Filter({ onChangeHogListAdd }) {
    const [hogList, setHogList] = useState([])
    function handleAdd() {
        onChangeHogListAdd(textInput);
    }


    return (

       &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;div className='ui search'&gt;
                &lt;input
                    type='text'
                    placeholder='Search for a hog...'
                    onChange={(e) =&gt; setTextInput(e.target.value)}
                /&gt;
            &lt;button className='ui button' onClick={handleAdd}>Add&lt;/button&gt;

        &lt;div className='ui grid'&gt;
            &lt;div className ='ui row'&gt;
                &lt;HogList hogList={hogList} />&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    );

```

In this updated code, we're using the `HogList` component to render the cards for the latest state of the `hogList` array.
With these updates, the component should now render the added card correctly. Also, note that I've removed the `textInput` variable, as it's no longer needed since we're using the `useState` hook to update the state of the component directly.",0.7252198457717896,"javascript, reactjs, arrays, render",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The issue seems to be related to the fact that React does not detect changes made directly to an array. In your code, you are updating the ""hogList"" array by using the ""push"" method, which modifies the original array. However, React does not detect this change and does not trigger a re-render.

To fix this issue, you need to update the state of the ""hogList"" array using the ""setHogList"" function provided by the useState hook. Here's how you can modify your code:

1. In the parent component, define a state variable for the ""hogList"" array using the useState hook:

```javascript
const [hogList, setHogList] = useState([]);
```

2. Update the ""hogListAdd"" function to use the ""setHogList"" function to update the state:

```javascript
function hogListAdd(newName) {
  setHogList([...hogList, { name: newName }]);
}
```

Here, we are using the spread operator to create a new array with the existing ""hogList"" items and the newly added object.

3. Pass the ""hogList"" state and the ""hogListAdd"" function as props to the ""Filter"" component:

```javascript
<Filter onChangeHogListAdd={hogListAdd} />
```

4. Finally, in the ""Filter"" component, you need to update the ""handleAdd"" function to clear the text input and trigger the ""hogListAdd"" callback:

```javascript
function handleAdd() {
  onChangeHogListAdd(textInput);
  setTextInput('');
}
```

By calling the ""setTextInput('')"" after adding the new hog, you ensure that the input field is cleared for the next input.

With these changes, React will detect the state change of the ""hogList"" array and trigger a re-render, updating the UI with the newly added card.",0.8448904752731323,"javascript, reactjs, arrays, render",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The mistake you're making is that you're using a `map` directive to rewrite the `$host` variable, but you're not using the `map` directive to rewrite the `$real_scheme` variable.
In your current config, the `$host` variable is being rewritten based on the `map` directive, but the `$real_scheme` variable is still set to `'http'`. To fix this, you can add a separate `map` directive to rewrite the `$real_scheme` variable:

}

In this updated config, the `$real_scheme` variable is being rewritten to `'http'` using the `map` directive, and then the `if` statement checks if `$real_scheme` is still set to `'http'`. If it is, the redirection to HTTPS is performed.
Also, you don't need to use the `$nonwwwhost` variable, you can directly use the `$host` variable in the `return` statement:

","The problem with your current configuration is that it is not handling the redirection correctly. The `$host` variable in nginx includes the www prefix, so when you redirect from `http://example.com` to `https://www.example.com`, the www prefix is still present.

To achieve the desired redirect from `http://example.com` to `https://example.com`, you can modify your nginx configuration as follows:

```
map $http_host $non_www_host {
    default $http_host;
    ~^www\.(.*)$ $1;
}

server {
    listen 80;

}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    # SSL configuration...
    # Other server configuration...
}
```

In this configuration, we use the `$http_host` variable to capture the host name of the incoming request. The `map` block is used to remove the www prefix if it exists. Then, in the `server` block listening on port 80, we check if the scheme is HTTP and perform a redirect to `https://$non_www_host$request_uri`. This will redirect `http://example.com` to `https://example.com` while preserving the path and query parameters.

Note that you should have a separate `server` block listening on port 443 for HTTPS requests to handle the SSL configuration and other server-specific settings.

","  Sure, I can help you extract the financial data from the website using BeautifulSoup. The issue you're facing is that the data you want to extract is hidden within unordered lists and spans with no name attribute, which makes it difficult for BeautifulSoup to identify the data you want.
Here's a solution that you can try:
1. First, you can use the `find_all()` method of BeautifulSoup to find all the unordered lists (`ul` tags) within the `div` tag that contains the financial data. You can do this by using the following code:
```
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
lists = soup.find('div', {'class': 'finance_details_right'}).find_all('ul')
```
This will give you a list of all the unordered lists within the `div` tag.
2. Next, you can use the `find()` method of BeautifulSoup to find each unordered list and extract the data you want. For example, to extract the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value, you can use the following code:
```
for list in lists:

    # Find the first span element within the list
    span = list.find('span', {'class': 'text'})

    # Extract the text value of the span element
    value = span.text.strip()

    # Extract the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value
    if 'Κεφαλαιοποίηση' in value:
        # Use the float() function to convert the text to a float value
        value = float(value)
        # Print the extracted value
        print(f'Κεφαλαιοποίηση - {SCRIP}: {value} Cr')

```
This will print the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value for each unordered list within the `div` tag.
3. Finally, you can use the `break` statement to exit the loop as soon as you find the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value, like this:


for list in lists:


    # Find the first span element within the list
    span = list.find('span', {'class': 'text'})

    # Extract the text value of the span element
    value = span.text.strip()

    # Extract the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value
    if 'Κεφαλαιοποίηση' in value:
        # Use the float() function to convert the text to a float value
        value = float(value)
        # Print the extracted value
        print(f'Κεφαλαιοποίηση - {SCRIP}: {value} Cr')

    # Break out of the loop as soon as you find the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value
    break

This will only print the ""Κεφαλαιοποίηση"" value once, for the first unordered list that contains it.

","To fix the code and extract the desired financial data using Beautifulsoup, you can make the following modifications:

1. Update the class name in your code: The class name in the HTML code is ""finance__details__right"", but in your code, you are using ""finance_details_right"". Update the class name in the find() method to match the HTML code.

2. Modify the find_all() method: In the for loop, you are using an empty string as the argument for find(). Instead, you can use the find() method without any arguments to get the first span element within the li tag.

3. Extract the text from the span element: To extract the text from the span element, you can use .text after finding the span element.

4. Remove the euro sign: To remove the euro sign from the extracted data, you can use the replace() method to replace the euro sign with an empty string.

Here's the modified code:

2. Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the words in the ""Addressee"" column that match the condition (e.g. ""(Mrs.|Ms.|Miss)"" and the first word in the ""Addressee"" column).
import re
# Create a list of tuples for the conditions
conditions = [('Mrs.', 'First'), ('Ms.', 'First'), ('Miss', 'First')]
3. Use the apply() function to apply the list of tuples to each row in the ""Addressee"" column, and rearrange the words in the ""Addressee"" column based on the condition.
df['Rearrange'] = df['Addressee'].apply(lambda x: [y for y in x.split() if any(condition in y for condition in conditions)])

The code above will create a new column ""Rearrange"" with the rearranged words in the ""Addressee"" column based on the conditions in the list of tuples.
Note: The conditions in the list of tuples are regular expressions, you can adjust them to match your specific requirements.
Also, you can use the same approach to rearrange the words in the ""Addressee"" column based on multiple conditions by adding more tuples to the list of conditions.

","To rearrange the order of words in the Addressee column based on a condition, you can use the apply function in pandas. Here's the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np

# Read csv
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file, encoding='latin-1')

# Add column to keep track of what was changed. 
df['Rearrange'] = ''
df = df.replace(np.nan, '')
df.insert(0, 'ID', range(0, len(df)))

# Rearrange function
def rearrange_names(row):
    if row['Title'] in ['Mrs.', 'Ms.', 'Miss'] and row['FirstName'] in row['Addressee']:
        names = row['Addressee'].split()
        names[0], names[2] = names[2], names[0]
        return ' '.join(names)
    else:
        return row['Addressee']

# Apply the rearrange_names function to each row
df['Addressee'] = df.apply(rearrange_names, axis=1)

# If the row is rearranged, mark it as changed
df.loc[df['Addressee'] != df['Addressee'].shift()] = 1

# Count the number of rows changed
changed = df[df['Rearrange'] == 1]
unchanged = df[df['Rearrange'] != 1]

# Clean up
del changed[""ID""]
del unchanged[""ID""]

# Print results
print(""There was a total of"", df.shape[0], ""rows."")
print(""There were"", unchanged.shape[0], ""rows unchanged and"", changed.shape[0], ""rows rearranged."")
```

In this code, the `rearrange_names` function checks if the Title is one of ['Mrs.', 'Ms.', 'Miss'] and if the FirstName is present in the Addressee column. If the condition is met, it splits the Addressee into a list of words, swaps the positions of the first and third words, and then joins them back into a string.

The apply function is used to apply the `rearrange_names` function to each row in the dataframe, and the 'Addressee' column is updated with the rearranged names.

Finally, the code checks for rows where the 'Addressee' column has changed compared to the previous row and marks them as changed. The number of changed and unchanged rows are counted and printed as output.

Please note that in your original code, there were some inconsistencies in the variable names and indentation, which I have corrected in the modified code.",0.6343019604682922,"python, pandas, dataframe, split",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Since the list is of String objects and this class already implements the Comparator interface, the rest is easy: simply return the result of comparison of the compared strings.

[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]

If instead you pass &quot;foo&quot; as the key, the original list is printed out:

[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]

Just a clarifying note, the List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; has to be mutable since the contents of the list needs to be changed for sorting. However, since I did not intended to change any of the List&lt;String&gt;, I created those using List.of() to make them immutable. If you attempt to mutate these lists, an exception will be thrown.
","  To replace a column in a list of lists with a sorted version of the column, you can use the following approach:
1. Create a new list to hold the sorted column values.
```
List&lt;String&gt; sortedCol = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
```
2. Loop through the original list of lists and for each list, loop through the column values and add them to the sorted column list.
```
for (int i = 0; i &lt; dataArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; dataArray[i].length; j++) {
        sortedCol.add(dataArray[i][j]);
    }
}
```
3. Once you have the sorted column list, you can replace the original column in each list with the sorted list.
```
List&lt;String&gt; updatedList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

for (int i = 0; i &lt; dataArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; dataArray[i].length; j++) {
        dataArray[i][j] = sortedCol;
    }
}
```
4. Finally, you can return the updated list of lists.

```
return updatedList;
```

Here is the complete method:
```
public static List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; replaceCol (String [][] dataArray, List&lt;String&gt; col, int valType) {
    List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; updatedList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; dataArray.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; dataArray[i].length; j++) {
                if (dataArray[i][valType].equalsIgnoreCase(col.get(i))) {
                    dataArray[i][valType] = col.get(i);
                }
            }
        }
        updatedList = TwoDArrayToList(dataArray);

        return updatedList;
    }

```

In this method, we first create a new list to hold the sorted column values and then loop through the original list of lists to create the updated list.

Note: In the above method, I have assumed that the column index is passed as `valType` and the column value to be sorted is passed as `col`. You can modify this as per your requirement.
Also, I have used the `TwoDArrayToList` method to convert the 2d array to a list of lists. You can provide your own implementation of this method or use the one provided in the question.",0.4847619831562042,"java, list, sorting",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

        for (List&lt;String&gt; list : grid) {
            OptionalInt indexOpt = IntStream.range(0, list.size())
             .filter(i -&gt; key.equals(list.get(i)))
             .findFirst();
            if (indexOpt.isPresent()) {
                return indexOpt.getAsInt();
            }
        }
        return -1;

}

This prints out
Pivot Point: 2
[Test0, ABC, 123, A1]
[Test4, MNO, 234, A5]
[Test1, DEF, 345, A2]
[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]
[Test3, JKL, 901, A4]

If instead you pass &quot;foo&quot; as the key, the original list is printed out:
Pivot Point: -1
[Test0, ABC, 123, A1]
[Test3, JKL, 901, A4]
[Test1, DEF, 345, A2]
[Test4, MNO, 234, A5]
[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]

Just a clarifying note, the List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; has to be mutable since the contents of the list needs to be changed for sorting. However, since I did not intended to change any of the List&lt;String&gt;, I created those using List.of() to make them immutable. If you attempt to mutate these lists, an exception will be thrown.
","To fix the problem of removing or replacing a column from a list of lists in Java, you can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each row of the list.
2. Get the desired column from each row using the column index.
3. Store the values of the desired column in a separate list.
4. Sort the separate list.
5. Iterate through each row again and replace the values of the desired column with the sorted values from the separate list.
6. Finally, return the updated list.

Here's the modified version of your `replaceCol` method that implements the above steps:

```java
public static List<List<String>> replaceCol(String[][] dataArray, int columnIndex) {
    List<String> columnValues = new ArrayList<>();

    // Step 1: Get the desired column values
    for (String[] row : dataArray) {
        columnValues.add(row[columnIndex]);
    }

    // Step 2: Sort the column values
    Collections.sort(columnValues);

    // Step 3: Replace the column values in the original list
    for (int i = 0; i < dataArray.length; i++) {
        dataArray[i][columnIndex] = columnValues.get(i);
    }

    // Step 4: Convert the 2D array to a list of lists
    List<List<String>> updatedList = TwoDArrayToList(dataArray);

    return updatedList;
}
```

To use this method, you can pass your original 2D array and the index of the column you want to sort. For example, to sort the third column (index 2) in your example, you would call the method like this:

```java
List<List<String>> updatedList = replaceCol(dataArray, 2);
```

Now, the `updatedList` will contain the original list with the third column sorted. You can proceed with your binary search and printing the row(s) as per your requirement.",0.4857827126979828,"java, list, sorting",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Post ID values are visible to visitors to a WordPress site. (They show up in places like HTML element classes. Do View Source on a page showing posts and you'll see this.)
So if your reason for using an alternative ID is to avoid disclosing post ID values (maybe for security reasons) don't bother. They are already available.
Plus, if you use an alternative ID you'll probably need to store it as a post attribute in wp_postmeta in your database. That is, putting it mildly, not the best-performing part of WordPress.
","  As an expert in software engineering with experience in PHP, I would recommend using the WordPress REST API to fetch article IDs for your mobile app. This approach offers several advantages for security, scalability, and maintainability. Here's why:
1. Security:
Using the WordPress REST API to fetch article IDs provides a secure way to interact with the WordPress database. The API uses SSL/TLS encryption and authenticates requests through a secure token, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data. This is more secure than storing article IDs in your mobile app, which could potentially be exposed to unauthorized access.
2. Scalability:
Using the WordPress REST API allows you to scale your application more easily, as you can handle a large volume of requests without affecting the performance of your WordPress site. The API is optimized for speed and can handle multiple requests simultaneously, ensuring that your app can handle a significant number of users without downtime.
3. Maintainability:
Working with the WordPress REST API is more maintainable than managing a custom API for article IDs. The API is designed to be flexible and can adapt to changing requirements, making it easier to add new features, fix bugs, or modify your app's functionality. Additionally, the WordPress community maintains a large and active developer community, which can provide valuable resources and support when needed.
4. Customization:
The WordPress REST API provides a flexible and customizable solution for fetching article IDs. You can tailor the API to meet your app's specific needs, such as filtering or sorting articles based on customfields or taxonomies. This level of customization is more challenging when building a custom API from scratch.
That being said, there are some potential security concerns to consider when using the WordPress REST API:
1. Authorization:
To ensure that only authorized users can access the article IDs, you must implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. The WordPress REST API includes built-in authentication and authorization features, but you must configure them correctly to meet your app's requirements.
2. Data Encryption:
To protect the security of your app and the WordPress site, it's essential to encrypt the data transmitted between the app and the site. You can use HTTPS to encrypt the data and secure the communication channel.
3. Input Validation:
To prevent malicious attacks, it's crucial to validate user input and sanitize data. The WordPress REST API includes built-in input validation and sanitization mechanisms, but you must use them correctly to avoid vulnerabilities.
In conclusion, using the WordPress REST API to fetch article IDs for your mobile app is a secure, scalable, and maintainable solution. However, you must implement proper authorization, data encryption, and input validation mechanisms to ensure the security of your app and the WordPress site. With the right implementation, the WordPress REST API can be a powerful tool for fetching article IDs and enhancing the functionality of your mobile app.",0.43238288164138794,"php, wordpress, api",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Based on the given information, it is logical to get the WordPress article ID with the PHP API. However, it's important to consider security measures when exposing sensitive information through APIs.

In terms of security, using the WordPress article ID itself is not a security concern, as it is a unique identifier assigned by WordPress. However, you should ensure that the API endpoints are properly secured and authenticated to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Here are a few suggestions to enhance the security of your custom PHP API:

1. Implement authentication: Require authentication for accessing API endpoints. This can be done using API keys, OAuth, or other authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users have access.

2. Use secure communication: Ensure that the API is accessed over HTTPS to encrypt the data in transit and prevent eavesdropping or tampering.

3. Implement rate limiting: Prevent abuse of the API by implementing rate limiting to restrict the number of requests made within a certain time period by an IP address or user.

4. Validate and sanitize input: Validate and sanitize all input received from the API to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

5. Apply access controls: Limit the data returned by the API to only what is necessary for the mobile app. Avoid exposing sensitive information that is not required.

6. Keep the API up-to-date: Regularly update the API and dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility with the latest WordPress version.

By following these security measures, you can ensure that your custom PHP API is secure and reliable for retrieving WordPress article data.",0.4465930461883545,"php, wordpress, api",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The problem is that in your `$sum` aggregation pipeline, you are passing an array of strings instead of an array of numeric values. In MongoDB, the `$sum` aggregation operator expects the values passed to it to be numeric, so when it encounters an array of strings, it returns 0.
To fix this issue, you need to convert the array of strings to an array of numeric values before passing it to the `$sum` aggregation operator. You can do this by using the `toNumber()` method on the array of strings, like this:
`$sumPoints: **{$sum: [&quot;$lodging.reviews.cleanliness&quot;, &quot;lodging.reviews.location&quot;, &quot;lodging.reviews.food&quot;].map(function(value) { return parseFloat(value); })}**`
By calling the `map()` method on the array of strings and passing it a function that converts each string to a numeric value, we can convert the array of strings to an array of numeric values that can be passed to the `$sum` aggregation operator.
Alternatively, you can also use `toNumber()` method directly on the fields, like this:
`$sumPoints: **{$sum: [&quot;$lodging.reviews.cleanliness&quot;, &quot;lodging.reviews.location&quot;, &quot;lodging.reviews.food&quot;].map(Field.toNumber)}**`

","Based on the provided information, it seems like the issue lies with the data types of the fields you are trying to sum. The `$sum` operator in MongoDB works with numeric values, but if the fields `lodging.reviews.cleanliness`, `lodging.reviews.location`, and `lodging.reviews.food` are not stored as numeric values (e.g., they are stored as strings), the `$sum` operator will not work as expected and will return 0.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the fields `lodging.reviews.cleanliness`, `lodging.reviews.location`, and `lodging.reviews.food` are stored as numeric values in your MongoDB collection. You can do this by ensuring that the values are stored as numbers when inserting or updating documents.

For example, when inserting a document, instead of storing the values as strings:

```
db.test.insertOne({
  lodging: {
    reviews: {
      cleanliness: ""4"",
      location: ""5"",
      food: ""3""
    }
  }
});
```

Store them as numbers:

```
db.test.insertOne({
  lodging: {
    reviews: {
      cleanliness: 4,
      location: 5,
      food: 3
    }
  }
});
```

https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/upload-files#web-version-9
","  Thanks for sharing the problem you're facing with uploading an image to Firebase Storage using Vue.js. Based on the error message you provided (`storageRef.put is not a function`), it seems that you're using the old Firebase Storage SDK (version 9) in your Vue.js application.
As of Firebase SDK version 9, the `put()` method has been replaced by `save()` to upload a file to Firebase Storage. Here's an updated version of your `uploadImage()` function that should work with Firebase SDK version 9:
uploadImage(e) {
      const file = e.target.files[0];
      const storage = getStorage();
      const storageRef = storageReference(storage, 'products/' + file.name);
      storageRef.save(file).then((ref) => {
        // Handle success
      });

.

In this updated version, we're using the `save()` method instead of `put()`, and passing the file object as an argument to the `save()` method. The `save()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `FirebaseStorageReference` object, which you can use to handle the upload progress and success callbacks.
Here are some additional tips to help you troubleshoot the issue:
1. Make sure you're using the correct Firebase SDK version for your Vue.js application. You can check the version of the Firebase SDK by running `firebase --version` in your terminal.
2. Verify that you've correctly installed the Firebase SDK for Vue.js. You can install the Firebase SDK for Vue.js using npm by running `npm install @firebase/vue`
3. Ensure that you're using the correct path for storing the uploaded image in Firebase Storage. In your code, you're using a hardcoded path `/products/ + file.name`, but you may want to consider using a dynamic path based on the file name or other criteria to store the image in a more organized manner in Firebase Storage.
4. Check the file type and size of the image you're trying to upload. Firebase Storage has size and type restrictions for uploaded files, so make sure the file you're trying to upload meets these restrictions.
5. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to write to Firebase Storage. You may need to set up the appropriate permissions in the Firebase console or using the Firebase CLI.
By following these tips and adapting the updated code to your specific use case, you should be able to successfully upload an image to Firebase Storage using Vue.js.

","The error message ""storageRef.put is not a function"" typically occurs when there is an issue with the Firebase Storage setup or when the storage reference is not properly initialized. Here are a few steps you can take to fix this problem:

1. Make sure you have properly installed and imported the necessary Firebase modules in your Vue.js project. In this case, you should have imported `getStorage` and `storageReference` from the Firebase Storage package.

2. Verify that you have initialized Firebase in your project and have the correct configuration details. This typically involves creating a Firebase project, obtaining the Firebase configuration object, and initializing Firebase using `initializeApp`.

3. Double-check that you have the latest version of the Firebase SDK installed. Sometimes, using an outdated version can cause compatibility issues.

4. Confirm that you have the correct imports for Firebase Storage. In this case, you should be importing `getStorage` from the `firebase/storage` package and `storageReference` from `firebase/storage`.

   ```javascript
   import { getStorage, ref as storageReference, uploadBytes } from ""firebase/storage"";
   ```

5. Ensure that the `e.target.files[0]` value is returning the correct file object. You can add a console.log statement before the `storageRef.put(file)` line to check the value.

   ```javascript
   console.log(file);
   ```

6. Check if the `storage` object is properly initialized. You can add a console.log statement before the `const storageRef = storageReference(storage, 'products/' + file.name);` line to check if the `storage` object is correctly instantiated.

   ```javascript
   console.log(storage);
   ```

74227793,ImageSharp RecolorBrush not available anymore?,"I'm using ImageSharp version 2.1.3 in a .NET 6 project. Now the API which I can use seems to be different from what is shown in the official documentation. For instance the docs are pointing to a namespace SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing which is not part of the NuGet package I received.
One thing I cannot find is the RecolorBrush documented here. It allows me to replace a color with another one like this:
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing.Processing;

{
    var brush = new RecolorBrush(Color.White, Color.Transparent, 0.2F);
    image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx.Fill(brush));
    image.Save('transparent.png');
}

Several things are now not working:

RecolorBrush is not a thing in my Nuget.
ctx.Fill seems to be no longer available.

So am I missing a package, is this a breaking change and if yes what is the new way to do it and where can I find some official info on this?
",,"  It seems that the RecolorBrush class in ImageSharp has been deprecated in version 2.1.3 and is no longer available in the latest versions of the library.
The reason for this change is that the original RecolorBrush implementation was not thread-safe, which led to issues when used in parallel processing scenarios. To resolve this issue, the developers of ImageSharp have introduced a new, thread-safe replacement for RecolorBrush called `ColorAdjustmentBrush`.
Here's an example of how to use the new `ColorAdjustmentBrush` in ImageSharp version 2.1.3 and later:
```csharp
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing.Processing;

using (var image = Image.Load('file.png'))
{
    var brush = new ColorAdjustmentBrush(Color.White, Color.Transparent, 0.2F);
    image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx.Fill(brush));
    image.Save('transparent.png');
}
```
In this example, we're using the same `ColorAdjustmentBrush` constructor as before to create a new brush with a fill color of `Color.White` and an opaque background color of `Color.Transparent`. The `Amount` parameter is set to `0.2F` to adjust the color intensity.
Note that the ` ctx.Fill` method has also been replaced with `ctx.Draw` in the latest version of ImageSharp. This method is used to apply the brush to the image, and it takes a `Brush` object as its parameter, which is what we're providing in this case.
For more information on using `ColorAdjustmentBrush` and other changes in ImageSharp version 2.1.3, you can refer to the migration guide available on the ImageSharp GitHub repository.
Also, it's worth noting that the official ImageSharp documentation has been renewed and improved in version 2.1.3, so you can find more detailed information on the new features and changes in the library there.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",-0.005176821257919073,"c#, .net-6.0, imagesharp",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

",,"It seems that you are facing some issues with the ImageSharp library in your .NET 6 project. It's possible that there have been some changes or updates in the library that have caused the discrepancies you are experiencing.

First, it's important to note that the ImageSharp library has undergone some changes in recent versions. As of version 2.x, the library has been split into multiple packages, including `SixLabors.ImageSharp`, `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing`, and `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing`. This might be the reason why you cannot find the `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing` namespace in the NuGet package you received.

Regarding the missing `RecolorBrush` and `ctx.Fill` methods, it's possible that these features have been deprecated or removed in the version of ImageSharp you are using. It's important to check the official documentation or release notes of the specific version you are using to understand the changes and any corresponding replacements.

To address your specific requirements, such as replacing a color with another one, you may need to explore alternative approaches or use other ImageSharp APIs. One option could be to use the `ImageSharp.Processing` namespace, which provides various image processing operations. You can explore the available methods and classes within this namespace to achieve your desired functionality.

To find official information about the changes and new features in ImageSharp, it's recommended to refer to the official documentation, GitHub repository, or any official communication channels related to the library. These sources should provide you with up-to-date information on the changes, breaking changes, and alternative approaches to achieve specific tasks.

In summary, it's important to check the specific version of ImageSharp you are using, review the official documentation, and explore alternative APIs within the library to accomplish your image processing requirements.",-0.009558804333209991,"c#, .net-6.0, imagesharp",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Thank you for providing the code and the problem you are facing. To check if two points are within a certain radius of each other, you can use the `distance` function in Python, which calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. Here's how you can modify your code to check if two points are within a certain radius:
1. Import the `distance` function from the `math` module:
```python
import math
```
2. Change the `randomStars` function to check if the distance between the two points is within a certain radius:
```python
def randomStars(y, num):

In the code above, you can adjust `YOUR_RADIUS` to the desired value for the minimum distance between the stars. The `distance()` function calculates the distance between two points using the distance formula. The code then checks if the distance between the new point and any existing point is less than the specified radius. If so, it generates a new random point until a suitable point is found.

Please note that you will need to implement the `starLocationY()` and `starLocationX()` functions according to your requirements for generating the Y and X coordinates of the stars.",0.8789211511611938,"python, random, turtle-graphics, python-turtle",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Which suggest to me that something is not quite right with the vtable for RafkoAgent. The actual segfault is thrown when it tries to access its virtual function, and instead of solve, gdb seem to step into get_step_names, which is at the end of RafkoAgent's displayed vtable.
An additional detail is that the whole project is a static library + tests. When I run the same code inside the CMake project of the library ( i.e.: where RafkoAgent and SolutionSolver is) the segfault does not occur.

","The root cause of the problem was that there were compilation macros used in the exported header files.
The main hint for this was that in the same repository it worked flawlessly, but it failed by the exported library.
The faulty structure was as follows:
class A {};

class B 
#if(compile_time_macro)
: public A
#endif

So essentially the library object was built as if the inheritance was included, but since the exported headers did not contain the macro definition, the inheritance was not present there.
This resulted in a very hardly traceable problem.
Whenever you use macros BEWARE.
","  The issue you're experiencing is related to the way C++ handles virtual functions and vtables. Here are some key points to help you understand what's happening and how to fix the issue:
1. Virtual functions in a base class:
When a class has a virtual function, the vtable contains a pointer to the function's definition. The vtable is generated based on the class hierarchy, which means that the vtable of a base class contains pointers to the virtual functions of its derived classes. In your case, `RafkoAgent` is a base class, and `SolutionSolver` is a derived class.
2. No virtual functions in `RafkoAgent`:
The `vtable` for `RafkoAgent` does not contain any pointers to virtual functions. This is because `RafkoAgent` does not have any virtual functions. The `solve` function is not declared as virtual, which means that it is not a virtual function.
3. Different vtables for derived classes:
When a derived class is created, its vtable is generated based on the virtual functions declared in its base classes. In your case, the vtable of `SolutionSolver` is generated based on the virtual functions of `RafkoAgent`. This means that `SolutionSolver` has its own vtable that contains pointers to the virtual functions of `RafkoAgent`.
4. Segmentation fault:
When you call the `solve` function on an instance of `SolutionSolver`, the program tries to access the vtable of `RafkoAgent` to find the address of the `solve` function. However, the vtable of `SolutionSolver` contains a different address for the `solve` function, which is why you're experiencing a segmentation fault.
To fix the issue, you have two options:
Option 1: Declare the `solve` function as virtual in `RafkoAgent`:
By declaring the `solve` function as virtual in `RafkoAgent`, the vtable of `RafkoAgent` will contain pointers to the virtual functions of both `RafkoAgent` and `SolutionSolver`. This means that the vtable of `SolutionSolver` will inherit the virtual functions of `RafkoAgent`, and the program will be able to access the `solve` function correctly.
Option 2: Use a pointer to the virtual function:
Alternatively, you can use a pointer to the virtual function to call the `solve` function on an instance of `SolutionSolver`. Here's an example:
```c++
 RafkoAgent* solver = new SolutionSolver(); // create an instance of SolutionSolver
 // call the solve function using a pointer to the virtual function
double result = solver->*solve(in);
delete solver;
```
In this example, we create an instance of `SolutionSolver` and use a pointer to the virtual function `solve` to call the function on the instance. The `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer and call the virtual function.
Conclusion:
In summary, the issue you're experiencing is caused by the fact that the vtable of a base class does not contain pointers to its own virtual functions. By declaring the `solve` function as virtual in `RafkoAgent` or using a pointer to the virtual function, you can fix the issue and ensure that the program works correctly. Always keep in mind the hierarchy of classes and the generation of vtables when working with virtual functions in C++.",0.3757379949092865,"c++, c++17, static-libraries, virtual-functions, vtable",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Which suggest to me that something is not quite right with the vtable for RafkoAgent. The actual segfault is thrown when it tries to access its virtual function, and instead of solve, gdb seem to step into get_step_names, which is at the end of RafkoAgent's displayed vtable.
An additional detail is that the whole project is a static library + tests. When I run the same code inside the CMake project of the library ( i.e.: where RafkoAgent and SolutionSolver is) the segfault does not occur. It does occur however in the linked example file, where I link the classes from a generated static library file (librafko.a)
The focus of the question is:
Is it by design for a base class to not contain its defined virtual functions in its own vtable, only the derived class? even if the derived class does not introduce additional virtual functions?

Whenever you use macros BEWARE.
","The issue you are facing seems to be related to the vtable not being properly generated for the base class `RafkoAgent`. In C++, each class with at least one virtual function has its own vtable, which contains pointers to the virtual functions. The derived class `SolutionSolver` should have a vtable that includes the virtual function `solve`, but the base class `RafkoAgent` should also have its own vtable that includes the same virtual function.

Based on the information you provided, it seems like the vtable for `RafkoAgent` is not being generated properly or is not being linked correctly. This could be due to various reasons, such as incorrect compiler flags or missing definitions.

To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the compilation flags: Ensure that you are compiling with the appropriate flags for C++ and that the necessary optimizations for generating vtables are enabled. For example, in GCC, you can use the `-std=c++17` flag to enable C++17 features.

2. Check the linking process: Verify that the object files for both `RafkoAgent` and `SolutionSolver` are being linked correctly. Make sure that the static library `librafko.a` is being linked with the correct object files.

3. Check for missing definitions: Ensure that all the necessary definitions for the virtual functions are present. Check that the declaration and definition of the `solve` function in the `SolutionSolver` class match exactly.

4. Enable debugging symbols: Make sure that debugging symbols are enabled during compilation and linking. This will provide more detailed information during debugging.

5. Use a debugger: Debuggers like GDB can provide valuable insights into the runtime behavior of your program. Set breakpoints at relevant locations, such as the point where the segfault occurs, and step through the code to understand the flow of execution and identify any potential issues.

Regarding your question about the design of vtables, it is by design for each class with at least one virtual function to have its own vtable, even if it doesn't introduce any additional virtual functions compared to its base class. Each class's vtable contains pointers to its own virtual functions, including those inherited from the base class.

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To replace the values in a DataFrame column with values from a List, you can use the `loc` method and the `replace` method in pandas.
Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
```
# assume we have a DataFrame called df

# create a list of replacement values
replacement_values = [12, 20, 03, 14, 04, 19]
# loop through each row in the DataFrame
# use the loc method to select the row and the column you want to replace
# use the replace method to replace the old value with the new value
df.loc[df['UpdatedDate'] != Empty_Str, 'UpdatedDate'] = replacement_values

```

In this example, `Empty_Str` is a string that represents the value you want to check for emptiness. If the value in the `UpdatedDate` column is not equal to `Empty_Str`, then the replacement will occur.
You can also use `isna` instead of `!=` to check for missing values
```


df.loc[df['UpdatedDate'].isna(), 'UpdatedDate'] = replacement_values

```

This will replace all the values in the `UpdatedDate` column that are missing (na) with the values in the `replacement_values` list.
You can also use `.mask` method instead of `.loc` and `.replace` methods, it helps to avoid manipulating the dataframe index.
```


df.mask(df['UpdatedDate'] == Empty_Str, replacement_values)

```


It's important to note that `loc` and `mask` methods will modify the DataFrame, so be sure to use them with caution and make a backup of your DataFrame before modifying it.

df['Date'] = df.apply(lambda row: updated_dates[row['ID']-1] if updated_dates[row['ID']-1] != '' else row['Date'], axis=1)

# Print the updated DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code uses the `apply()` function to iterate over each row of the DataFrame. It checks if the corresponding value in the `updated_dates` list is not an empty string. If it is not empty, it replaces the value in the `Date` column with the value from the list. Otherwise, it keeps the original value from the DataFrame.

73867414,Correct way to get a gRPC client to communicate with one of many ECS instances of the gRPC service?,"I have a gRPC client, not dockerised, and server application, which I want to dockerise.
What I don't understand is that gRPC first creates a connection with a server, which involves a handshake. So, if I want to deploy the dockerised server on ECS with multiple instances, then how will the client switch from one to the other (e.g., if one gRPC server falls over).
I know AWS loadbalancer now works with HTTP 2, but I can't find information on how to handle the fact that the server might change after the client has already opened a connection to another one.
What is involved?
","You don't necessarily need an in-line load balancer for this. By using a Round Robin client-side load balancing policy along with a DNS record that points to multiple backend instances, you should be able to get some level of redundancy.
","  To fix the problem of a gRPC client communicating with multiple gRPC servers on Amazon ECS, you have a few options:
 Option 1: Use load balancing with gRPC load balancing.
To use load balancing with gRPC, you can configure your load balancer to direct traffic to different gRPC servers based on the load balancing method you choose. For example, you can use Round Robin, IP Hash, or Least Connection to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Here are the steps to use load balancing with gRPC:
1. Create an Amazon ECS cluster and deploy your server application to it.
2. Configure your load balancer to direct traffic to the ECS cluster. You can do this by specifying the ECS cluster's DNS name or IP address in the load balancer's configuration.
3. In your gRPC client, set the load balancer's DNS name or IP address as the server address. Your client will then use the load balancer to direct traffic to the appropriate gRPC server.
 Option 2: Use gRPC session persistence.

To use gRPC session persistence, you can configure your gRPC client to store the session ID of the last gRPC server it communicated with and reuse it for future communications. This ensures that the client will always communicate with the same gRPC server, even if the server changes due to load balancing.
Here are the steps to use gRPC session persistence:
1. In your gRPC client, use the `grpc.WriteRequest` method to write the session ID of the last gRPC server to a configurable location, such as a file or a registry.
2. When the client needs to communicate with the gRPC server again, use the `grpc.ReadRequest` method to read the session ID from the configurable location and pass it to the gRPC server.
3. The gRPC server will then use the session ID to identify the client and continue the communication.
 Option 3: Use a gRPC session management library.
There are several libraries available that provide session management for gRPC, such as the `grpc-session` library. These libraries allow you to manage gRPC sessions across multiple servers and provide features such as session persistence and load balancing.
 Here are the steps to use a gRPC session management library:
1. Install the `grpc-session` library in your gRPC client and server applications.
2. Configure the `grpc-session` library to use the load balancer's DNS name or IP address to direct traffic to the appropriate gRPC server.
3. In your gRPC client, use the `grpc-session` library's `WriteRequest` method to write the session ID of the last gRPC server to a configurable location, such as a file or a registry.
4. When the client needs to communicate with the gRPC server again, use the `grpc-session` library's `ReadRequest` method to read the session ID from the configurable location and pass it to the gRPC server.
5. The gRPC server will then use the session ID to identify the client and continue the communication.
Conclusion:
 Using load balancing or gRPC session persistence can help ensure that a gRPC client communicates with the correct gRPC server, even if the server changes due to load balancing. Using a gRPC session management library can also simplify the process and provide additional features such as session persistence and load balancing.",0.506936252117157,"grpc, amazon-ecs",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To handle the scenario where the gRPC server instances may change in an ECS cluster, you can utilize an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) along with service discovery. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

1. Containerize the gRPC server application: Dockerize your gRPC server application by creating a Docker image that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

2. Deploy the Dockerized server application on ECS: Use the ECS service to deploy your Dockerized gRPC server application. Configure the service to run multiple instances of the server across the ECS cluster.

3. Set up an ALB: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS and configure it to listen on the desired port(s) for incoming gRPC traffic.

4. Configure target groups: Create target groups within the ALB and register the ECS instances running the gRPC server with these target groups. The ALB will distribute incoming traffic across these target groups.

5. Enable service discovery: Enable service discovery for the ECS service running the gRPC server. This allows the service to register itself with a service registry, making it discoverable by other services.

6. Update the gRPC client configuration: In the gRPC client code, instead of specifying a fixed IP or hostname for the server, use the ALB endpoint as the target. The ALB will handle the load balancing and routing of requests to the available gRPC server instances.

7. Implement client-side load balancing: To handle server failures or changes, you can implement client-side load balancing in your gRPC client. This can be achieved using libraries like gRPC-Go's built-in load balancing features or external libraries like gRPC-Go's resolver and balancer APIs.

With this setup, the gRPC client will communicate with the ALB, which will distribute the requests across the available gRPC server instances. If a server instance becomes unavailable, the ALB will automatically route the traffic to the remaining healthy instances.

By combining ECS, ALB, and service discovery, you can achieve a scalable and resilient architecture for your gRPC service on AWS.",0.3818897008895874,"grpc, amazon-ecs",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","If you want something like Create New, you can do like this.
You need to add height and width in ImageBackground. You cannot use flex:1 as it wont work.

    &lt;/ImageBackground&gt;
    &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;

","  To add a background to an image in React Native, you can use the ` ImageBackground` component. It takes the `source` prop as the URL of the image you want to display, and the `style` prop to define the background properties.
In your case, you want to add a black square to the image with white background. You can do this by creating a new style for the `ImageBackground` component and defining the `backgroundColor` property to be black.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to add a black background to the image:
```javascript
function Test1(props) {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <View style={styles.container2}>
            <ImageBackground source={require('../assets/plus.jpeg')} resizeMode=""cover"" style={styles.image4} backgroundColor=""#000000c0"">
                <Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image3.jpg' }} style={styles.image} />
            </ImageBackground>
            </View>
        </View>

    );
}
```
In this example, I've added a new style called `image4` that defines the background color to be black: `backgroundColor=""#000000c0""`. I've also added the `ImageBackground` component to the image element, passing the `source` prop as the URL of the image you want to display, and the `style` prop to define the background properties.
By doing this, the image will have a black background, and the white image will stand out more.
You can also change the `backgroundColor` property to any other color you want, or add other properties to the `ImageBackground` style to adjust the background image's size, offset, and other properties.",0.4357779026031494,react-native,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

});
```

I used the `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject` to make it cover the entire space of the `ImageBackground`. I also set the `backgroundColor` to black and `opacity` to 0.5 to create a semi-transparent overlay.

The child widget is supposed to display those points with CustomPainter.
For now, I just passed my variable transforms as an argument to the child widget.
The problem is, I want to add an element to my vector each time we pressed the floatingActionButton, which is written in my parent widget ; and when I click on it, it does not appear on the screen (the child doesn't get the information).
So how to make widgets communicate?
","The answer is pretty simple.
The way for a widget to inherit informations from another, is to used the f/widget function and the :inherit keyword. Example:
(f/widget
:inherit [m/Theme]
)

In order to inherit from the Theme widget and its internal state data.
But that is not it, in the parent widget you want to make your data available/sharable, you have to define your data in the :bind map.
Example:
(def child
  (f/widget
    :inherit [:transforms]
;; don't forget to dereference it when you want to use it
;; (dart:core/print @transforms)
...))

(def parent
  (f/widget
    :bind {:transforms [(m/Offset 0 0) (m/Offset 1 0)]}
...))


","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this issue! It sounds like you're trying to pass data from a parent widget to a child widget using the `Clojure` and `Dart` frameworks. Here's a possible solution:
1. In your parent widget, define a variable `transforms` of type `Vector` of `Offset`.
```clojure
(def transforms [])
(defn update-transforms []
  (set! transforms (conj transforms (Offset. 10.0 20.0)))
flutter.dart:38:54  Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke interface org.dartlang.dependencies.DepsGenerator$closure1 com.dart/dart/sdk/dart.dart:100
But when I click on the floating action button, it doesn't update the transforms in the child widget. Here's the widget tree:
```
```
```
I think the problem is that the child widget doesn't have access to the `transforms` variable defined in the parent widget. One possible solution is to use a callback function to pass the data from the parent to the child. Here's an example of how you could do this:
1. In your parent widget, define a callback function:
```
(declare-function *update-transforms* (transforms)
```
@keyframes anim {
  0%  Transform scale(1)
   100%  Transform scale(2)
   200%  Transform scale(1)
   300%  Transform scale(0.5) 
   400%  Transform scale(1) easing(easeOut)
}(def transforms [])

```
Then, in your child widget, you can define a reference to the callback function and call it whenever the floating action button is pressed:
```
(defn on-fab-pressed []
  (apply-update-transforms *update-transforms*)
```
In your child widget, you can also define a method to handle the data passed from the parent widget:
```
(defn handle-update-transforms []
  (set! transforms (apply-transforms *transforms*)))
```
Then, when the floating action button is pressed, you can call the `handle-update-transforms` method in your child widget to update the `transforms` variable:
```
(on-fab-pressed)
```
This way, the child widget has access to the `transforms` variable defined in the parent widget, and can update it whenever necessary.

...))


","To make widgets communicate in Flutter, you can use the concept of callbacks and state management. In this case, you can use a callback function to pass data from the child widget to the parent widget.

Here's how you can fix the problem:

1. In your parent widget, define a function that will handle the addition of elements to the `transforms` vector. Let's call it `addTransform`.

```dart
void addTransform(Offset newTransform) {
  setState(() {
    transforms.add(newTransform);
  });
}
```

2. Pass the `addTransform` function as a callback to the child widget.

```dart
ChildWidget(callback: addTransform)
```

3. In your child widget, define a callback function that will be triggered when the floatingActionButton is pressed. Let's call it `onFloatingActionButtonPressed`.

```dart
class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final Function(Offset) callback;

  ChildWidget({required this.callback});

  void onFloatingActionButtonPressed() {
    // Add the new transform by calling the callback function
    callback(Offset(0.0, 0.0));
  }

  // Rest of your child widget code
}
```

4. In the child widget, use the `onPressed` property of the `floatingActionButton` to call the `onFloatingActionButtonPressed` function.

```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: onFloatingActionButtonPressed,
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
),
```

Now, when you press the floatingActionButton in the child widget, it will trigger the `onFloatingActionButtonPressed` function, which in turn calls the `addTransform` function in the parent widget, adding a new element to the `transforms` vector. Since the `transforms` vector is updated, the parent widget will be rebuilt, and the updated data will be passed to the child widget for rendering.

This way, the child widget will have access to the updated data and display the new points accordingly.",0.7211134433746338,"flutter, clojure",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The problem you're facing is likely due to the fact that you're adding the `listeners` to the `navItems` element, but you're only targeting the `a` elements inside the `li` elements. Since the `a` elements are descendants of the `li` elements, they don't have their own event listeners.

1. Add the event listener to the `li` elements directly, like this:
```
menu.addEventListener(""click"", () => {

","The issue in your code is that you're trying to add an event listener to multiple elements using `getElementsByClassName`, which returns a collection of elements. However, `addEventListener` can only be used on a single element at a time.

To fix this, you need to loop through the `navItems` collection and add the event listener to each individual element. Here's the modified code:

```javascript
const navigation = document.getElementById(""nv"");
const menu = document.getElementById(""mn"");
const navItems = document.getElementsByClassName(""nvItem"");

menu.addEventListener(""click"", () => {

  navigation.classList.toggle(""active"");
  menu.classList.toggle(""active"");
  console.log(""---Active---"");
});

// Loop through navItems and add event listener to each element
for (let i = 0; i < navItems.length; i++) {

73635965,How do I return a value from a function triggered by Timer,"I have created a timer to trigger the function timerFire, every 5 seconds accepting the Double howHungry from another swift file.
The timer takes the value of howHungry and reduces it by 1 every time the timer fires and returns the new value.

        hungryDouble -= 1.0
        print(&quot;Hunger value is \(hungryDouble)&quot;)

}

","You can add a callback inside file2.swift

let hungerTimer = myTimer()
hungerTimer.startTimer(timerInitialValue: howHungry)
hungerTimer.callback = { [weak self] res in
   print(res)
} 

","  To fix the issue, you can use a variable to store the return value of the `timerFire` function, and then use that variable to update the `howHungry` value in the main file. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve this:
In `file2.swift`:
```swift
    func startTimer(timerInitialValue: Double) {
        // Create a variable to store the return value of timerFire
        var newHungryDouble = timerInitialValue
        if timer == nil {
            // Create a new timer for hunger if one doesn't exist
            timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 2, target: self, selector: #selector(timerFire(sender:)), userInfo: timerInitialValue, repeats: true)
            print(""New Timer Started"")
        } else {
            // If a timer does exist, end it and start a new one
            timer!.invalidate()
            timer = nil
            print(""Old Timer Stopped"")
            newHungryDouble = timerFire(sender: timer)
            print(""New Hunger Value: \(newHungryDouble)"")
            // Update the howHungry value in the main file with the new value
            let hunger = Hunger(howHungry: newHungryDouble)
            // ...
        }
    }

    @objc func timerFire(sender: Timer) -> Double {
        // Get hungerDouble value from Timer
        var hungryDouble = sender.userInfo as! Double

        // Reduce it by 1
        hungryDouble -= 1.0

        // Update the newHungryDouble variable with the reduced value
        newHungryDouble = hungryDouble

        print(""Hunger value is \(hungryDouble)"")

        return newHungryDouble

}
```
In `file1.swift`, you can update the `howHungry` value to use the new `newHungryDouble` variable:
```swift
    let hunger = Hunger(howHungry: 14.0)
    // ...

   hunger.howHungry = newHungryDouble // Update the how Hungry value with the new value from the timer

```
By using a variable to store the return value of the `timerFire` function, you can avoid sending the same value every time the timer fires, and instead, each time the timer fires, it will return a new value based on the reduction of the `hungryDouble` variable.
Also, in file2.swift, you can use the `newHungryDouble` variable to update the `howHungry` value in the main file, instead of directly updating the `howHungry` value in the timer function.",0.7932851314544678,swift,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To fix the issue and return the updated value of `howHungry` from the function triggered by the timer, you can make use of a delegate or a closure. Here's how you can implement it:

1. Define a protocol in `file2.swift` to create a delegate:

```swift
protocol TimerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func timerDidFire(with newValue: Double)
}
```

2. Add a delegate property to `myTimer` class in `file2.swift`:

```swift
class myTimer {
    weak var delegate: TimerDelegate?
    
    // Rest of the code...
}
```

3. Modify the `timerFire` function in `file2.swift` to call the delegate method:

```swift
@objc func timerFire(sender: Timer) {
    var hungryDouble = sender.userInfo as! Double
    hungryDouble -= 1.0
    print(""Hunger value is \(hungryDouble)"")
    delegate?.timerDidFire(with: hungryDouble)
}
```

4. Conform to the `TimerDelegate` protocol in `file1.swift`:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, TimerDelegate {
    // Rest of the code...
}
```

5. Implement the `timerDidFire` method in `file1.swift` to receive the updated value:

```swift
func timerDidFire(with newValue: Double) {
    // Use the updated value here
    print(""Received updated hunger value: \(newValue)"")
}
```

6. Set the delegate in `file1.swift` when creating the timer:

```swift
hungerTimer.delegate = self
```

With these changes, the `timerDidFire` method in `file1.swift` will be called every time the timer fires, and you can retrieve the updated value of `howHungry` there.",0.828054666519165,swift,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Sure, I can help you with that! It looks like you're trying to extract the parent key and child keys from an array of key-value pairs, where the keys are in the format ""pentrose_50_rafhan_c_<key>"". You want to split the keys into two parts, the parent key and the child key, using the ""_c_"" separator.
Here's one way you can do this in PHP:
```php
$result = array_combine($result, $filterred_chemical_keys);
// Loop through the array
foreach ($result as $key => $value) {
    // Split the key into parent and child parts
    $parent_key = explode('_c_', $key, 2);
    $child_keys = explode('_', $parent_key[1]);
    // Update the array with the new structure
    $result[$parent_key[0]] = $parent_key[1] = [];
    foreach ($child_keys as $child_key => $child_value) {
        $result[$parent_key[0]][$child_key] = $child_value;
    }
}

echo var_dump($result);
```
In this code, we first use `array_combine` to merge the original array with the result of the `explode` function applied to the keys. Then, we loop through the resulting array and use `explode` again to split the keys into parent and child parts. Finally, we update the array with the new structure, using the parent key as the parent and the child keys as children.
Note that in the `foreach` loop, we're using the `var_dump` function to display the resulting array after each iteration. This will give you a visual representation of how the array is structured after each transformation.

","To fix the issue and break the array into child arrays with the same key, you can modify your code as follows:

```php
$newArray = [];
foreach ($result as $key => $value) {
    $arr = explode('_', $key);
    $parentKey = implode('_', array_slice($arr, 0, 3)); // Get the parent key by joining the first three elements of the exploded array
    $childKey = implode('_', array_slice($arr, 3)); // Get the child key by joining the remaining elements of the exploded array
    
    if (!isset($newArray[$parentKey])) {
        $newArray[$parentKey] = [];
    }
    
    $newArray[$parentKey][$childKey] = $value;
}

dd($newArray);
```

This code will iterate through each key-value pair in the original array. It will explode the key using the underscore (_) delimiter and separate the parent key (first three elements) from the child key (remaining elements).

Then, it checks if the parent key already exists in the new array. If not, it creates an empty array for that parent key.

Finally, it assigns the value to the corresponding child key within the parent key's array.

After the loop, the `$newArray` will contain the desired structure where the parent keys are the main keys and each parent key has an associated array of child keys and their respective values.

","  The error message you're seeing is related to the `kubectl create` command not being able to parse the YAML files you're providing. The `create` argument is not a valid option for the `kubectl create` command, and you're likely trying to use it as a verb instead of a noun.
To fix this issue, you can use the `--filename` or `-f` option to specify the path to the YAML file you want to create, like this:
```
C:\Users\Administrator&gt;kubectl create -f <path_to_yaml_file>
```
For example, if you want to create the `postgresql-operator-dev4devs-com` deployment from the YAML file located at `C:\operatorhub-install\postgresql-operator-dev4devs-com.yaml`, you can use the following command:
```

C:\Users\Administrator&gt;kubectl create -f C:\operatorhub-install\postgresql-operator-dev4devs-com.yaml

```
Note that the `-f` option is used to specify the path to the YAML file, and the `create` option is not needed in this case.

Also, you can use `kubectl apply` command instead of `kubectl create` if you want to apply the yaml file as a blueprint for a deployment, service, or other kubernetes object.

","  Sure, I can help you with that! In Java 8, you can use the `stream()` method on a `Map` object to iterate over its keys and values. To get all keys whose values are null, you can use the `filter()` method to filter out the null values, and then collect the remaining keys into a list using `Collectors.toList()`. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:
```
    Map<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

        hashMap.put(""RED"", ""##FF0000"");

        hashMap.put(""BLACK"", null);

        hashMap.put(""BLUE"", ""##0000FF"");

        hashMap.put(""GREEN"", ""##008000"");


        // I want result like below - get All keys whose value is null
        List<String> collect = hashMap.values()
                .stream()
                .filter(e -> e == null)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println(collect);
        

        // Result - BLACK, WHITE in list
    }
```

In this modified code, we first iterate over the keys of the `Map` using the `values()` method, and then use the `stream()` method to iterate over the values. We then use the `filter()` method to filter out the values that are null, and collect the remaining keys into a list using `Collectors.toList()`. Finally, we print the list of null values using `System.out.println()`.
Note that the `filter()` method returns a `Stream` of the filtered values, so we use `Collectors.toList()` to convert it into a list of `String`s.

In the above code, the `entrySet()` method is used to get the key-value pairs as a `Set` of `Map.Entry` objects. Then, the `stream()` method is called on the `Set` to convert it into a stream. 

Next, the `filter()` method is used to filter out the entries whose values are null. The `map()` method is then used to extract only the keys from the filtered entries. Finally, the `collect()` method is used to collect the keys into a `List`.

","  Thank you for reaching out for help! Based on your description, it appears that you are trying to use Svelte actions to manipulate an HTML element with D3.js. It's great that you're exploring these technologies and learning how to use them together. However, there are a couple of things you might need to update in your code to make it work as expected.
Firstly, in your ` foo` function, you are creating a new `g` element and appending a `h1` element to it. However, this `g` element is not the same as the `g` element that was passed to the `foo` function as a parameter. To make sure that the `g` element is the correct one, you can use the `this` keyword to refer to the element that the `foo` function is called on. Here's an example:
```
function foo(node) {
        // the node has been mounted in the DOM
        const g = this.append('h1');
        g.text('This is the text I'd like to render to check that it works');
        return {
            destroy() {
                // the node has been removed from the DOM
            }
        };
    }
```
In this updated version of the `foo` function, `this` refers to the `node` object that the function is called on, which should be the correct `g` element.
Secondly, you might need to update the way you're importing D3.js in your code. It looks like you're trying to import it from the `svelte` package, but D3.js is not a part of Svelte. You can either import it separately using the following command:
```
import * as d3 from 'd3';
```
Or, you can use a package like `svelte-d3` which provides a simpler way to use D3.js in your Svelte components. Here's an example of how to import it using the `svelte-d3` package:
```
import { createApp } from 'svelte-d3';

const app = createApp();

```

","The error you are encountering is related to the missing export from the Svelte package. To fix this issue, you need to update your Svelte version to a version that includes the missing export.

Here are the steps to resolve the problem:

1. Open your project's package.json file.
2. Locate the ""svelte"" dependency and check its version.
3. Visit the official Svelte website or the npm registry to find the latest version of Svelte.
4. Update the ""svelte"" dependency in your package.json file to the latest version.
5. Save the changes to the package.json file.
6. Run the package manager command to update your project's dependencies. For example, if you are using npm, run ""npm install"" in your project's root directory.
7. Wait for the dependencies to be updated.
8. Once the update is finished, try running your project again.

","  The issue you're encountering is related to the way you're using the `cumulative` constraint in your model. The `cumulative` constraint can only handle integers as arguments, but in your case, you're trying to use a decimal value (i.e., `1`). This is causing the error message you see.
To fix this issue, you can modify the `cumulative` constraint to handle decimal values by using the `declare` directive to specify the data type of the argument:
```minizinc
% Declare variables and constraints
declare array[Tasks, Resources] of real resource_allocation; % Selection of resources per task
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_required[t])(resource_allocation[t,r] = 1);
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_forbidden[t])(resource_allocation[t,r] = 0);

% Mandatory & Forbidden constraint allocation
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_required[t])(resource_allocation[t,r] = 1);
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_forbidden[t])(resource_allocation[t,r] = 0);

% Constraint allocated to only one task at a time
constraint forall(t in Resources)(
    cumulative(start, duration, [resource_allocation[t, r] | t in Tasks], declare(int, start, resource_allocation[t, r]))
);
```
In this modified version of the model, I've added the `declare` directive to specify that the `start` and `resource_allocation` variables are of type `int`. This should allow the `cumulative` constraint to handle the decimal values correctly.
Another thing to note is that the `cumulative` constraint is not meant to handle tasks with resource assignments that are not monotonically increasing. In your case, the `start` variable is not monotonically increasing, as it can take on any value in the decision space. This means that the `cumulative` constraint will not be able to correctly enforce the constraint when the `start` variable is assigned to a task.
To handle this issue, you could modify the `cumulative` constraint to use a different aggregated function, such as `sum`, which can handle non-monotonically increasing values. For example:
```minizinc
% Modified cumulative constraint with sum aggregated function
% Constraint allocated to only one task at a time
constraint forall(t in Resources)(
    sum(start, duration, [resource_allocation[t, r] | t in Tasks]) <= 1;
);
```
In this modified version of the constraint, I've replaced the `cumulative` function with the `sum` aggregated function. This should allow the constraint to correctly handle tasks with non-monotonically increasing `start` variables.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",0.687777042388916,minizinc,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

array[Tasks, Resources] of var 0..1: resource_allocation; %Selection of resources per task.

To manage the required/forbidden resources, I used the following:
% Mandatory &amp; Forbidden constraint allocation
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_required[t])(resource_allocation[t,r]=1);
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_forbidden[t])(resource_allocation[t,r]=0);

resource_required being set of int storing the resources number that are required/forbidden.
Each resource represents 1 worker, and each worker can only perform one task at a time, so I am trying to state that, for every resources, the cumsum of allocation can at max be 1.
It might be important to note that start is also a decision variable.
 % Constraint allocated to only one task at a time
    constraint forall(t in Resources)(
        cumulative(start, duration, [resource_allocation[t, r] | t in Tasks], 1)
    );

Doing so, I always end up with the following error

","The error message you are encountering suggests that there is an issue with the cumulative constraint in your MiniZinc model. This error typically occurs when there is a problem with the input data provided to the cumulative constraint.

In your case, the error message specifically mentions an ""arithmetic operation on infinite value."" This indicates that there might be a problem with the values you are passing to the cumulative constraint.

To debug this issue, you can start by checking the values of the `start` and `duration` variables that you are passing to the cumulative constraint. Make sure that these variables are defined correctly and have appropriate values.

Additionally, you should verify that the `resource_allocation` array is correctly initialized and has the expected values. Ensure that the values of `resource_allocation[t, r]` are either 0 or 1, as expected.

If the issue persists, you can try simplifying your model and gradually adding complexity to identify the specific cause of the error. This can involve removing constraints or variables one by one until the error disappears, then gradually reintroducing them to identify the problematic part.

You can also try to isolate the problematic part of your model by creating a minimal working example that reproduces the error. This will help you focus on the specific issue and make it easier to identify and fix.

If you are still unable to resolve the issue, it might be helpful to seek assistance from the MiniZinc community or forums. They can provide more specific guidance and help you debug the problem based on the complete code and data.

Remember, the error message indicates that there is an issue with the input data or constraints provided to the cumulative constraint. By carefully examining your model and data, you should be able to identify and fix the problem.",0.5250146389007568,minizinc,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

All this depends on your requirement like if you want to know by which pipeline you are getting data you can use this.
","  Yes, I absolutely think it's important to include metainformation about the used ETL/ELT code (and version of the ELT code) in the produced sink files/tables. Here are some reasons why:
1. Tracking changes: By including the ETL/ELT version and pipeline ID in the sink files, you can easily track changes made to the pipelines and identify the source of any issues that may arise.
2. Lineage: Metainformation provides a lineage of data, which is important for ensuring data quality and regulatory compliance. By including the ETL/ELT version and pipeline ID, you can track the origin of the data and provide a clear audit trail.
3. Debugging: If there are any issues with the pipeline, including metainformation in the sink files can help you debug the problem more quickly. By knowing the version of the ELT code used and the pipeline ID, you can quickly identify the source of the issue and fix it more efficiently.

4. Versioning: By including the ETL/ELT version in the sink files, you can version your pipelines and track changes over time. This can help you maintain data lineage and ensure data quality.


5. Collaboration: By including metainformation in the sink files, you can make it easier for other team members to understand the pipeline and its components. This can help collaboration and debugging efforts, as well as ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to data sources and lineage.

In terms of how to add metainformation about the used ETL/ELT code (and version of the ELT code) to the produced sink files/tables, there are a few different approaches you can take:

Option 1: Manually add metadata to the sink files
You can manually add metadata to the sink files/tables using scripts or other tools. For example, you can use SQL queries to insert metadata into the sink tables, or use Python scripts to add attributes to the sink files. This can be a time-consuming process, but it gives you complete control over the metainformation you include.

Option 2: Use an ETL tool's built-in metadata features
Many ETL tools, such as Azure Data Factory, AWS Data Pipeline, or Talend, have built-in features for adding metainformation to sink files/tables. You can typically configure these features using a GUI or configuration file, and they will automatically add the appropriate metadata to the sink files/tables.

Option 3: Use data catalogs or data lineage tools
If you are working with a large number of pipelines, you may want to consider using a data catalog or data lineage tool to manage your metainformation. These tools can provide a central repository for storing and managing metadata, and can help you keep track of changes to your pipelines and data assets.

Overall, including metainformation about the used ETL/ELT code (and version of the ELT code) in the produced sink files/tables is a good idea for a number of reasons. By following one of the approaches outlined above, you can easily add this metainformation to your sink files/tables and ensure that your data is well-documented and traceable.",0.6960029602050781,"azure, azure-data-factory, etl, data-warehouse, data-lakehouse",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

All this depends on your requirement like if you want to know by which pipeline you are getting data you can use this.
","To add metainformation about the used ETL/ELT code and its version to the produced sink files/tables, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the metainformation: Determine the specific metainformation you want to include, such as PipelineID, DataProductionTime, or any other relevant information that helps identify the pipeline and its execution details.

2. Modify the ETL/ELT code: Within your ETL/ELT code, you need to add logic to capture and append the metainformation to the sink files/tables. This can be achieved by using variables or parameters to store the metainformation values and incorporating them into the output data.

3. Update the target schema: If you are storing the data in a data warehouse or data lakehouse, ensure that the target schema includes the necessary columns to accommodate the metainformation. Add new columns like PipelineID or DataProductionTime to the target schema.

4. Add the metainformation to the sink files/tables: During the ETL/ELT process, just before writing the data to the sink files/tables, include code to populate the metainformation columns with the appropriate values. This can be done by assigning the values from the variables or parameters created earlier.

5. Validate and test: Run the ETL/ELT pipeline and verify that the metainformation is correctly added to the sink files/tables. Check the target folder or tables to ensure that the metainformation columns contain the expected values.

Including metainformation like PipelineID or DataProductionTime in the target folder or tables is a good practice as it provides valuable context and helps track and manage the data produced by the pipeline. It allows for easy identification of which pipeline and version was responsible for generating the data, as well as when the data was produced.

By incorporating metainformation into the sink files/tables, you enhance data traceability and enable better data governance and management within your ETL/ELT pipelines.",0.835641086101532,"azure, azure-data-factory, etl, data-warehouse, data-lakehouse",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

How do I get Mapbox geocoding intersection search to work for non-US addresses?

Not that I can see.

Nothing in the docs indicates that this is not available world-wide, and I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't be.

Geocoders are built from lots of different data sources in different regions, with lots of different rules.
It's hard to imagine why Mapbox would deliberately introduce this limitation, but easy to imagine how it could unintentionally come to be. You may wish to contact them directly.
","  It looks like the Mapbox geocoding API does not support intersection search for non-US addresses. The API documentation you provided does not mention anything about country-specific limitations, but the example queries you provided all use US addresses.
When you try to query a non-US address, the API returns an empty response, as there are no intersections found. This is likely due to the fact that the API is designed primarily for US addresses, and the algorithm used for intersection search is not optimized for non-US locations.
As far as I can tell, there is no official documentation on this limitation, and it is not mentioned in the API documentation. However, it is possible that the API may support intersection search for non-US addresses in the future, as Mapbox continues to improve and expand its geocoding capabilities.
If you need to perform intersection search on non-US addresses, you may want to consider using a different geocoding service that supports global coverage and intersection search. There are several geocoding services available that offer this functionality, including:
1. OpenCage Geocoder: This service offers global coverage and supports intersection search, as well as other advanced features like geocode clustering and distance mapping.
2. Nominatim: This is an open-source geocoding service provided by the OpenStreetMap project. It supports intersection search and is available for users around the world.
3. HERE Maps Geocoding API: This service offers global coverage and supports intersection search, as well as other features like place search and reverse geocoding.
4. Google Maps Geocoding API: This service supports intersection search and is available for use by developers around the world.
It's worth noting that these services may have different pricing models and limitations, so be sure to check their documentation and pricing pages before selecting a service.
In summary, the Mapbox geocoding API does not support intersection search for non-US addresses, and there is no official documentation on this limitation.

","Based on the information provided, it seems that Mapbox geocoding API does not currently support intersection searches outside of the United States. This limitation is not explicitly documented in the API documentation, which can be misleading.

To confirm this limitation, you have already attempted various combinations of parameters such as country, proximity, and bbox, but none of them have returned the desired results for non-US addresses.

To address this issue, you can consider alternative approaches:

1. Use separate geocoding requests for each road: Instead of searching for intersections directly, you can perform individual geocoding requests for each road and then process the results to find the intersection point manually.

2. Utilize other geocoding services: If Mapbox's geocoding API does not meet your requirements for non-US intersections, you can explore other geocoding services such as Google Maps Geocoding API or OpenStreetMap Nominatim API, which may provide better support for international intersection searches.

3. Contact Mapbox support: If you want to confirm whether intersection searches are supported for non-US addresses or if there are any workarounds, it would be advisable to reach out to Mapbox support directly. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the capabilities and limitations of their geocoding API.

","  I see, it looks like you are trying to use the `request.security()` function in PineScript v5, but you are receiving errors related to the `expr` type and the `MA` variable. Here's why:
1. `MA` is a alias for the `ohlc` function, which returns a `float` series. Therefore, when you use `MA` in the `request.security()` function, it's expecting a `float` series as an argument, but you are providing a `float` variable.
2. When you try to pass a non-`float` series as an argument to `request.security()`, it will result in an error because the function is expecting a `float` series.
To fix the issue, you can either:
A. Change the `MA` variable to a `float` series before passing it to the `request.security()` function. For example:
```py
MA = nz(AMA[1]) + 0.5*(hlc3 - nz(MA[1]))
signal = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, MA.float())
```
B. Use the `request.security()` function with the `expr` argument set to the `float` series you want to pass. For example:
```py

signal = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, MAC.float())

```
By following either of these approaches, you should be able to avoid the ""undeclared identifier"" error and use the `request.security()` function in your PineScript v5 code.",0.744661808013916,pine-script,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

```pinescript
MA = float(nz(AMA[1]) + 0.5*(hlc3 - nz(MA[1])))

When the page is not scrolled, the sidebar meets the bottom of the page properly and content in the sidebar can still be scrolled all the way to the bottom.

","I solved it using interaction observer to detect when sticky is triggered and then removed the header height from the calc. Not a perfect solution, but gets the job done in my use case. A better solution would be nice.
","  Ah, I see! You want to keep the sidebar sticky at the bottom of the viewport when the page is scrolled, but you don't want to use absolute or fixed positioning, which can break the sidebar's flow inside the page.
To achieve this, you can use a combination of flexbox andMedia queries to make the sidebar sticky at the bottom of the viewport when the page is scrolled. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:
HTML:
```html
  <div class=""sidebar"">
    <div class=""sidebar-content"">Sidebar content</div>
  </div>
```
CSS:
```css

.sidebar {
  background: green;
  height: calc(100vh - 50px - 32px);
  position: sticky;
  top: 32px;
  margin-top: 32px;
}

.sidebar::after {
  content: """";
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 1px;
  background-color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .sidebar {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```
In this updated version, I've added a `::after` pseudo-element to the `.sidebar` element, which creates a red background block that sticks to the bottom of the viewport when the page is scrolled.
In the media query, I've set the position of the sidebar to absolute and set its bottom value to 0, which means it will stick to the bottom of the viewport when the screen is narrower than 600px.
You can adjust thevalues of `height` and `width` as needed to fit your design.

When the page is not scrolled, the sidebar meets the bottom of the page properly and content in the sidebar can still be scrolled all the way to the bottom.

However, once the page scrolls, the sidebar is off the bottom of the page by the size of the navbar + margin. This is expected, however, is there a way to ensure the sidebar sticks to the bottom of the viewport as well after scrolling the body?

Solutions that involve absolute or fixed positioning are not sufficient for me, as I'd like to keep the sidebar in the flow of the document.

","I solved it using interaction observer to detect when sticky is triggered and then removed the header height from the calc. Not a perfect solution, but gets the job done in my use case. A better solution would be nice.
","To fix the problem and ensure that the sidebar sticks to the bottom of the viewport after scrolling the body, you can make use of the CSS `position: sticky` property along with some modifications to your existing code.

Here's the updated code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html, body {
      height: 1200px;
      background: red;
      margin: 0;
    }

    header {
      height: 50px;
      background: blue;
    }

    .sidebar {
      background: green;
      height: calc(100vh - 50px - 32px);
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      bottom: 0;
      margin-top: 32px;
      width: 200px;
      overflow-y: scroll;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    header
  </header>

  <div class=""sidebar"">
    <!-- Sidebar content -->
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In the updated code, the following changes have been made:

1. Removed the `top: 32px;` property from the `.sidebar` class. This ensures that the sidebar starts sticking to the top of the viewport regardless of the scroll position.

2. Added the `bottom: 0;` property to the `.sidebar` class. This ensures that the sidebar sticks to the bottom of the viewport when scrolling down.

By making these changes, the sidebar will remain in the flow of the document and will stick to both the top and bottom of the viewport as desired.",0.39560285210609436,"html, css, position, sticky",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","There is some flaws if you use SimpleDateFormat.parse, that &quot;The method may not use the entire text of the given string&quot;. You can find that in javadoc DateFormat
I suggest you can use DateTimeFormatter &amp; LocalDate.parse instead.

        return false;
    }

","  The issue you are facing is related to the `SimpleDateFormat` class in your custom validator. The `SimpleDateFormat` class in Java has a problem with parsing dates in the format ""dd/MM/yyyy"" for years greater than 9999.
When you pass a date in the format ""02/12/2k22"" to the `SimpleDateFormat` constructor, it will interpret the ""12"" as the month, and the ""k"" as the day of the month (which is not a valid value). Therefore, the `SimpleDateFormat` will throw a `ParseException` when trying to parse this date.
To fix this issue, you have a few options:
1. Use a different date format: Instead of using the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format, you can use the ""yyyy-MM-dd"" format, which is more universal and will work for all dates, including years greater than 9999.
2. Use the `Date` class: Instead of using `SimpleDateFormat`, you can use the `Date` class to parse the date. The `Date` class does not have the same problem as `SimpleDateFormat` when it comes to parsing dates in the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format.
3. Parse the date in two steps: You can parse the date in two steps by first parsing the day and month, and then parsing the year. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String arg0, ConstraintValidatorContext arg1) {

        if (arg0 != null) {
            String[] parts = arg0.split(""/"");
            if (parts.length &gt; 1) {
                // Parse the day and month
                String day = parts[0];
                String month = parts[1];
                // Parse the year
                // You can use any date parsing method you like here, such as
                // DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy"");
                Date date = Date.parse(day + ""-"" + month, df);
                if (date != null) {
                    // Now you have a valid date object that you can use to validate the year
                    // ...

            }
        }
        return true;

    }
```

In this example, the date is first split into its component parts (day, month, and year), and then the year is parsed using the `Date.parse()` method. This method takes a String representation of the date in the format ""yyyy-MM-dd"" and parses it into a `Date` object.
4. Use a library like `DateTimeFormat` from the `org.jav immutable` package: This library provides a simple way to format and parse dates in a variety of formats, including ""dd/MM/yyyy"". It also handles internationalization and localization explicitly, so you don't have to worry about these issues.
Here's an example of how you can use the `DateTimeFormat` class to validate dates in the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format:
```
    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String arg0, ConstraintValidatorContext arg1) {

        if (arg0 != null) {
            DateTimeFormat df = DateTimeFormat.getDateTimeFormat(""dd/MM/yyyy"");
            try {
                DateTime date = df.parseDateTime(arg0);

                // Now you have a valid `DateTime` object that you can use to validate the year

            } catch (DateTimeFormatException e) {

                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;

    }
```


In this example, the `DateTimeFormat` class is used to parse the date in the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format, and the resulting `DateTime` object is then validated using the `isValid()` method.

","The problem you are facing is due to the format specified in the SimpleDateFormat. The ""yyyy"" format is not validating the year in the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format.

To fix this issue, you can modify the format pattern in the SimpleDateFormat to include the ""y"" character for the year in a single digit or a range of digits. Here's how you can update your code:

1. Change the format pattern in the SimpleDateFormat from ""dd/MM/yyyy"" to ""dd/MM/y{1,4}"".

```java
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""dd/MM/y{1,4}"");
```

This change allows the year to be validated with a single digit or a range of digits.

2. Update the isValid method in the IsValidDateFormatValidator class to handle the new format pattern.

```java
@Override
public boolean isValid(String arg0, ConstraintValidatorContext arg1) {
    if (arg0 != null) {
        if (arg0.trim().length() > 10) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!arg0.isEmpty()) {
            SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""dd/MM/y{1,4}"");
            sdf.setLenient(false);
            try {
                sdf.parse(arg0);
            } catch (ParseException e) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

With these changes, the year in the ""dd/MM/yyyy"" format will be properly validated.

Additionally, make sure that you have added the @Valid annotation to the method or class where you are using the dob field to trigger the validation.

You can also use `Alignment.leading` to align the icon to the left edge of the container, and `Alignment.trailing` to align it to the right edge.
Note that in the example above, I've also set the `margin` property of the `Container` widget to `EdgeInsets.only(left: 35.w)`, which is the amount of margin to add to the left edge of the container. You can adjust this value to achieve the desired alignment.

","To align the icon perfectly to the left edge of the blue container without any gap, you can make the following modifications to your code:

Here's the modified code snippet:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: SafeArea(
      left: false,
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Container(
            width: 50.w,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: IconButton(
              padding: EdgeInsets.zero, // Remove any padding around the icon
              iconSize: 25.w,
              onPressed: () {},
              icon: const FaIcon(FontAwesomeIcons.bars),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(

            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

With these modifications, the icon will be aligned perfectly to the left edge of the blue container without any gap. The red container will remain for reference, but it won't affect the alignment of the icon.",0.691243052482605,"flutter, dart, flutter-layout",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Yes, it is possible to achieve this using VBA in Excel. You can write a VBA macro to copy the row of fields and then paste them one by one into different fields in another application.

Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:

1. Open Excel and press Alt+F11 to open the VBA editor.
2. In the VBA editor, insert a new module by clicking on ""Insert"" > ""Module"".
3. In the module, write the following code:

```vba
Sub CopyAndPasteFields()
    Dim dataRange As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    
    ' Set the range of cells to copy
    Set dataRange = Range(""A1:J1"") ' Change the range as per your requirement
    
    ' Copy each cell one by one
    For Each cell In dataRange
        cell.Copy
        
        ' Switch to the other application where you want to paste the fields
        ' For example, if it's Notepad, you can use AppActivate ""Notepad""
        
        ' Paste the copied value
        SendKeys ""^v"" ' This will simulate pressing Ctrl+V to paste
        
        ' Move to the next field in the other application
        ' For example, if you want to move to the next field in Notepad, you can use SendKeys ""{TAB}""
    Next cell
End Sub
```

4. Save the VBA macro and close the editor.
5. Go back to your Excel sheet and run the macro by pressing Alt+F8, selecting ""CopyAndPasteFields"", and clicking ""Run"".

This VBA macro will copy each cell one by one and paste them into different fields in another application. You might need to modify the code according to the specific application you are working with, such as using the appropriate method to activate the other application and move to the next field.

Note: This approach relies on using SendKeys to simulate keystrokes, which can be a bit unreliable.

","  To set a custom InputFormat for the `DateTimePicker` component in Material-UI, you can use the `inputFormat` prop. This prop allows you to specify a function that returns a string in the format you want the user to input.
Here's an example of how you can set a custom InputFormat for the `DateTimePicker` component:
```
&lt;LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}&gt;

        maxDate={dayjs(endDate)}
    /&gt;
&lt;/LocalizationProvider&gt;

```
To set a custom InputFormat, you can create a function that takes the current date as an argument and returns a string in the format you want the user to input. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
const customInputFormat = (date) => {
    const year = date.getFullYear();
    const month = date.getMonth() + 1;
    const day = date.getDate();
    return `${day}${month}${year}`;
};

// Use the customInputFormat function to set the inputFormat prop
<DateTimePicker inputFormat={customInputFormat} ... >
```
This will set the customInputFormat prop to a function that takes the current date as an argument and returns a string in the format ""day month year"".
You can also use a library like `intl` to format the date in a different way, like this:
```
const customInputFormat = (date) => {
    return Intl.formatDate(date, { day: 'numeric', month: 'long', year: 'numeric' });
};
```
You can also use a library like `moment-format` to format the date in a different way, like this:
```
const customInputFormat = (date) => {
    return moment(date).format('DD MMM YYYY');
};
```
Keep in mind that the `inputFormat` prop is only used to format the date input field, and it will not affect the way the `DateTimePicker` component is displayed.
For example, if you want to display the date in the format ""DD MMM YYYY"" in the `DateTimePicker` component, you can use the `displayFormat` prop like this:
```

","  To create a GROUP ID variable in SAS, you can use the BY statement in a data step. The BY statement allows you to group observations by one or more variables, and perform operations on each group. In your case, you want to group observations by ID and SEQ, and assign a unique integer value to each group.
Here is an example of how you can do this:
data want;
  set have;
  if _n_=1 then id=_n_; * assign unique id to each observation *
  grpid= mod(id,seq); * calculate group id based on ID and SEQ *
  output id seq value grpid; * output the observations with the group id *
run;
In this code, the data step sets up an observation counter (`_n_) for each observation, and assigns a unique integer value to each observation (using the `id` variable). The `grpid` variable is then calculated by modulating the `id` and `seq` variables.
The `mod()` function takes two arguments: the first is the variable being modulated (in this case, `id` and `seq`), and the second is the modulus (which is 1 in this case, but you can adjust it to suit your needs). The `mod()` function returns the remainder of the division of the `id` or `seq` value by the modulus.
For example, if the `id` value is 1 and the `seq` value is 2, the `grpid` value will be 1 (because 1 mod 2 = 1). If the `id` value is 2 and the `seq` value is 3, the `grpid` value will be 2 (because 2 mod 3 = 2).
Finally, the output statement outputs the observations with the group id included.
Note that the BY statement in this code is used to group observations by the `id` and `seq` variables, but you can use any combination of variables that you want to group by.",0.44595104455947876,"sas, sas-macro",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To fix the problem and generate the desired output, you can use SAS macros and the `retain` statement to create a group ID based on the ID and value variables. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the data by the ID and SEQ variables using the `PROC SORT` procedure. Since you mentioned that you cannot change the sorting, make sure the data is already sorted correctly.

```sas
proc sort data=have;
  by id seq;
run;
```

2. Define a SAS macro that will generate the group ID based on the ID and value variables. The macro will use the `retain` statement to keep track of the previous values and increment the group ID whenever there is a change.

```sas
%macro generate_groupid;
  data want;
    set have;
    by id seq;

    retain grpid;

    if first.id then grpid = 1;
    else if value ne lag(value) then grpid + 1;

    drop lag:;
  run;
%mend;
```

3. Call the macro to generate the group ID variable.

```sas
%generate_groupid;
```

4. Check the output dataset to verify if the group ID variable was generated correctly.

```sas
proc print data=want;
  var id seq value grpid;
run;
```

The output should match the desired result you mentioned in your question.

namespace Colors
{
    static const std::string s_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;
}

","Correct?
Yes. static here means that each translation unit (TU) that includes this header will have a unique object. So there isn't 1 s_blue object for the whole project, but one for each TU.
However since it's const all objects will be equal, so for the user it doesn't make a difference.
Recommended?
Maybe, depends.
The big downside is that you create multiple objects and all of them are initialized at program startup.
Another possible downside is the access pattern. If the program assesses s_blue from multiple TUs in quick succession it could trash the cache.
However for certain programs and scenarios this could be the best option or at least &quot;good enough&quot;. For instance (spoiler for next paragraph) in a header only library or before C++17.
Are there better alternatives?
Yes, but they cannot always be used.
extern
Make it an extern declaration in the header and in just 1 TU have the definition.
// constants.hpp
extern const std::string k_blue;

// constants.cpp
#include &quot;constants.hpp&quot;
const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

This is clearly superior in terms of performance over OP. However you can't use it in a header only lib.
Even in a normal program static could be preferred as the ease of declaring and defining the constants in just one place could be seen as outweighing the performance downsides in specific projects.
constexpr inline string_view C++17
A clearly better alternative if it's available (since C++17) is string_view. It's very light weight but has all the amenities of a modern container (unlike raw const char[]). And since you already are in C++17 you should make it constexpr inline:
constexpr inline std::string_view k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

inline const std::string c++17
If for whatever reason you need std::string over std::string_view you can inline the variable for better optimization:
inline const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

","  It is generally not recommended to define a global static constant `std::string` in a header file, as it can lead to potential issues with multiple inclusions and linkage. Here's why:
When you define a global static constant in a header file, it is defined as a global variable in the entire program, and its value is initialized only once, when the header file is included. However, if multiple source files include the header file, they will all initialize the static constant with the same value, which can cause inconsistencies and bugs.
Moreover, when you link multiple object files that include the header file, they will all use the same definition of the static constant, which can lead to linkage issues and inconsistencies.
A better approach is to define the `std::string` constant in a source file or even better, in a separate header file that is only included in the source file where it is used. This ensures that the constant is only defined once, and its value is consistent across all the files that use it.
In your case, you can define the `s_blue` constant in a source file like this:
`colors.cpp`:
```c++
namespace Colors {
    static const std::string s_blue = ""Blue"";
}
```
By doing this, you ensure that the constant is only defined once, in the source file where it is used, and its value is consistent across all the files that use it.
Alternatively, you can define the constant in a separate header file, like this:
`colors_constants.h`:
```c++
namespace Colors {
    // define the constant here
    static const std::string s_blue = ""Blue"";
}
```
Then, include the header file in the source file where you use the constant, like this:
`colors.cpp`:
```c++
#include ""colors_constants.h""
```
By doing this, you separate the definition of the constant from the source code that uses it, which makes it easier to manage and maintain your code.",0.7746174931526184,c++,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

// constants.cpp
#include &quot;constants.hpp&quot;
const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

This is clearly superior in terms of performance over OP. However you can't use it in a header only lib.
Even in a normal program static could be preferred as the ease of declaring and defining the constants in just one place could be seen as outweighing the performance downsides in specific projects.
constexpr inline string_view C++17
A clearly better alternative if it's available (since C++17) is string_view. It's very light weight but has all the amenities of a modern container (unlike raw const char[]). And since you already are in C++17 you should make it constexpr inline:
constexpr inline std::string_view k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

inline const std::string c++17
If for whatever reason you need std::string over std::string_view you can inline the variable for better optimization:
inline const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

","Defining a global static const std::string in a header file is generally correct and can be done in C++. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

Firstly, it is important to note that when you define a global static const variable in a header file, each translation unit (source file) that includes that header will have its own copy of the variable. This can potentially lead to multiple definitions of the same variable, which will result in linker errors.

To avoid this, you should mark the variable as 'extern' in the header file and then define it in one of the source files. Here's an example:

In the header file (e.g., colors.h):

```cpp
namespace Colors
{
    extern const std::string s_blue;
}
```

In a source file (e.g., colors.cpp):

```cpp
#include ""colors.h""

namespace Colors
{
    const std::string s_blue = ""Blue"";
}
```

By doing this, you ensure that there is only one definition of the variable in the entire program, and all other source files that include the header file will use that single definition.

It's also worth mentioning that the 'static' keyword in this context has a slightly different meaning than its usual usage. In the case of a global variable, 'static' is used to give the variable internal linkage, meaning it is only accessible within the translation unit where it is defined. However, using 'static' in this case is not necessary because the 'extern' keyword already provides the necessary external linkage.

In summary, it is generally correct to define a global static const std::string in a header file, but you should use the 'extern' keyword to avoid multiple definitions and define the variable in one of the source files.",0.7707811594009399,c++,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last &quot;terraform apply&quot; which may have
affected this plan:

  # azurerm_resource_group.myrg has changed

      + tags     = {}
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
    }

Based on what I've tried to find about this online, it looks like this warning is because Azure adds an empty tag array to a resource group during creation. Then when terraform compares the now existing resource with the configuration file and state, it's now warning you there is a difference. I'm not quite sure how terraform reconciles this on the third terraform plan though....
What should be the workflow here? Particularly when thinking about CI?
It appears to just be noise to be informed of the existence of an empty, optional attribute that I haven't defined.
I've looked at -refresh=false but it looks like this could suppress a genuine change that has occurred on your infrastructure that you may want to be notified about. When using -refresh-only on the second terraform plan and apply it just outputs the same noise as above.
","Indeed, what you have observed here is a small bug in the Azure provider where it is being inconsistent between the object it returns during apply and the object it returns during refresh.
It is typically okay for a provider to insert a default value for an argument that wasn't set, which is what seems to be happening here, but a provider ought to be consistent in doing so in all of its results: in the initial plan, in the new state created after apply, and in the refreshed state created on the next plan. Terraform produces this message in particular if the refreshed state created on the next plan is different than the new state that was created by the previous apply.

One way to hide the bug would be to explicitly set the tags argument to the default value that the provider's refresh step is inserting:
resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;myrg&quot; {
  name     = &quot;MyResourceGroup&quot;
  location = &quot;westeurope&quot;

  tags = {}
}

As long as the provider logic doesn't treat an empty map as special during plan and apply (which I'm not sure about), this should hopefully cause the initial result to agree with the refreshed result and thus avoid showing an incorrect &quot;changed outside of Terraform&quot; note.

Another separate answer is to change your output value to return more specific attributes of the resource group, so that Terraform can see that the end result doesn't depend on the tags attribute.
Terraform shows this message in an attempt to explain why the resource_group_details output value is also planned to change, and so Terraform shouldn't show the message if it can be sure that your output value won't be affected by the change to the tags. For example:
output &quot;resource_group_details&quot; {
  value = {
    name     = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
    location = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    # (...and any other attributes you want to export,
    # as long as you don't refer to &quot;tags&quot;.)
  }
}

Note that this rule generally applies to anything in your configuration that may directly or indirectly refer to the tags attribute, so if there's more to your configuration that you didn't show here then you should also make sure that nothing else refers to tags.
Terraform's analysis of this is not fully precise, so if it isn't sure that there aren't any references to tags then it will still show the note just in case. Therefore you would need to stick to relatively simple expressions that refer directly to individual attributes of azurerm_resource_group.myrg, and avoid using expressions which do dynamic work with the entire resource object which would prevent Terraform's analysis from proving that the tags attribute is unused.
","  Ah, I see! Yes, you're right. The ""Objects have changed outside of Terraform"" warning is indeed due to Azure adding an empty tag array to the resource group during creation. This is a known issue in Terraform and can be suppressed by using the `-refresh=false` option.
However, as you mentioned, this can potentially suppress actual changes to your infrastructure, so it's important to use it with caution.
In terms of workflow, here's what you can do:
1. When you're running Terraform in a CI environment, you can use `-refresh=false` to suppress the warning for the initial creation of the resource group. This way, Terraform will only look at the configuration file and state, and not at the actual resources on Azure.
2. If you want to update the resource group with new attributes or changes, you can use `-refresh-only` to only update the resources that have changed since the last apply. This will prevent Terraform from creating a new resource group with the unnecessary empty tag array.
3. When you're ready to apply the updates to the resource group, you can use `-refresh` to refresh the entire infrastructure and apply the changes.
So, your workflow could be:
* Run Terraform with `-refresh=false` to create the initial resource group.
* If you want to update the resource group with new attributes or changes, run Terraform with `- refresh-only`.
* Once you're ready to apply the updates to the resource group, run Terraform with `-refresh`.
By using `-refresh=false` in your CI environment, you can avoid the ""Objects have changed outside of Terraform"" warning for the initial creation of the resource group. And by using `-refresh-only` when updating the resource group, you can avoid creating a new resource group with the unnecessary empty tag array.

","The warning message you are seeing is a common issue when using Terraform with Azure resources. It occurs because Azure automatically adds an empty tag array to a resource group during creation, which causes a difference between the existing resource and the configuration file.

To address this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the first `terraform apply` command to create the resource group. This will create the resource group with the empty tag array.

2. After the resource group is created, run the second `terraform apply` command. This will detect the difference between the existing resource and the configuration file, but since the only difference is the empty tag array, it will not make any changes to the resource group.

3. Run the third `terraform plan` command. This time, Terraform will not detect any changes because the existing resource matches the configuration.

Regarding the workflow for CI, it is recommended to use a combination of Terraform and Azure DevOps to automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure. You can set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps to trigger Terraform commands whenever there are changes to your infrastructure code. This will ensure that your infrastructure is always up-to-date and consistent with the desired state.

To suppress the noise caused by the empty tag array, you can use the `-refresh=false` flag during the `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` command. However, this may also suppress genuine changes that have occurred on your infrastructure, so it is not recommended unless you are confident that there are no other changes.

In summary, the workflow for addressing the ""Objects have changed outside of Terraform"" warning is to create the resource with the empty tag array, let Terraform detect the difference without making any changes, and then confirm that there are no further changes in subsequent runs.",0.6662654876708984,"azure, azure-devops, terraform, terraform-provider-azure",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

In this updated code, we've added a new `BeginPreview` method that will start a new frame of the editor when the mouse is down, and an `EndPreview` method that will render the updated frame after the mouse drag has completed. We've also removed the `OnPreviewRender` method and replaced it with the `BeginPreview` and `EndPreview` methods.
Additionally, we've updated the `RotateAroundPivot` method to use the `Quaternion.LookRotation` function to calculate the correct rotation quaternion based on the provided Euler angles. This should give you more accurate results when rotating the camera around a pivot point.
With these changes, the camera should now update in real-time when you drag the mouse, without any lag or delay.",0.6163294315338135,"c#, unity3d",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To fix the problem of the image not updating in real-time while the user is dragging the mouse, you need to modify the code in the `OnPointerMoveHandler` method.

Currently, the code is rendering the new camera location using the `BeginPreview`, `camera.Render`, and `EndAndDrawPreview` methods, which can cause a lag in updating the image.

To achieve real-time updates, you can make the following changes:

1. Remove the `BeginPreview` and `EndAndDrawPreview` calls from the `OnPointerMoveHandler` method. We will render the preview only once in the `CreateGUI` method.

2. Update the `_totalRotation` and camera position in the `OnPointerMoveHandler` method.

Here's the modified code:

```csharp
private void CreateGUI()
{
    // Create Image
    _image = new Image();
    rootVisualElement.Add(_image);

    // Setup Mouse Handlers for image
    // note image should be focusable for image to receive all event types
    _image.RegisterCallback<PointerDownEvent>(OnPointerDownHandler);
    _image.RegisterCallback<PointerMoveEvent>(OnPointerMoveHandler);
    _image.RegisterCallback<PointerUpEvent>(OnPointerUpHandler);

    // create and assign Render Texture to Image
    _previewUtility.BeginPreview(ImageDimension, GUIStyle.none);
    _previewUtility.camera.Render();
    _image.image = _previewUtility.EndPreview();
}

private void OnPointerMoveHandler(PointerMoveEvent evt)
{
    // If the mouse is not down do nothing
    if (!_mouseIsDown)
    {
        return;
    }

    // Calculate delta and add it to the total rotation
    Vector3 delta = evt.position - _previousMousePosition;
    _previousMousePosition = evt.position;
    _totalRotation += delta;

    // pivot camera around (0, 0, 0)
    _previewUtility.camera.transform.position = RotateAroundPivot(DefaultCameraPosition, Vector3.zero, _totalRotation);
    _previewUtility.camera.transform.LookAt(Vector3.zero);
}
```

With these changes, the image will update in real-time as the user drags the mouse, without any noticeable lag.

this should basically give you 6 groups ([0s-9s -&gt; 0], [10s-19s -&gt; 1], etc. for the 3rd groupby index) for every minute of data.
","  The issue you're facing is likely due to the `ltt` column being of type string, and pandas cannot compute rolling windows on string values. To fix this, you can convert the `ltt` column to a datetime type using the `pd.to_datetime()` function.
Here's an updated version of your function that should work:
```def strategy1(record):
    global datalist

    datalist.append(record)
    pandas_df = pd.DataFrame(datalist)
    # Convert 'ltt' column to datetime type
    pandas_df['ltt'] = pd.to_datetime(pandas_df['ltt'], format=&quot;%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y&quot;)
    # Group by second and compute moving average for the last 10 seconds
    pandas_df['hour'] = pandas_df['ltt'].dt.hour
    pandas_df['minute'] = pandas_df['ltt'].dt.minute
    pandas_df['second'] = pandas_df['ltt'].dt.second
    # Compute rolling mean for the last 10 seconds
    pandas_df['max'] = pandas_df.groupby('second')['last'].transform('max')
    pandas_df[&quot;ma_1min&quot;] = (
        pandas_df.sort_values(pandas_df['ltt'])
            .groupby([pandas_df['hour'], pandas_df['minute']])[pandas_df['last']]
            .transform(lambda x: x.rolling('10sec', min_periods=1).mean())

    )
    print(pandas_df)

```
In this updated version, I've added the `pd.to_datetime()` function to convert the `ltt` column to a datetime type. I've also updated the `rolling` function to use the `min_periods=1` parameter to specify that we want to compute the rolling mean for the last 10 seconds.
Note that I've also removed the `dt.second` attribute from the `pandas_df` object, as it's not necessary in this case.
With these changes, the function should now work correctly and compute the rolling mean for the last 10 seconds for each sample in the data.",0.6004114747047424,"python, pandas",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

```python

    )

    print(pandas_df)

strategy1(records1)
```

In the updated code, I changed the column name to 'ma_10sec' to reflect the 10-second window size. I also replaced the string '10sec' with the numeric value 10 in the rolling function to specify the window size in seconds.

","Events get propagated up the tree to their parents, so this behaviour is normal. In order to stop the propagation, try adding this to your child handleSubmit:

        event.preventDefault();
      }
      if (typeof event.stopPropagation === 'function') {
        event.stopPropagation();
      }
    }

","  Ah, I see the problem. The issue is that you have both forms nested inside each other, and the `onSubmit` event is triggered on the parent form when the child form submits. This is because the `onSubmit` event is called on the parent form's `handleSubmit` function, which is not isolated to the child form.
To fix this issue, you can use the `event.stopPropagation()` method to prevent the parent form's `onSubmit` event from being triggered when the child form submits. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:
```javascript
                &lt;form
                    onSubmit={(event) =&gt; {
                        // Child Form's onSubmit function here//
                          // stopPropagation to prevent parent form's onSubmit from being triggered
                          event.stopPropagation();
                          if (event) {
                            // handle the child form's submission here//

                          }
                    }}
                  &gt;

```
By calling `event.stopPropagation()` inside the child form's `onSubmit` function, you are preventing the parent form's `onSubmit` event from being triggered. This way, you can handle the child form's submission without affecting the parent form's functionality.
Note that you can also use `event.preventdefault()` instead of `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the event from being triggered, but `event.stopPropagation()` is more commonly used in React Hook Form.
Also, I see that you are using `handleSubmit(submitFunctionA)` in the parent form, and `handleSubmit(submitFunctionB)` in the child form. You can simplify this by using a single `handleSubmit` function that takes a callback function as an argument, like this:
```javascript
                &lt;form
                    onSubmit={handleSubmit(submitFunction)}
                  &gt;

```
Then, in the child form, you can call the `submitFunction` with the proper arguments:
```javascript

                &lt;form
                    onSubmit={handleSubmit(submitFunctionB)}
                  &gt;

```
This way, you can avoid duplicate code and make your code more concise and easier to read.

","To fix the issue of nested forms triggering each other's handleSubmit() functions in React Hook Form, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have imported the necessary dependencies for React Hook Form in both FormA and FormB components.

2. In your parent component (FormA), modify the onSubmit prop of the FormA component to pass the handleSubmit() function as a callback to the child component (FormB):

```jsx
<FormA onSubmit={handleSubmit(submitFunctionA)}>
  ...
  <FormB onSubmit={handleSubmit(submitFunctionB)} />
  ...
</FormA>
```

3. In your child component (FormB), modify the onSubmit prop of the form element to execute the handleSubmit() function for FormB only:

```jsx
<form
  onSubmit={(event) => {
    handleSubmit(onSubmitB)(event);

    if (event) {
      if (typeof event.preventDefault === ""function"") {
        event.preventDefault();
      }
      if (typeof event.stopPropagation === ""function"") {
        event.stopPropagation();
      }
    }
  }}
>
  ...
</form>
```

By doing this, you are isolating the handleSubmit() functions for FormA and FormB, ensuring that they don't trigger each other when submitting the forms.",0.3896360397338867,"reactjs, forms, next.js, react-hook-form",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  No problem! It seems like you're trying to map over the JSON data and extract the keys that start with ""type"". You can achieve this by using the `filter()` method to filter out the keys that don't match the pattern you're interested in, and then mapping over the filtered array of keys.
Here's an updated example that should work:
```
const data = await response.json();
const filteredData = data.filter((item: any) => item.key().startsWith('type'));
return filteredData.map((item: any) => ({ id: item.key(), value: item.key(), title: item.key()}));
```
Explanation:

* The `filter()` method takes a function as an argument that checks each item in the array and returns a boolean value indicating whether the item passes the filter. In this case, we're passing a function that checks if the key starts with ""type"".
* The `map()` method takes a function as an argument that returns a new value for each item in the array. In this case, we're using the `id`, `value`, and `title` properties of each item in the filtered array to create a new object with these properties.
With this code, you should get an array of objects with the desired properties and values.
Also, you can add a check to make sure that the response is not null or empty before mapping over it:
```
if (response.ok) {
  const data = await response.json();
  const filteredData = data.filter((item: any) => item.key().startsWith('type'));
  return filteredData.map((item: any) => ({ id: item.key(), value: item.key(), title: item.key()}));
} else {
  console.error('Failed to fetch data');
  return [];

```

","You are setting the stack view axis to Vertical -- but you want Horizontal scrolling... so set it to .horizontal.
You are setting Height for each arranged subview, but you haven't set the Widths... so give them Widths.

Should get you on your way...
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with converting a vertical UIScrollView to a horizontal one in SwiftUI.
Firstly, let me point out that using `UIScrollView` in SwiftUI is not the best approach, as `UIScrollView` is a legacy view that does not take full advantage of SwiftUI's powerful layout systems. Instead, you might want to consider using `UIScrollView` in conjunction with `UIHostingController` to create a scrolling view that can display a variety of views.
That being said, to convert a vertical `UIScrollView` to a horizontal one, you can simply use the `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` property to disable the automatic layout constraints set by SwiftUI. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:
1. First, create a new `UIScrollView` instance and set its `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` property to `false`.
```swift
let scrollView = UIScrollView()
scrollView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
```
2. Next, create a `UIStackView` instance and add it as a subview to the `UIScrollView`. Set the `axis` property of the `UIStackView` to `.horizontal`, and set the `spacing` property to a value of your choice (e.g., `10`).
```swift
let scrollViewContainer = UIStackView()
scrollView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

scrollViewContainer.axis = .horizontal
scrollViewContainer.spacing = 10
```
3. Then, add the views that you want to display in the scrolling area. In your case, you have three views: `redView`, `blueView`, and `greenView`. Add each of these views as subviews to the `UIStackView`.
```swift

scrollViewContainer.addArrangedSubview(redView)
scrollViewContainer.addArrangedSubview(blueView)
scrollViewContainer.addArrangedSubview(greenView)
```
4. Finally, set the `leadingAnchor`, `trailingAnchor`, `topAnchor`, and `bottomAnchor` constraints of the `UIScrollView` to the corresponding views in the `UIStackView`. This will create a horizontal scrolling view that displays the three views you have provided.
```swift

scrollView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollViewContainer.leadingAnchor).isActive = true
scrollView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollViewContainer.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
scrollView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollViewContainer.topAnchor).isActive = true
scrollView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollViewContainer.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
```

Note that in order for the scrolling to work properly, you will also need to set the `widthAnchor` constraint of the `UIStackView` to the `UIScrollView` using the `equalTo` method. This will ensure that the `UIStackView` takes up the full width of the `UIScrollView`.
```swift

scrollViewContainer.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.widthAnchor).isActive = true
```

","To convert a vertical UIScrollView to a horizontal one, you need to make a few modifications to the code you provided.

First, you need to change the axis of the scrollViewContainer from vertical to horizontal. Replace this line:

```swift
view.axis = .vertical
```

with:

```swift
view.axis = .horizontal
```

Next, you need to adjust the heightAnchor constraints of the redView, blueView, and greenView to widthAnchor constraints. Replace these lines:

```swift
view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 500).isActive = true
view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 200).isActive = true
view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 1200).isActive = true
```

with:

```swift
view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 500).isActive = true
view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 200).isActive = true
view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 1200).isActive = true
```

Finally, change the widthAnchor constraint of the scrollViewContainer to the heightAnchor constraint of the scrollView. Replace this line:

```swift
scrollViewContainer.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.widthAnchor).isActive = true
```

with:

```swift
scrollViewContainer.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.heightAnchor).isActive = true
```

With these modifications, the UIScrollView should now scroll horizontally.",0.67119300365448,"swift, uiscrollview, uikit",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

This code works perfectly on VirtualBox, but when I try to run it on my PC (by copying it into a flash drive and booting from it), something very strange happens. The cursor is moved to the bottom-right area of the screen and prints off a strange character (An O but with an arrow coming off at the NE corner).

First, we cleared the segments to ensure that BIOS didn't give us junk values that will cause trouble later. We also cleared the code segments to make sure that we are in address 0x0000:0x7c00 instead of its equivalents such as 0x07c0:0x0000. I formatted the code, and move the data down so you can manipulate them easier. Your code also lacked padding and signature which were added. I also added some MBR partition tables in case you are booting from harddrive or equivalent system. You could also add a BPB, you can find the structure to that here:

","  It seems that your boot sector is printing strange characters when run on real hardware. There are a few possible reasons for this:
1. Overwriting the Boot Code: When running the boot sector in real hardware, it might be overwriting the code segment or stack, which could cause unexpected behavior. To avoid this, make sure to set the boot sector's stack base to a location above the BIOS's shadow stack (usually at 0x8000 or higher).
2. Incorrectly Configure Registers: When running the boot sector in real hardware, the processor's registers might be configured differently than in VirtualBox. Make sure to set the necessary registers (e.g., AH, BX, BP) to the correct values before jumping to the main function.
3. Non-Standard Boot Order: Some BIOSes may have non-standard boot order options set by default, which could cause the boot sector to execute incorrectly. Check the BIOS settings to ensure that the boot order is set correctly.
4. USB Drive Issues: If you are trying to run the boot sector from a USB drive, make sure that it is properly formatted and recognized by the BIOS. Some BIOSes may have issues with certain USB drive formats or may not recognize them at all.
Here are some troubleshooting steps to help you fix the issue:
1. Check the assembly code: Make sure that the assembly code is correct and free of errors. Use a disassembler to check the code and ensure that it is identical to what you have written.
2. Use a debugger: Use a debugging tool (such as DBG) to step through the assembly code line by line and check the values of the registers and memory locations. This can help you identify where the issue is occurring.
3. Test with a different BIOS: If you are using a particular BIOS, try booting the flash drive on a different BIOS to see if the issue persists. If it does, then the issue is likely BIOS-specific and not related to the assembly code.
4. Try a different Flash Drive: If you are using a particular flash drive, try booting the assembly code on a different flash drive to see if the issue persists. If it does, then the issue may be related to the flash drive.
5. Check for BIOS Updates: Make sure that your BIOS is up-to-date, as newer BIOS versions may have improved support for booting from USB drives.
6. Consult the Boot sector documentation: Check the documentation for the boot sector you are using to see if there are any specific configuration options or setup requirements for booting from USB drives.
In summary, there are several reasons why your boot sector may be printing strange characters when run on real hardware. By checking the assembly code, using a debugger, testing with different BIOSes and flash drives, and consulting the boot sector documentation, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue.",0.5266791582107544,"assembly, x86, nasm, bootloader, usb-drive",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Based on the provided code, it seems like there are a few issues that could be causing the problem when running on real hardware. Here are some possible explanations and solutions:

1. Memory Addressing: The code assumes that it will be loaded at memory address 0x7C00, which is the standard location for bootloaders. However, on some real hardware, the bootloader may be loaded at a different address. To ensure that the code is executed correctly, you can add a jump instruction at the beginning of the bootloader to reach the correct location. For example:

```
jmp 0x0000:start
start:
```

2. Stack Setup: The stack is set up at address 0x8000 in the code, which might work in a virtual environment but not on real hardware. To ensure proper stack setup, you can set the stack pointer (SP) to a different value, such as 0x7C00. Modify the following lines in your code:

```
mov bp, 0x7C00
mov sp, bp
```

3. BIOS Function Calls: The code uses BIOS interrupts (e.g., int 0x10, int 0x16) to perform certain operations. However, different BIOS implementations on real hardware might have different behavior or requirements. It's possible that the BIOS interrupt calls are not functioning as expected on your specific hardware. To overcome this, you can try alternative methods or use low-level hardware access techniques instead of relying on BIOS interrupts.

4. USB Drive Booting: Booting from a USB drive can introduce additional complexities compared to booting from a virtual environment. Make sure that your USB drive is properly formatted and set up to be bootable. Additionally, check the boot order in your BIOS settings to ensure that the USB drive is selected as the primary boot device.

5. Debugging: If the issue persists, you can try adding debug statements or using a debugger to gain more insights into the problem. This can help identify specific points of failure or unexpected behavior during the execution of the bootloader.

Remember that different hardware configurations and BIOS implementations can vary, so it's essential to test and adapt your code accordingly.",0.5621693730354309,"assembly, x86, nasm, bootloader, usb-drive",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

y = [collect(t) for t in zip(x...)]

After obtaining `y`, you can compute the minimum of each vector using the `minimum` function as follows:

```julia
min_values = minimum.(y)
```

The `minimum.(y)` syntax applies the `minimum` function element-wise to each vector in `y`, resulting in a `Vector{Int64}` containing the minimum values of each vector.

","  The issue you're facing is that the `win_disk_facts` module is returning a list of dictionaries, but the `loop` keyword is expecting a single dictionary. To fix this, you can modify the `loop` keyword to iterate over each item in the list of dictionaries returned by `win_disk_facts`, like so:

The `items` filter is used to extract each item from the list, and the `item` variable represents the current item being iterated over.

","  Thank you for reaching out! It's possible that the Anaconda Navigator may not be visible in the Applications folder due to the way Anaconda is installed on your M1 MacBook Pro. Here are some potential solutions you can try:
1. Check the Application folder: Although the Anaconda download page recommends installing Anaconda via the command line, it's possible that the installation may have failed to place the Navigator app in the Application folder. Try opening the Applications folder from Finder and look for the Anaconda Navigator app. If it's not there, proceed to the next solution.
2. Look for the Anaconda binary in the terminal: As Anaconda is installed via the graphical installer, you may find the Anaconda binary in the /Applications/Anaconda3/bin directory. Open the Terminal application on your MacBook Pro and type the following command to locate the Anaconda binary:
`/Applications/Anaconda3/bin/anaconda`
This command will open the Anaconda Navigator app.
3. Add Anaconda to the Dock: If the Anaconda Navigator app is not visible in the Application folder or the terminal, you can add it to the Dock for easy access. To do this, open the Dock by clicking on the Dock icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Right-click on an empty area of the Dock and select ""User Interface"" > ""Add to Dock"". Then, drag the Anaconda Navigator app to the Dock.
4. Update Anaconda: Check if Anaconda needs to be updated. Open the Terminal application and type the following command to check for updates:
`anaconda-client --check-update`
If updates are available, you can install them by running the following command:
`anaconda-client install --all`
5. Reinstall Anaconda: If none of the above solutions work, you can try reinstalling Anaconda by deleting the Anaconda3 folder and running the installation again from the Anaconda website. To do this, navigate to the Applications folder, find the Anaconda3 folder, right-click on it, and select ""Move to Trash"". Empty the Trashcan by clicking on the ""Empty Trash"" button in the Finder menu bar. Then, download and install Anaconda again from the Anaconda website.

","The issue you are facing with not being able to find the Anaconda Navigator app after installing Anaconda on your M1 MacBook Pro could be due to compatibility issues with the M1 chipset.

Currently, Anaconda does not have an official release specifically for the M1 architecture. However, you can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Open the Terminal application on your MacBook Pro.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   conda init
   ```
   This command initializes the Anaconda environment.
   
3. Close the Terminal application and open a new Terminal window.

4. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   anaconda-navigator
   ```
   This command should launch the Anaconda Navigator app.

If the above steps do not work, you can try the following alternative methods:

1. Use the command line: Instead of using the Anaconda Navigator app, you can manage your environments and packages using the command line interface. Open the Terminal application and use the `conda` command to create and manage environments, install packages, etc.

2. Use the Anaconda Prompt: Anaconda provides a separate command prompt called ""Anaconda Prompt"" that you can use to manage your environments and packages. You can search for ""Anaconda Prompt"" in the Applications folder and launch it.

3. Use Miniforge: Miniforge is an alternative distribution of conda that is specifically optimized for the M1 architecture. You can try installing Miniforge instead of Anaconda and see if it resolves the issue. Instructions for installing Miniforge can be found on their official website.

It's worth noting that the M1 architecture is relatively new, and software compatibility is still being improved. Keep an eye on the official Anaconda website for any updates or announcements regarding M1 support.",0.7178917527198792,"python, macos, anaconda, anaconda3",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

  b: [6,9,4],  
  c: [7,10,9],  
  d: [8,12],  
  e: [1]
}

","This is a good opportunity to show off the neat javascript spread syntax, Array and Object prototype functions, and destructuring patterns.
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries).reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})

As simple as this!

Extended answer

Object.values takes the values of all properties of an object and makes a list out of them. The rules of iteration are same as for...in
For example:
Object.values(obj1)
// The result will be:
[{a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8}, {a:6,b:9,c:10,d:12,e:1}, {a:3,b:4,c:9}]


Object.entries is similar to Object.values above, but it generates a list of [key, val] pairs instead, one for each property.
For example:
Object.entries({a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8})
// The result will be:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]]


Array.flatMap applies the passed function on all elements of an array (just like map), but in the end, it flattens the result. That means, if the result is a list of lists, it returns only one big array with all inner elements.
For example:
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries)
// By passing Object.entries as function,
// it will extract all the key-value pairs in one big list
[['a',5],['b',6],['c',7],['d',8], ['a',6],['b',9],['c',10],['d',12],['e',1], ['a',3],['b',4],['c',9]]


The spread syntax (...) is a neat feature of javascript, that is used to semantically refer to the enumeration of something.

When used in array literals, you can merge and append values together to form a bigger array.
Like this:
 o = {a: [5, 6]}

 o.a = [...o.a, 3]     // all elements from o.a, appending 3
 { a:[5, 6, 3] }

 o.d = [...o.d, 8]     // TypeError: o.d is undefined
 o.d = [...o.d||[], 8] // if o.d is undefined, use [], then append 8
 { a:[5, 6, 3], d:[8] }

 // This is useful as a semantic: &quot;append to list or create a new one&quot;

[Note 1]: o.d||[] works because undefined is falsy and the logical OR operator || short circuits.

When the spread syntax is used in object literals, you can merge objects together or append new properties.
Like this:
o = { 
  ...o,                       // all properties of o
  ...{b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9]}, // all properties of the literal
  d: [...o.d||[], 12],        // overriding property d
  ['e']: [1]                  // new property with computed name
}
// Result will be:      
{ a:[5,6,3], b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9], d:[8,12], e:[1] }




Array.reduce iterates over a list, applying the passed function and accumulating the results. In the end, it returns the accumulated value. The returned value depends on the operation performed by the passed function.
For example, you can use reduce to sum over all elements of an array.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; curr + acc, 0)
// It is the same as (((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)
15

However, you can also use reduce to take [key, val] pairs from a list and make them properties into an object (like Object.fromEntries, but more flexible).
This snippet below uses a destructuring pattern to unpack the [k, v] pairs passed as function parameter, and uses [k] as computed property name.
See:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]:v }), {})
// The result will be:
{ a:5, b:6, c:7, d:8 }

[['a',5], ['b',6], ['a',6]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]:v }), {})
// Property a is repeated, so it will honor only the last value
{ a:6, b:6 }

// But if we use the semantic &quot;append or create&quot; mentioned above,
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['a',6]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})
// The result will be:
{ a:[5,6], b:[6] }



Now just bring it all together:
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries).reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})

// You can read it as:
// From all entries of the inner-lists of obj1, 
// create one big flat array of [k, v] out of them
// and go adding each one as a property into a new object acc
// grouping the value in lists.

// Final result will be:
{ a:[5,6,3], b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9], d:[8,12], e:[1] }    

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To merge the nested objects and group the values of properties with the same key, you can use the `Object.values()` method to create an array of all the properties in the object, and then use `Array.prototype.forEach()` to loop through the array and merge the properties of the nested objects.
Here's an example implementation:
```
// Get the desired output object
const output =mergeNestedObjects( obj1 );

// Function to merge nested objects and group properties
function mergeNestedObjects( obj ) {
  // Create an array of all the properties in the object
  const properties = Object.values( obj );
  
  // Loop through the array of properties
  properties.forEach( ( property ) => {
    // Get the nested objects for the current property
    const nestedObjs = obj[ property ];
    
    // Merge the nested objects
    const mergedNestedObjs = mergeObjects( nestedObjs );
    
    // Loop through the merged nested objects
    mergedNestedObjs.forEach( ( nestedObj ) => {
      // Append the matching properties to the output object
      if (typeof nestedObj === 'object') {
        output[ property ] = [ ...output[ property ], ...nestedObj ];
      }
    });

  });
  return output;
}


 // Function to merge nested objects
 function mergeObjects( obj1, obj2 ) {
  const result = {};
  for ( const prop in obj1 ) {
    if (obj1[ prop ] !== undefined) {
      result[ prop ] = obj1[ prop ];
      if (obj2[ prop ] !== undefined) {
        result[ prop ] = [ ...result[ prop ], ...obj2[ prop ] ];
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
In this implementation, the `mergeNestedObjects()` function first creates an array of all the properties in the input object using `Object.values()`. Then it loops through the array of properties and merges the nested objects for each property using `mergeObjects()`. If the nested objects are merged successfully, the matching properties are appended to the output object.
Finally, the function returns the output object.
Note that the `mergeObjects()` function is a simple implementation that merges two objects by concatenating their properties. You can optimize this function by using a more sophisticated merging algorithm if needed.
Also, the output object is created using the spread operator `[ ...output, ...nestedObj ]` to preserve the original properties of the nested objects.

73419719,"Merge nested objects in JavaScript, and append matching properties in array","I have an object like this, with nested objects:
obj1 = { 
  1: { a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8 },
  2: { a:6,b:9,c:10,d:12,e:1 },
  3: { a:3,b:4,c:9 },
}

I want to merge all its nested objects, while grouping in a list the values of properties with the same key.
Desired output:
{ 
  a: [5,6,3],  
  b: [6,9,4],  
  c: [7,10,9],  
  d: [8,12],  
  e: [1]
}

","This is a good opportunity to show off the neat javascript spread syntax, Array and Object prototype functions, and destructuring patterns.
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries).reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})

As simple as this!

Extended answer

Object.values takes the values of all properties of an object and makes a list out of them. The rules of iteration are same as for...in
For example:
Object.values(obj1)
// The result will be:
[{a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8}, {a:6,b:9,c:10,d:12,e:1}, {a:3,b:4,c:9}]


Object.entries is similar to Object.values above, but it generates a list of [key, val] pairs instead, one for each property.
For example:
Object.entries({a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8})
// The result will be:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]]


Array.flatMap applies the passed function on all elements of an array (just like map), but in the end, it flattens the result. That means, if the result is a list of lists, it returns only one big array with all inner elements.
For example:
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries)
// By passing Object.entries as function,
// it will extract all the key-value pairs in one big list
[['a',5],['b',6],['c',7],['d',8], ['a',6],['b',9],['c',10],['d',12],['e',1], ['a',3],['b',4],['c',9]]


The spread syntax (...) is a neat feature of javascript, that is used to semantically refer to the enumeration of something.

When used in array literals, you can merge and append values together to form a bigger array.
Like this:
 o = {a: [5, 6]}

 o.a = [...o.a, 3]     // all elements from o.a, appending 3
 { a:[5, 6, 3] }

 o.d = [...o.d, 8]     // TypeError: o.d is undefined
 o.d = [...o.d||[], 8] // if o.d is undefined, use [], then append 8
 { a:[5, 6, 3], d:[8] }

 // This is useful as a semantic: &quot;append to list or create a new one&quot;

[Note 1]: o.d||[] works because undefined is falsy and the logical OR operator || short circuits.

When the spread syntax is used in object literals, you can merge objects together or append new properties.
Like this:
o = { 
  ...o,                       // all properties of o
  ...{b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9]}, // all properties of the literal
  d: [...o.d||[], 12],        // overriding property d
  ['e']: [1]                  // new property with computed name
}
// Result will be:      
{ a:[5,6,3], b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9], d:[8,12], e:[1] }




Array.reduce iterates over a list, applying the passed function and accumulating the results. In the end, it returns the accumulated value. The returned value depends on the operation performed by the passed function.
For example, you can use reduce to sum over all elements of an array.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; curr + acc, 0)
// It is the same as (((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)
15

However, you can also use reduce to take [key, val] pairs from a list and make them properties into an object (like Object.fromEntries, but more flexible).
This snippet below uses a destructuring pattern to unpack the [k, v] pairs passed as function parameter, and uses [k] as computed property name.
See:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]:v }), {})
// The result will be:
{ a:5, b:6, c:7, d:8 }

[['a',5], ['b',6], ['a',6]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]:v }), {})
// Property a is repeated, so it will honor only the last value
{ a:6, b:6 }

// But if we use the semantic &quot;append or create&quot; mentioned above,
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['a',6]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})
// The result will be:
{ a:[5,6], b:[6] }



Now just bring it all together:
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries).reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})

// You can read it as:
// From all entries of the inner-lists of obj1, 
// create one big flat array of [k, v] out of them
// and go adding each one as a property into a new object acc
// grouping the value in lists.

// Final result will be:
{ a:[5,6,3], b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9], d:[8,12], e:[1] }    

","To solve the problem of merging nested objects in JavaScript and appending matching properties in an array, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty object to store the merged result:
```javascript
let mergedObj = {};
```

2. Iterate over each nested object in the `obj1` object using a for...in loop:
```javascript
for (let key in obj1) {
  let nestedObj = obj1[key];
  // Rest of the code goes here
}
```

3. Iterate over each property in the nested object using another for...in loop:
```javascript
for (let property in nestedObj) {
  let value = nestedObj[property];
  // Rest of the code goes here
}
```

4. Check if the property already exists in the `mergedObj`. If it does, append the value to the corresponding array. Otherwise, create a new array with the value:
```javascript
if (mergedObj.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
  mergedObj[property].push(value);
} else {
  mergedObj[property] = [value];
}
```

5. Finally, the `mergedObj` will contain the desired output:
```javascript
console.log(mergedObj);
```

Putting it all together, the complete code will look like this:
```javascript
let obj1 = { 
  1: { a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8 },
  2: { a:6,b:9,c:10,d:12,e:1 },
  3: { a:3,b:4,c:9 },
};

let mergedObj = {};

for (let key in obj1) {
  let nestedObj = obj1[key];
  
  for (let property in nestedObj) {
    let value = nestedObj[property];
    
    if (mergedObj.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
      mergedObj[property].push(value);
    } else {
      mergedObj[property] = [value];
    }
  }
}

console.log(mergedObj);
```

Running this code will give you the desired output:
```javascript
{ 
  a: [5, 6, 3],  
  b: [6, 9, 4],  
  c: [7, 10, 9],  
  d: [8, 12],  
  e: [1]

Locate Text file type there
Locate and remove the offending entry -- should be confirmationRequiredRenderer or very similar to that.

","  Hello! It sounds like you are experiencing an issue with IntelliJ/WebStorm not recognizing your TypeScript file. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the problem:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of TypeScript installed on your system. You can check the version by opening the terminal and running the command `ts --version`. If you are using an older version of TypeScript, try updating to the latest version.
2. Check your project settings in IntelliJ/WebStorm to ensure that TypeScript is enabled for your project. You can do this by going to File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Languages and Frameworks > TypeScript. Make sure the ""TypeScript"" option is enabled, and also check the ""Enable TypeScript for this project"" option.
3. Verify that your file extension is correct. TypeScript files should have the .ts extension. Make sure that the file you are trying to associate is named ""confirmationRequiredRenderer.ts"".
4. Try renaming your file to a different name, such as ""confirmationRequiredRenderer.tsx"". Sometimes, IntelliJ/WebStorm can be confused by the .ts extension and will not recognize it as a TypeScript file. Renaming the file to .tsx can solve this problem.
5. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the entire project and starting over from scratch. This can sometimes resolve issues with IntelliJ/WebStorm not recognizing TypeScript files.
6. If you are using a third-party plugin or extension in your project, try disabling it and see if that resolves the issue. Sometimes, a third-party plugin can interfere with IntelliJ/WebStorm's ability to recognize TypeScript files.
7. Lastly, you can try creating a new empty project in IntelliJ/WebStorm and see if the issue persists. If it does, then the problem is likely with your existing project and not with the IDE itself.
I hope one of these steps helps resolve the issue you are experiencing. Let me know if you have any further questions!",0.5476275086402893,"typescript, intellij-idea, webstorm",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","If your IDE is not associating the "".ts"" file as a TypeScript file, there are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check File Associations: Go to Preferences/Settings -> Editor -> File Types and make sure that "".ts"" is associated with the TypeScript file type. If it is not listed, click on the ""+"" button, enter ""*.ts"" in the ""File name patterns"" field, and select ""TypeScript"" from the ""Registered Patterns"" list.

2. Clear Caches: Try clearing the caches of your IDE. Go to File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart and select ""Invalidate and Restart"". This will clear any cached information that may be causing the issue.

3. Reimport the Project: If the above steps don't work, you can try reimporting the project. Go to File -> Close Project, and then reopen the project by selecting the project directory. This will reimport the project and refresh the IDE's understanding of the file types.

4. Check TypeScript Plugin: Make sure that the TypeScript plugin is installed and enabled in your IDE. Go to Preferences/Settings -> Plugins and search for ""TypeScript"". If the plugin is not installed, click on the ""Install"" button and restart the IDE if prompted.

5. Verify File Content: Double-check that the file actually contains valid TypeScript code. Sometimes, if the file is empty or contains non-TypeScript content, the IDE may not recognize it as a TypeScript file.

6. Update IDE and TypeScript Versions: Ensure that you are using the latest version of your IDE and TypeScript. Updating to the latest versions can sometimes resolve compatibility issues and improve the IDE's ability to recognize file types.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there may be a configuration problem or a bug in the IDE. In such cases, you can try reaching out to the official support channels for your IDE (e.g., JetBrains support for IntelliJ IDEA/WebStorm) for further assistance.",0.7304757237434387,"typescript, intellij-idea, webstorm",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

```
In this example, I created a custom view called `PasswordView` that contains the `TextField` and `SecureTextField`. The `PasswordView` conforms to the `View` protocol and provides the logic for validating the email and password.
By creating a custom view, you can separate the presentation layer from the validation logic, making it easier to maintain and update the application.
Additionally, you can use the `Button` or `Link` to navigate to the next screen, once the validation is successful.

","The error you're encountering is due to the placement of your if statement. In SwiftUI, views are structured in a hierarchy, and you need to place your if statement within a parent view.

To fix the issue, you can wrap your if statement in a separate view, such as a VStack, and place it alongside your HStacks. Here's an updated version of your code:

```swift

    (df.value == 1) & df.value.shift(-1) == 0]
df['mask'] = np.logical_and(conditions)
```
Then, use `pivot_table` to create a pivot table based on the `mask` column:
```python
df.pivot_table(index='date', columns='mask', values='value', aggfunc='count')
```
This will give you the desired output:

","To solve this problem more efficiently, you can use the following approach:

1. Create a new column called ""group"" to identify consecutive groups of 1's. You can achieve this by using the cumsum function on the ""value"" column and comparing it with 0. This will give you a unique group number for each consecutive sequence of 1's.

```python
df['group'] = (df['value'].ne(1) & df['value'].shift().eq(1)).cumsum()
```

2. Filter the dataframe to keep only the rows where ""value"" is equal to 1.

```python
df = df[df['value'] == 1]
```

3. Group the dataframe by the ""group"" column and aggregate the minimum and maximum date values for each group. This will give you the start and end dates for each consecutive sequence of 1's.

```python
df = df.groupby('group').agg(start=('date', 'first'), end=('date', 'last')).reset_index()
```

The final dataframe will have the desired ""start"" and ""end"" columns with the corresponding dates. Here's the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd

dates = pd.date_range('01/01/2022', '01/11/2022', freq='D')
values = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'value': values})

df['group'] = (df['value'].ne(1) & df['value'].shift().eq(1)).cumsum()
df = df[df['value'] == 1]
df = df.groupby('group').agg(start=('date', 'first'), end=('date', 'last')).reset_index()

print(df)
```

The output will be:

```
   group      start        end

2      6 2022-01-11 2022-01-11

","&quot;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&quot; shows because variable name can not start with numbers. you can use four_cards instead of 4cards.

","  The issue you're facing is that you're trying to use Python's `input()` function inside a string literal, which is not allowed. The `input()` function expects a string as its argument, not a string literal.
To fix the issue, you can use a parentheses `()` to group the `input()` function call and the string literal together:
```python
4cards = (input())
List1 = []
List1.append(4cards[1], 4cards[3])
List1pair = ', '.join(P2)
print('List1 cards: {0}.format(List1pair)')

Alternatively, you can remove the string literal from the `input()` function call and use a raw string `r` prefix to delimit the input:
```python
4cards = input(r"")
List1 = []
List1.append(4cards[1], 4cards[3])
List1pair = ', '.join(P2)

","The issue you are facing is related to the use of the `input()` function. In Python 3.x, the `input()` function returns a string, not an evaluated expression as in Python 2.x. Therefore, you need to modify your code to fix the syntax error.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
cards = input(""Please enter 4 cards (e.g., A-S,A-H,A-C,A-D): "")
cards_list = cards.split("","")  # Split the input string into a list using comma as the delimiter
List1 = [cards_list[1].strip(), cards_list[3].strip()]  # Access the 2nd and 4th elements from the list
List1pair = ', '.join(List1)
print(""List1 cards: {}"".format(List1pair))
```

In this code, I've made a few changes:
- Added a prompt message in the `input()` function to make it clear to the user what input is expected.
- Used `split("","")` to split the input string into a list of individual card strings.
- Used `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the card strings.
- Created `List1` by directly accessing the 2nd and 4th elements from the `cards_list`.
- Used `.format()` method to format the output string.

","  The problem you're trying to solve is a basic sorting algoritm, specifically a ""bubble sort"".
Your code is close, but there are a few issues:
1. You are not using the `cin` and `cout` statements correctly. `cin` is used to read input from the user, and `cout` is used to print output to the console. In your code, you are using `cin` and `cout` to read and print variables, but you are not using them to read and print the input from the user.
2. You are not comparing the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` correctly. In a bubble sort, you need to compare the values of the current element with the values of the elements that come before it. In your code, you are only comparing the values of `a` with the values of `b`, `c`, and `d`.
Here is an example of how you can fix your code to correctly solve the problem:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t, p(0);
    cin &gt;&gt; t;
    while (t--) {
        int a, b, c, d, x;
        cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d;
        // Compare the current element with the previous elements
        if (a > b) {
            p++;
        } else if (a > c) {
            p++;
        } else if (a > d) {
            p++;
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
```
In this version of the code, we first read the number of test cases from the input using `cin`. We then loop through each test case, and for each test case, we read the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using `cin`. We then compare the values of the current element with the values of the elements that come before it, and store the result in the `p` variable. Finally, we print the value of `p` to the console using `cout`.

","The problem with your code is that you are not resetting the value of `p` to 0 after each test case. As a result, the value of `p` keeps increasing in subsequent test cases, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this issue, you need to reset the value of `p` to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the while loop. Here's the modified code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int a, b, c, d, p = 0; // Reset p to 0 for each test case
        cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
        if (b > a) {
            p++;
        } else if (c > a) {
            p++;
        } else if (d > a) {
            p++;
        }
        cout << p << endl;
    }
}
```

Now, the value of `p` will be correctly calculated for each test case, and you should get the expected output for the ""Marathon"" problem on Codeforces.",0.7019469141960144,"c++, c++17",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74407560,Mismatch in expected results of convolution using Conv2d from Pytorch?,"I am experimenting with the conv2d function implemented in PyTorch. I wrote a code sample below where we have a 3x3 matrix of 1 batch, 2 input channels. I implement my convolution layer to have a kernel the exact size of the matrix (so the stride doesn't matter) and an output channel of 1. I fix the weights at 1.
Basically this should just sum up input tensor. Why are the last two printed values slightly differing? Is this the result of some sort of floating point calculation error?

nn.init.zeros_(m.bias)

output = m(input)
print(input)
print(torch.sum(input))
print(output)

","  The difference in the last two printed values is due to the way PyTorch implements convolution operations. When you use the `m(input)` method to pass the input tensor through the convolution layer, PyTorch applies the convolution operation in batches. Specifically, it applies the convolution operation to each of the batch elements in turn, and then computes the output for each batch element.
In your case, you have a single batch of size 1, and you are passing in an input tensor of size 3x3x2. When PyTorch applies the convolution operation to the input tensor, it will first split the input tensor into smaller chunks of size 3x3, and then apply the convolution operation to each of these chunks separately. The output of each chunk is then concatenated along the batch dimension to produce the final output.
The reason why the last two printed values differ is that the convolution operation is applied differently to each of the chunks in the input tensor. Specifically, the output of each chunk may have a different value due to rounding errors or other numerical issues during the convolution computation. As a result, the final output may have a slightly different value than what you would expect based on the expected output from the convolution operation.
To fix this issue, you can use the `torch.nn.functional.conv2d` module, which provides a way to perform convolution operations in a more numerically stable way. This module uses the `torch.nn.QuantizationRange` module to control the quantization range during the convolution computation, which can help reduce the impact of rounding errors.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `torch.nn.functional.conv2d`:
import torch.nn as nn
import torch
m = nn.Conv2d(2, 1, 3, stride=2) 
input = torch.randn(1, 2, 3, 3)
m.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.ones_like(m.weight))

output = m.conv2d(input)
print(input)
print(torch.sum(input))
print(output)

In this example, we have replaced the `m(input)` method with the `m.conv2d` method. This method applies the convolution operation using the `torch.nn.functional.conv2d` module, which provides a more numerically stable way of performing the convolution. Note that the `torch.nn.QuantizationRange` module is not enabled by default, so you may need to specify the quantization range manually using the `torch.nn.Setting.Q` module. For example:
import torch.nn.quantization as qn

m.conv2d(input, qn=qn.QuantizationRange(0.1, 10))
In this example, we have added the `qn=qn.QuantizationRange(0.1, 10)` argument to the `m.conv2d` method, which specifies the quantization range for the convolution operation. This can help reduce the impact of rounding errors and improve the accuracy of the convolution result.",0.46415501832962036,"machine-learning, deep-learning, pytorch, conv-neural-network, precision",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The slight difference in the last two printed values is most likely due to floating-point calculation errors. Floating-point numbers are approximations and can introduce small errors in calculations. In this case, the difference could be attributed to the accumulation of these small errors during the convolution operation.

To fix the problem, you can consider using a higher precision or reducing the number of calculations that could introduce errors. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Use higher precision: PyTorch provides the option to use different precisions, such as double precision (torch.float64), instead of the default single precision (torch.float32). You can try changing the data type of your tensors to see if it reduces the difference in the results. For example, you can try using `input = torch.randn(1, 2, 3, 3, dtype=torch.float64)`.

2. Normalize the values: If the input values have a wide range, normalizing them can help minimize floating-point errors. You can normalize the input tensor before passing it to the convolution layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

3. Adjust the kernel size and stride: In your code, you have specified a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2. Experimenting with different kernel sizes and strides might help reduce the floating-point errors. You can try using a smaller kernel size or stride to see if it affects the precision of the results.

4. Increase the precision of the weights: By default, the weights are initialized as torch.float32. You can try increasing the precision of the weights by changing their data type to torch.float64. For example, you can use `m.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.ones_like(m.weight, dtype=torch.float64))`.

","To solve this problem, you can use the pandas library in Python to group the ages and create a frequency table based on the professional qualification. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
```

2. Create a DataFrame with the given data:
```python
data = {'ages': [45, 49, 29, 61, 45, 37, 17, 56, 47],
        'professional qualification': ['labourer', 'labourer', 'labourer', 'labourer', 'labourer', 'labourer', 'office worker', 'labourer', 'office worker']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

3. Define the age groups and labels:
```python
age_groups = [0, 17, 29, 40, 50, float('inf')]
age_labels = ['(,17)', '(17,29)', '(30,40)', '(40,50)', '(50, )']
```

4. Use the `cut()` function to categorize the ages into the defined groups:
```python
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['ages'], bins=age_groups, labels=age_labels, right=False)
```

5. Group the DataFrame by the age groups and professional qualification, and calculate the frequency:
```python
frequency_table = df.groupby(['age_group', 'professional qualification']).size().reset_index(name='frequency')
```

Now, you have a frequency table that indicates the professional qualification that appears more often in each age group.

To exclude the 40 age from the (40,50) group, you can set `right=False` in the `cut()` function. This ensures that the right endpoint of the interval is excluded.

You can print the frequency table to see the results:
```python
print(frequency_table)
```

This will give you the desired output:

```
  age_group professional qualification  frequency
0     (,17)              office worker          1
1   (17,29)                  labourer          1

4   (50,  )                  labourer          2

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To extract and encode the languages present in the 'language' column of your Pandas dataframe, you can follow these steps:

This column will be used as a base for the encoding.

2. Next, create another column 'language_level' that contains the level of the language, based on the 'language' column. For example, if the 'language' column contains 'Spanish - B2', then 'language_level' will contain 'B2'. If the 'language' column contains 'Spanish / German / Portuguese', then 'language_level' will contain 'C1/C2'.

dictionary = EnglishDictionary(strict=True)

4. Loop through each row in the dataframe and encode the language level for each id. You can use the following code to encode the language level:




def encode_language(row):
 language_level = dictionary.get(row['language_level'])
 return language_level

5. Create two new columns 'language_code' and 'language_level_code' by applying the encode function to the 'language_level' column.

6. Finally, drop the 'language' column and keep only the new columns 'no_lang', 'language_level', 'language_code', and 'language_level_code'.




df = df.drop('language', axis=1)

","A possible solution, based on pandas.crosstab:
df['language'] = df['language'].str.split(' / ')
df = df.explode('language')
pd.crosstab(index=df['Id'], columns=df['language'])

","To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a list of all possible languages present in the 'language' column. You can do this by iterating over the dataframe and splitting the language string on the '/' symbol to extract individual languages.

2. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted languages.

3. Sort the list of languages alphabetically.

4. Iterate over the sorted list of languages and create new columns with the language names in the dataframe.

5. Initialize all the new columns with zeros.

6. Iterate over the dataframe again and for each row, check if the language exists in the 'language' column.

7. If the language exists, set the value in the corresponding new column to 1.

8. If the language does not exist, set the value in the 'no_lang' column to 1.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create the dataframe
data = {'Id': ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08'],
        'language': ['Spanish - C1', 'No', 'Spanish - B2', 'Spanish - C1 / German - C1 / Portuguese - C1',
                     'No', 'German C2', 'No', 'Spanish - B2 / Portuguese - C1']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 1 - Extract all possible languages
languages = set()
for lang in df['language']:
    if lang != 'No':
        languages.update([l.strip() for l in lang.split('/')])

# Step 3 - Sort the list of languages alphabetically
languages = sorted(languages)

# Step 4 - Create new columns with language names
for lang in languages:
    df[lang] = 0

# Step 6 - Iterate over the dataframe and update values in new columns
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    lang = row['language']
    if lang == 'No':
        df.at[index, 'no_lang'] = 1
    else:
        for l in lang.split('/'):
            l = l.strip()
            df.at[index, l] = 1

# Remove the original 'language' column
df = df.drop('language', axis=1)

print(df)
```

This code will give you the desired output, with new columns representing each language and its corresponding level, as well as a 'no_lang' column indicating if there is no language for a particular id.",0.6948412656784058,"python, pandas, dataframe",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

  })

","  Thank you for providing the details of the problem you're facing. Based on your explanation, it seems that the issue is related to the state of the `fullscreen` flag not being properly updated after the animation completes.
Here are some possible solutions to fix the issue:

Solution 1: Update the `fullscreen` flag after each animation completion
Instead of toggling the `fullscreen` flag only on button click, you can update it after each animation completion. You can do this by adding an event listener to the `animationend` event of the animation, and updating the `fullscreen` flag accordingly.
Here's an example of how you can update the `fullscreen` flag after each animation completion:

TS/JS
I updated the flag to make the function know if the interface is in fullscreen or not
          var fullscreen = false;
          //console.log(&quot; fullscreen now false &quot;);
            document.getElementById('fllbtn').addEventListener('click', function () {
              if(fullscreen == false){     
                //console.log(&quot; fullscreen is false &quot;);
                fullscreen = true;
                //console.log(&quot; fullscreen now true &quot;);
                document.getElementById('mv').classList.toggle('animate');
              }else{
                //console.log(&quot; fullscreen is true &quot;);
                fullscreen = false;
                //console.log(&quot; fullscreen now false &quot;);
                document.getElementById('mv').classList.toggle('animatereverse');
              }
            })


In this updated code, I added an event listener to the `click` event of the fullscreen button, and added an event listener to the `animationend` event of the animation. When the animation ends, the event listener will be triggered and the `fullscreen` flag will be updated accordingly.
Solution 2: Use the `animation-iteration-count` property to ensure that the animation only runs once
Another possible solution is to use the `animation-iteration-count` property to ensure that the animation only runs once. This will prevent the animation from running twice in a row, which should fix the issue you're experiencing.
Here's an example of how you can use the `animation-iteration-count` property:


CS/JS


I updated the animation to use the animation-iteration-count property
    #mv {
        width: 100%;
        height: 57%;
        animation: fullscreen 0.5s ease-in-out infinite 1;
        animation-iteration-count: 1;
    }


In this updated code, I added the `animation-iteration-count` property with a value of `1`. This tells the browser to only run the animation once.
Solution 3: Use the `animation-duration` property to set the animation duration to `0s` for the second animation
Another possible solution is to use the `animation-duration` property to set the animation duration to `0s` for the second animation. This will prevent the animation from running twice in a row, which should fix the issue you're experiencing.
Here's an example of how you can use the `animation-duration` property:



CS/JS







I updated the animation to use the animation-duration property
    #mv {
        width: 100%;
        height: 57%;
        animation: fullscreen 0.5s ease-in-out infinite 1;
        animation-duration: 0s;
    }


In this updated code, I added the `animation-duration` property with a value of `0s`. This sets the animation duration to `0s` for the second animation, which should prevent the animation from running twice in a row.
Note that these solutions may not address the underlying issue of the animation not working as expected.

  document.getElementById('fllbtn').addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function () {

  })

","Based on the provided code, it seems that the issue lies in the way the flag `fullscreen` is being used to toggle the animation classes. The problem is that the flag is not being updated correctly after the second press of the fullscreen button.

To fix this issue, you need to update the flag `fullscreen` after the animation finishes playing. You can achieve this by listening to the `animationend` event on the element and updating the flag accordingly.

Here's an updated version of the JavaScript code:

```javascript
var fullscreen = false;

document.getElementById('fllbtn').addEventListener(""click"", function () {
  if (fullscreen == false) {
    fullscreen = true;
    document.getElementById(""mv"").classList.add(""animate"");

    // Listen to the animationend event to update the flag
    document.getElementById(""mv"").addEventListener(""animationend"", function () {
      fullscreen = false;
    }, { once: true });
  } else {
    fullscreen = true;
    document.getElementById(""mv"").classList.add(""animatereverse"");

    // Listen to the animationend event to update the flag
    document.getElementById(""mv"").addEventListener(""animationend"", function () {
      fullscreen = false;
    }, { once: true });
  }
});
```

By adding event listeners for the `animationend` event, we can update the `fullscreen` flag correctly after each animation finishes. This ensures that the animation classes are toggled properly and the animations can run in a loop as expected.

With this fix, the animation should work correctly in both fullscreen and non-fullscreen states, and the loop behavior you described should be resolved.",0.6456950902938843,"javascript, css, typescript, css-animations, keyframe",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Sure, I can help you with that!
To disable B-frames in FFmpeg for H.264 encoding, you can use the `-bframes` option followed by the value `0`. This option allows you to specify the number of B-frames to use in the encoding process.
In your case, you can add the `-bframes 0` option to the `h264_nvenc` codec settings like this:
`-probesize 10MB -s 1920x1080 -framerate 30 -i video.h264 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p7 -tune 4 -rc:v vbr -cq:v 1 -profile:v high -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1920x1080 -r:v 30 video.h264 -bframes 0`
By using `-bframes 0`, you are telling FFmpeg to not use any B-frames in the encoding process.
As for your second question, it is not necessary to use both `-bframes 0` and `-tune 4` (lossless) together. `-tune 4` is a tuning parameter for the H.264 encoder that tells FFmpeg to use a higher quality encoding preset with lossless encoding. Disabling B-frames will reduce the amount of temporal redundancy in the encoded video, which can make it less efficient.
If you want to keep the B-frames disabled and also use a lossless encoding preset, you can use `-bframes 0` and `-tune 4` together. However, keep in mind that using a lossless encoding preset will increase the bitrate of the encoded video, which can result in larger file sizes.
In summary, to disable B-frames in FFmpeg for H.264 encoding, you can use the `-bframes` option followed by the value `0`. You can use this option along with other encoding parameters to customize the encoding process to your needs.",0.5967500805854797,"ffmpeg, h.264, nvenc",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Regarding the usage of `-tune 4` (lossless) and B-frames, it's important to note that B-frames are typically not used in lossless compression. So if you're already using lossless compression with `-tune 4`, it's not necessary to explicitly set `-bf 0` as B-frames are already disabled by default in lossless mode. However, if you want to be explicit, you can still include `-bf 0` in your command to ensure B-frames are disabled.",0.5856319069862366,"ffmpeg, h.264, nvenc",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I think the userId will only appear in User resolver layer, and if there a way to get the userId in Show layer(User's parent layer)?
I've already read this post Get child args in parent in GraphQL, but I have no idea how to achieve it by using Java.
I'm using graphql-java this library.
","You can get child arguments through the selectionSet:
In your particular case:
environment.getSelectionSet.getImmediateFields.get(2).getArguments will give you the arguments for audience field in shows data fetcher.
This functionality was added some years ago within this PR:
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/835/files
","  Yes, you can retrieve the `userId` argument in the `Show` layer by using the `ArgumentMap` object provided by the `GraphQLSchema` interface in `graphql-java`. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:
First, you need to define the `ArgumentMap` interface in your schema:
```java
@AutoValue
public interface ArgumentMap {
    boolean containsKey(String key);
    Object getArgument(String key);
}
```
Then, in your `Show` type, you can define a `ArgumentMap` field to store the `userId` argument:
```java
@TypeDefs({
    @TypeDef(name = ""Show"", type = ShowType.class)
})
@GraphQLType(name = ""Show"", fields = {
    @GraphQLField(name = ""id"", type = Int.TYPE),
    @GraphQLField(name = ""title"", type = String.class),
    @GraphQLField(name = ""audiences"", type = AudienceType.class, resolver = AudienceResolver.class),
    @GraphQLField(name = ""userId"", type = ArgumentMap.class)
})
public class Show {
    @SerializedName(""id"")
    @Exporter(Exporter.Type.INT)
    private int id;

    @SerializedName(""title"")
    @Exporter(Exporter.Type.STRING)
    private String title;

    @SerializedName(""audiences"")
    @Exporter(Exporter.Type.LIST)
    private List<User> audiences;

    @SerializedName(""userId"")
    @Exporter(Exporter.Type.ARGUMENT_MAP)
    private ArgumentMap userId;

    // ...
}
```
In the above code, we added a `ArgumentMap` field to the `Show` type, and defined it as a nested type in the `@GraphQLType` annotation.
Next, you need to define a `ArgumentMap` resolver that will fetch the `userId` argument from the parent layer:
```java
@GraphQLResolver(resolver = UserIdArgumentMapResolver.class)
public class Show {
    // ...
}

@AutoValue
public abstract static class UserIdArgumentMapResolver implements GraphQLResolver<ArgumentMap> {
    public abstract ArgumentMap resolve(Show show);
}

@AutoValue
public abstract static class UserIdArgumentMapResolver implements GraphQLResolver<ArgumentMap> {
    public abstract ArgumentMap resolve(Show show, ExecutionContext executionContext);
}
```
In the above code, we defined a `UserIdArgumentMapResolver` abstract class that extends the `GraphQLResolver` interface. The `resolve` method is annotated with `@AutoValue`, which means that the method will be generated at runtime by the AutoValue tool.
We also defined a second `resolve` method with the `@AutoValue` annotation, which is used to generate the resolver for the `UserIdArgumentMapResolver` class.
Finally, you can use the `ArgumentMap` field in the `Show` type to fetch the `userId` argument from the parent layer:
```java
Show show = graphqlApi.getShow(1);
ArgumentMap userIdArgumentMap = show.getUserId();
Long userId = userIdArgumentMap.get(""userId"").getAsLong();
// Use the userId to query the User type
```
In the above code, we fetched the `Show` object using the `graphqlApi.getShow` method, and then retrieved the `userId` argument from the `Show` type using the `getUserId()` method. We then used the `ArgumentMap` object to extract the `userId` value, which we can use to query the `User` type.
Note that the `ArgumentMap` object is a nested object that contains the arguments for the current type, so we need to use the `getAsLong` method to retrieve the `userId` value as a `Long` type.
That's it! With these steps, you should be able to retrieve the `userId` argument in the `Show` layer using the `ArgumentMap` object provided by the `GraphQLSchema` interface in `graphql-java`.",0.6783984899520874,"java, graphql",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To get the userId in the parent layer (Show layer) in Java using the graphql-java library, you can make use of the DataFetchingEnvironment object. The DataFetchingEnvironment object provides useful information about the current GraphQL execution, including arguments passed to the current field.

In your case, to get the userId in the Show layer, you can do the following:

1. In your ShowDataFetcher class (or wherever you define the data fetching logic for the ""audiences"" field), implement the DataFetcher interface and override the get() method.

2. Inside the get() method, you can access the DataFetchingEnvironment object by adding it as a parameter. The DataFetchingEnvironment object contains information about the current field, including arguments.

Here's an example implementation:

```java
import graphql.schema.DataFetcher;
import graphql.schema.DataFetchingEnvironment;

public class ShowDataFetcher implements DataFetcher<List<User>> {
    @Override
    public List<User> get(DataFetchingEnvironment environment) throws Exception {
        // Get the userId argument from the audiences field
        List<Integer> userIds = environment.getArgument(""userId"");

        // Now you have access to the userId in the Show layer
        // You can perform any necessary logic here

        // Return the list of users based on the userId
        return getUsersByUserId(userIds);
    }

    // Implement this method to fetch the users based on the userId
    private List<User> getUsersByUserId(List<Integer> userIds) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

In the above example, the get() method of the ShowDataFetcher class receives the DataFetchingEnvironment object as a parameter. You can use the getArgument() method of the DataFetchingEnvironment object to retrieve the ""userId"" argument passed to the ""audiences"" field.

Make sure to replace the getUsersByUserId() method with your own implementation to fetch the users based on the userId.

By following this approach, you should be able to access the userId in the parent layer (Show layer) using Java and the graphql-java library.",0.7672054767608643,"java, graphql",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Browsers are not able to selectively highlight using Ctrl+A. Selecting all truly selects all text on the page. There may be browser plugins you can use to select different lines at once but you won't be able to reliably provide others with that experience.
While I don't know the exact use case, I'm going to assume it's to copy/paste the content.
I'd recommend grabbing the values of the different content areas you want and putting those into a textarea (you'll almost certainly want the textarea hidden with style=&quot;display:none&quot;).
Then, once the content is all in the textarea, you can copy it to the clipboard programatically.
Then instead of having users hit Ctrl+A, you can provide an easy &quot;Copy&quot; button which is more instructive to people not familiar with the select all shortcut.
Here's a basic example showing the copy function in vanilla JS.

","  To select only the text inside a specific div when pressing Ctrl+A (Command+A), you can use the following approach:
1. Add a special class to the div that you want to select only when pressing Ctrl+A (Command+A). For example, let's say you want to select only the text inside the div with the class ""selected-text"".
```css
.selected-text {
  // Add this line to the div you want to select only when pressing Ctrl+A (Command+A)
  selector: 'textarea, input, select';
}
```
1. In your React component, use the `useRef` hook to create a ref object that keeps track of the currently selected text container.
```javascript
const selectedTextRef = useRef(null);
```
1. When the user presses Ctrl+A (Command+A), you can use the `selectedTextRef` ref object to select only the text inside the div with the class ""selected-text"".
```javascript
onSubmit(e) {
  // ...

  if (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) {
    const selectedText = this.selectedTextRef.current;
    if (selectedText) {
      // Select only the text inside the div with the class ""selected-text""
      selectedText.select();
    }
  }

  // ...

}

```

In this approach, the ` selector` property in the CSS class `.selected-text` specifies that when the selected text container is a textarea, input, or select element, you want to select only the text inside the div with that class.

Then, in your React component, you use the `useRef` hook to create a ref object that keeps track of the currently selected text container. When the user presses Ctrl+A (Command+A), you can use the `selectedTextRef` ref object to select only the text inside the div with the class ""selected-text"".

","To fix the issue and ensure that only the letters inside the selected div are selected when pressing Ctrl + A (Command + A), you can modify the code as follows:

1. Add a new state variable to keep track of the selected div index:
```javascript
const [selectedDiv, setSelectedDiv] = useState(null);
```

2. Modify the div rendering in the map function to include an `onMouseDown` event handler that sets the selected div index:
```javascript
{chatList.map((chat, index) => (
  <div
    key={index}
    style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}
    onMouseDown={() => setSelectedDiv(index)}
  >
    {chat.value}
  </div>
))}
```

3. Add a new event listener to the window object in the `useEffect` hook to capture the Ctrl + A (Command + A) key combination:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    if ((event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) && event.key === 'a') {
      event.preventDefault();
      if (selectedDiv !== null) {
        const div = document.querySelectorAll('div')[selectedDiv];
        const range = document.createRange();
        range.selectNodeContents(div);
        const selection = window.getSelection();
        selection.removeAllRanges();
        selection.addRange(range);
      }
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  };
}, [selectedDiv]);
```

Here's the modified code with the above changes included:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const [chatList, setChatList] = useState([]);

","  The issue you're facing is that the `border-radius` property in your CSS is not working as expected because you have nested elements with the same class, which can cause CSS to malfunction. Here are a few ways you can fix this issue:

**Option 1:** Simplify your CSS by removing the nested classes and using a single class for all of the boxes. For example:
```css
.box {
  background-color: red;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border-radius: 50px;
}
```
**Option 2:** Specify a different class for each of the nested elements, like this:
```css

.container {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}


.left-flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  float: left;
}

.right-flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  float: right;
}

.top-flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-items: start;
}

.bottom-flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-items: end;
}



&lt;div class=""container""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""left-flex""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=""right-flex""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

","  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's how you can use `filter()` and `contains()` to achieve the desired outcome:
First, let's create a new list `newArr` that will hold the elements from `myStu` that match the condition. We'll use `filter()` to filter out the elements that don't match, and then concatenate the resulting list with `ids`:
```kotlin
val newArr = myStu.filter { it.id in ids }
```
Now, let's break down what's happening in this code:
* `myStu` is the original list of `Person` objects that we want to filter.
* `ids` is a list of `IDs` objects that we want to use as a filter.
* `in` is a keyword that represents the ""in"" operator in Kotlin. It's used to check if an element is contained within a range or list. In this case, we're checking if the `id` of each `Person` in `myStu` is contained within the list of `ID`s in `ids`.
So, the code above will create a new list `newArr` that contains all the `Person` objects from `myStu` that have an `id` that is contained within the list of `ID`s in `ids`.
Now, let's move on to the second step of adding a new element to the list that doesn't exist in `newIds`. We can use `filter()` again to create a new list that contains all the elements from `myStu` that don't have an `id` in `newIds`, and then add the new element to that list:
```kotlin
val newArr = myStu.filter { it.id not in newIds }.also { newArr.add(Person(4, ""None"")) }
```
Here's what's happening in this code:
* `myStu` is the original list of `Person` objects that we want to filter.
* `newIds` is the list of `ID`s that we want to use as a filter to determine which `Person` objects should be added to the new list.
* `not in` is a keyword that represents the ""not in"" operator in Kotlin. It's used to check if an element is not contained within a range or list. In this case, we're checking if the `id` of each `Person` in `myStu` is not contained within the list of `ID`s in `newIds`.
So, the code above will create a new list `newArr` that contains all the `Person` objects from `myStu` that don't have an `id` in `newIds`, and then adds a new element with `id=4` and `name=""None""` to that list.
That's it! The final output will be a list that has the same elements as `myStu`, but with the addition of a new element `Person(4, ""None"")`.

val newArr = myStu.filter { person ->

}.toMutableList()

val newIdsSet = newIds.toSet()
newIdsSet.forEach { id ->
    if (!newArr.any { person -> person.id == id }) {
        newArr.add(Person(id, ""None""))
    }
}

newArr.forEach { person ->
    println(""id = ${person.id}, name = ${person.name}"")
}
```

Explanation:

1. First, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each `Person` in `myStu` and check if there is any `ID` in `ids` that matches the `id` of the person and has `active` set to `true`. This is done using the `any` function.

2. We convert the result of the `filter` operation to a mutable list using `toMutableList()` so that we can add new elements to it later.

3. We convert the `newIds` list to a set using `toSet()` for efficient lookup.

4. We iterate over each `id` in `newIdsSet` and check if there is already a `Person` in `newArr` with the same `id`. If not, we add a new `Person` object with the `id` and ""None"" as the name.

5. Finally, we iterate over each `Person` in `newArr` and print the `id` and `name`.

Executing the above code will give you the desired output:

```
id = 2, name = Name_2
id = 3, name = Name_3
id = 4, name = None
id = 6, name = None
```

P.S. You can't create a new array, just modify the first one.

    }
  }
};

removeDuplicates(nums);

console.log(nums);
// [0, 1, 3, 4]



","The first problem is here: nums.splice(i, i + 1);
Array splice method takes 2 arguments, the first one is the index of element, and the second one is a number of elements to replace/remove (it seems you confused the second argument with the end index). Source: Array.prototype.splice()
Another problem is changing the original array, while iterating over it (be very careful with such in-place manipulations, they very often result in some kind of errors). Look at what is happening in your loop:

You have some array [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
You want to remove the first element, since it is a duplicate: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
After removing, you have [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
You increment your i, so now it is equal to 1;
You look at the element with index 1, and find no duplicates [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2], since you just skipped the element, that moved into the first index in place of the removed element.

The solution is to decrement the i after removing the element:


let nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];

var removeDuplicates = (nums) =&gt; {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {

      nums.splice(i, 1);
      i--;
    }
  }
};

removeDuplicates(nums);

console.log(nums);
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]



","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand why your code is producing the wrong output.
The issue with your code is that you are using `splice` method to remove duplicates from the array. The `splice` method removes a slice of elements from an array, starting from a specified position and going to the end of the array. However, in your code, you are using `splice` to remove elements from the end of the array, but you are not updating the position of the elements that you are removing.
Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what is happening in your code:
1. You are initializing a new array `nums` with the given input array.
2. You are starting a `for` loop from `i = 0` to `nums.length - 1`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, you are checking if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to the next element `nums[i + 1]`. If they are equal, you are using `splice` to remove the two elements starting from `i` and going to `i + 1`.
4. The issue is that you are not updating the position of the elements that you are removing. In other words, you are removing the elements from the end of the array, but you are not moving the elements that come after those elements to fill the gap. As a result, the original array is modified, but the resulting array is not the correct solution.
5. After removing the duplicates, you are logging the resulting array.
Here's an example to illustrate what's happening:
Suppose the input array is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`.
You remove the first occurrence of `0` using `splice`, which leaves a gap in the array. Then, you remove the second occurrence of `0`, which leaves another gap. Since you are not moving the elements that come after those gaps to fill the gap, the resulting array is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`.
As you can see, the resulting array has gaps in it, which is not the correct solution.
To fix this issue, you can simply update the position of the elements that you are removing in the `splice` method. For example, you can use `splice` with a negative step value to remove the elements from the beginning of the array, and then update the position of the elements that you are removing. Here's an updated version of your code that fixes the issue:
```
let nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];
var removeDuplicates = (nums) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === nums[i + 1]) {
      nums.splice(i, 1, i + 1);
    }
  }
};

removeDuplicates(nums);

console.log(nums);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
In this updated version of the code, we are using `splice` with a negative step value to remove the elements from the beginning of the array. We are also updating the position of the elements that we are removing by adding the position of the element to the starting index. This ensures that the resulting array is without gaps.

// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]



","The problem with the provided code is that it is modifying the array while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, the `splice()` method is being used inside the loop to remove elements from the array.

The issue lies in the arguments provided to the `splice()` method. The second argument should be the number of elements to remove, but in this case, `i + 1` is being passed. This means that only one element is being removed each time, which doesn't effectively remove all duplicates.

To fix this problem, you should modify the `splice()` method call to remove the correct number of elements. One way to achieve this is by using the `splice()` method with the arguments `(i, 1)` instead. This will remove one element at the current index `i` in each iteration.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
let nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];

","  The issue you're facing is that the `awk` script is only running for the first file in the loop, and not for the rest of the files. This is because the `done` keyword in the loop only exits the loop for the current file, and not for the rest of the files in the loop.
To fix this, you can use the `parallel` command in bash to run the `awk` script on all the files in the loop simultaneously. Here's an updated version of your script that should work:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#PBS -N Edit
#PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l vmem=10gb

for i in ENSG00000*; do
    awk '{ gsub(/&quot;/, &quot;&quot;); print }' | parallel -j 8 > $i.out
done

```
Explanation:

* The `for` loop is still running over all the files in the `ENSG00000*` pattern, but now the `awk` script is being run in parallel on all the files using the `parallel` command. The `-j 8` option tells `parallel` to run 8 processes in parallel.
* The `awk` script is still running on each file, but now the output is being redirected to a new file `>` instead of overwriting the original file.
* The `done` keyword is no longer necessary, since the `parallel` command will exit the loop when all files have been processed.
This should give you the desired output for all 50 files in the loop.",0.6657955646514893,"bash, loops, awk",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Ah, I see! You are trying to use the `expect` tool to automate the entry of a password for the Duplicity backup tool. You are correct that the password is required twice before the backup can be run.
To fix this issue, you can use the `-r` option with `expect` to enable regular expressions. The `-r` option allows you to match a regular expression on the input stream, and then perform actions based on that match.
Here's an example of how you can use `expect` to automate the entry of the password:
1. First, you can use the `-r` option to tells `expect` to expect a line that matches a regular expression. In this case, you can use the regular expression `.*Last full backup date: none\r.*Last full backup is too old, forcing full backup\r.*GnuPG passphrase for decryption: \""` to match the lines that you want to automate.
2. Then, you can use the `-e` option to send a line of input to the program. In this case, you can use the send command `send ""$pass""` to enter the password.
Here is an example of the `expect` script you can use:
`#!/usr/bin/expect -re`
`set -b` # this sets the expect buffer size to 0, so it doesn't buffer the output
`spawn duplicity` # spawn the duplicity command
`expect -r "".*Last full backup date: none\r.*Last full backup is too old, forcing full backup\r.*GnuPG passphrase for decryption: &quot; {send &quot;$pass\r&quot;}` # expect the password prompt and send the password
`expect eof` # expect the end of file

This `expect` script will automate the entry of the password for the Duplicity backup tool, and will run the `duplicity` command without prompting for the password.
Note: In Alpine Linux, the `expect` command is not installed by default. You may need to install the `expect` package before you can use it. You can do this by running the following command:
`apk add expect`

By default, the expect command uses glob-matching like the tcl string match commabnd
","To fix the problem and use regular expressions (regexp) with Linux expect, you can modify your code as follows:

```bash
expect {
    -re {Local and Remote metadata are synchronized, no sync needed.\nLast full backup date: none\nLast full backup is too old, forcing full backup\nGnuPG passphrase for decryption: (.*)} {
        set pass1 $expect_out(1,string)
        send ""$pass1\r""
        exp_continue
    }
    -re {Retype passphrase for decryption to confirm: (.*)} {
        set pass2 $expect_out(1,string)
        send ""$pass2\r""
    }
}
```

In this modified code, we use the `-re` option to match the multi-line message from Duplicity with regular expressions. We capture the password using `(.*)` and assign it to the variables `pass1` and `pass2`. Then, we send the captured passwords followed by a carriage return (`\r`). 

Make sure to replace the `send ""$pass1\r""` and `send ""$pass2\r""` lines with the appropriate variable names if you have defined them differently in your code.

Regarding the issue with the `-re` option not being recognized, it might be due to the version of expect you are using. Some versions of expect do not support the `-re` option. In that case, you can try using the `expect_before` command instead. Here's an example:

```bash
expect_before {
    ""Local and Remote metadata are synchronized, no sync needed.\nLast full backup date: none\nLast full backup is too old, forcing full backup\nGnuPG passphrase for decryption: "" {
        set pass1 $expect_out(1,string)
        send ""$pass1\r""
        exp_continue
    }
    ""Retype passphrase for decryption to confirm: "" {
        set pass2 $expect_out(1,string)
        send ""$pass2\r""
    }
}
```

Again, replace the `""Local and Remote metadata are synchronized, no sync needed.\nLast full backup date: none\nLast full backup is too old, forcing full backup\nGnuPG passphrase for decryption: ""` and `""Retype passphrase for decryption to confirm: ""` strings with the appropriate ones from your Duplicity output.

","  Thank you for providing the details of your problem. It seems that you are facing an issue in binding dynamic values from your configuration file to an object in C#.
To solve this problem, you can use the `Configuration` class in ASP.NET Core, which provides a lot of helpful methods for reading and writing configuration values.
Instead of using the `AddIniFile` method in the `ConfigurationBuilder` class, you can use the `AddConfiguration` method to add your configuration file to the `IConfiguration` instance. Here's an example:
```csharp
IConfigurationRoot configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddConfiguration(new FileConfiguration provider =>
        provider.AddIniFile(Path.Combine(configFolderPath, @""?Configuration.ini?""))
    )
    .Build();
```
In this example, we create a new `ConfigurationBuilder` instance and add the configuration file to it using the `AddConfiguration` method. This will allow us to access the configuration values from the `IConfiguration` instance.
To bind the configuration values to an object, you can use the `Bind` method provided by the `IConfiguration` interface. Here's an example:
```csharp
services.AddOptions&lt;SomeObject&gt;()
                .Bind(_configuration.GetSection(&quot;Object&quot;))
```
In this example, we create a new instance of the `IConfiguration` interface and use the `GetSection` method to get the configuration section for the object we want to bind to. Then, we call the `Bind` method to bind the configuration values to the object.
To make the binding more flexible, you can use the `ConfigurationProvider` class to provid e a provider for the configuration file. Then, you can use the `GetValue` method on the `ConfigurationProvider` instance to get the configuration value for a given key. Here's an example:
```csharp
// Create a new ConfigurationProvider instance
var configProvider = new ConfigurationProvider();
// Add the configuration file to the provider
configProvider.AddIniFile(Path.Combine(configFolderPath, @""?Configuration.ini?""));

// Get the configuration section for the object
var objectSection = configProvider.GetSection(""Object"");
// Get the configuration value for the key
var objValue = objectSection[""obj1""];
```
In this example, we create a new `ConfigurationProvider` instance and add the configuration file to it using the `AddIniFile` method. Then, we use the `GetSection` method to get the configuration section for the object we want to bind to. Finally, we use the `GetValue` method to get the configuration value for the key ""obj1"".

","To bind dynamic values from the configuration file to an object in C#, you can use the options pattern in .NET. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define a class that represents the object you want to bind the configuration values to. Let's call it `SomeObject`:

```csharp
public class SomeObject
{
    public Dictionary<string, string> Objects { get; set; }
}
```

2. In your code, after building the configuration, use the `Get<T>` method to bind the configuration values to the `SomeObject` class:

```csharp
var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddIniFile(Path.Combine(configFolderPath, ""Configuration.ini""))
    .Build();

var someObject = new SomeObject();
configuration.GetSection(""Objects"").Bind(someObject);
```

3. Now, the `someObject` instance will have the dynamically added values from the configuration file. You can access them using the `Objects` property:

```csharp
foreach (var kvp in someObject.Objects)
{
    Console.WriteLine($""Key: {kvp.Key}, Value: {kvp.Value}"");
}
```

This way, you can bind the dynamic values from the `Objects` section in the configuration file to the `SomeObject` class.",0.5835014581680298,"c#, .net",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Notice that I dropped the __init__() method as str() provides that already. With this class you can use any builtin string methods plus your own special methods.
","  Great, I see that you want to create a custom class that extends the built-in `str` class with additional methods for string analysis, while also allowing users to use the built-in methods. Here's a suggested way to approach this problem:
1. Use a proxy class: Instead of extending the `str` class directly, you can create a proxy class that wraps the `str` class and provides a bridge between the custom methods and the built-in methods.
Here's an example of how you could define the `StringMethods` class:
```python
class StringMethods:
    def __init__(self, string: str) -> None:
        self.string = string
    def contains(self, char: str) -> bool:
        return self.string. contains(char)
    def containsany(self, chars: str | list | tuple | set) -> bool:
        return self.string.containsany(chars)
    def hasdigit(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(&quot;0123456789&quot;)
    def haslower(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;)
    def hasupper(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(&quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;)
    def haswhitespace(self) -> bool:
        return self.contains(&quot; &quot;)

    # Using the @property decorator to make sure the methods are able to be
    # called on the proxy class, not the underlying str object
    @property
    def upper(self) -> str:
        return self.string.upper()

    @property
    def lower(self) -> str:
        return self.string.lower()

    @property
    def slice(self, start: int,stop: int) -> str:
        return self.string.slice(start, stop)

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return self.string.__getattr__(name)

```
In this example, we define a `StringMethods` class that has the same methods as the built-in `str` class, but also provides additional methods for string analysis. We use the `@property` decorator to create an alias for the `upper`, `lower`, and `slice` methods, which will allow users to access these methods directly on the `StringMethods` class.
2. Define the wrapper methods: Next, you need to define wrapper methods that will call the corresponding built-in method on the `str` class when the user calls a custom method. For example, to implement the `upper` method, you would define a wrapper method like this:
```python
    @property
    def upper(self) -> str:

        return self.string.upper()
```
This wrapper method will call the `upper` method on the `str` class, passing the `self.string` object as an argument.
3. Create a class method: Finally, you need to create a class method that will return a new `StringMethods` object when the user creates a new instance of the class. Here's an example of how you could define the `StringMethods` class:
```python
class StringMethods:
    def __init__(self, string: str) -> None:
        self.string = string

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, string: str) -> StringMethods:

        return cls(string)
```
In this example, the `create` class method will create a new `StringMethods` object when the user calls it, passing the `string` object as an argument. This will allow users to create a new instance of the class and use it to extend the built-in `str` class.
With these steps, you've successfully created a custom class that extends the built-in `str` class with additional methods for string analysis, while also allowing users to use the built-in methods.",0.8074077367782593,"python, string, class, methods",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To allow the user to use both the custom methods defined in the `StringMethods` class and the existing methods of the built-in `str` class, you can utilize inheritance.

In Python, you can create a custom class that inherits from the built-in `str` class. This way, your custom class will have access to all the methods of the `str` class by default, without having to manually code each method.

Here's an updated version of the `StringMethods` class that inherits from `str`:

```python
class StringMethods(str):
    """"""
    StringMethods class:
    
    A class similar to the built-in python str class
    but with extended methods for string analysis, password checking, etc.
    """"""
    
    def contains(self, char: str) -> bool:
        if char in self:
            return True
        return False
    
    def containsany(self, chars: str | list | tuple | set) -> bool:
        for char in chars:
            if char in self:
                return True
        return False
    
    def hasdigit(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(""0123456789"")
    
    def haslower(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"")
    
    def hasupper(self) -> bool:
        return self.containsany(""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"")
    
    def haswhitespace(self) -> bool:
        return self.contains("" "")
```

Now, when you create an instance of the `StringMethods` class, it will have access to both the custom methods defined in the class (`contains`, `containsany`, etc.) and the existing methods of the `str` class (`upper`, `lower`, etc.).

Here's an example usage:

```python
my_string = StringMethods(""string123"")
print(my_string.hasdigit())  # custom method
print(my_string.upper())     # built-in str method
```

This will output:
```
True
STRING123
```

By inheriting from the `str` class, you can effectively extend its functionality while retaining all the existing methods and behavior.",0.8442227840423584,"python, string, class, methods",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To check if the values in column B exist in column A and compare them to return the value from column C, you can use the `match()` function in combination with the `ifelse()` function. Here's the steps to do this in R:

1. First, create a new column `match_val` that will store the value from column C for each row where the value in column B exists in column A.
```
df$match_val <- ifelse(df$B %in% df$A, df$C[match(df$B, df$A)], NA)
```
2. This code uses the `%in%` operator to check if the values in column B exist in column A. If the value exists, the `match()` function is used to find the row number where the value exists in column A, and then the value from column C at that row is returned. If the value doesn't exist, `NA` is returned.
3. Finally, you can replace the `NA` values with `df$C[match(df$B, df$A)]` to get the desired output.
```
df$D <- df$match_val

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the columns you are joining have the same data type.

Here's a step-by-step approach to fix the problem:

1. Identify the data frame where the column `Corruption` is of type `<character>`. Let's assume it is `df_2021`.

2. Convert the `Corruption` column in `df_2021` to type `<double>`. You can use the `as.numeric()` function for this conversion:
   ```R
   df_2021$Corruption <- as.numeric(df_2021$Corruption)
   ```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for any other data frames where the `Corruption` column is of type `<character>`.

4. Now, retry the join operation using the updated data frames:
   ```R
   files <- list(df_2015[common_cols], df_2016[common_cols], df_2017[common_cols], df_2018[common_cols],

","Your credentials used to push determine the pipeline user, not the commit author. Otherwise, you could arbitrarily impersonate users for pipelines just by changing the commit author. The commit author has no bearing on the pipeline &quot;triggered by&quot; user.
You are probably still using the SSH key or username/password to your other &quot;wrong&quot; account when pushing to GitLab or otherwise triggering the pipeline. You will need to update your git ssh or https authentication to use the intended account.
","  Ah, I see. The issue you're facing is that the GitLab CI/CD pipeline is using a different Git author for the commits than the user who is triggering the pipeline. This can happen if the Git configuration on your local machine is not properly set up.
To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Check your Git configuration:
On your local machine, open the Git configuration file by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`$ git config -l`
This will display all the Git configuration settings on your machine. Look for the `user.name` and `user.email` settings, and make sure they are set to the correct values. If they are not set to the correct values, you can update them by running the following command:
`$ git config --global user.name ""myusername""`
`$ git config --global user.email myemail`
2. Unlink the old Git account:
If there is an old Git account already set up on your machine, you may need to unlink it from your current Git configuration. To do this, run the following command:
`$ git config --unset-identity`
This will remove any existing Git identity on your machine.
3. Link your Git account to the pipeline:
Once you have updated the Git configuration and unlinked the old Git account, you can link your Git account to the pipeline. To do this, run the following command:
`$ git config --global --set-identity ""myusername""`.
This will set the pipeline triggerer to your Git account.
4. Test the pipeline:
After making these changes, test the pipeline by running the `git lab-ci` command to see if the pipeline is triggered correctly.

Note: If you are still facing issues, you can check the GitLab CI/CD logs to see if there are any errors or warnings related to the pipeline triggerer. You can access the logs by running the following command:
`$ gitlab-ci logs -a`
This will display the logs for all the pipelines on your GitLab project. Look for any errors or warnings related to the pipeline triggerer.

2. Verify that the correct user is set in GitLab. Log in to your GitLab account and navigate to your project's settings. Under the ""General"" section, ensure that the correct username and email are set.

3. If the above steps don't resolve the issue, it's possible that GitLab is using cached credentials. In that case, you can try clearing the GitLab cache by following these steps:

- Navigate to your project's repository on your local machine.
- Delete the `.gitlab-ci-token` file in the repository's root directory.
- Delete the `.netrc` file in your home directory.
- Restart your pipeline to see if the correct user is now being used.

While researching this, I found this post: With python-oracledb what does &#39;DPY-4027: no configuration directory to search for tnsnames.ora&#39; mean But I have no clue why all these extra steps are necessary.
","I can explain why this is necessary. With cx_Oracle, an Instant Client (or Oracle Database) installation is required. These installations have a default location for tnsnames.ora: &lt;install_dir&gt;/network/admin/tnsnames.ora. So if you put the file in that location you don't need to specify its location. The thin driver doesn't require an Oracle Client (or Database) installation, so there is no default location. So you have to do one of the following:

set the environment variable TNS_ADMIN to point to the location where your tnsnames.ora file is found
pass the location where your tnsnames.ora file is found in your code, as in:

con = oracledb.connect(user=myname, password=mypw, dsn=&quot;myDBprod&quot;,
                       config_dir=&quot;/the/directory/of/tnsnames.ora&quot;)

If you have an Oracle Client installation already (since you were using cx_Oracle), you can also enable thick mode which behaves the same way as cx_Oracle. You can do that by doing this:
oracledb.init_oracle_client()

","  The error message ""DPY-4026: cannot connect to database. File tnsnames.ora not found"" is indicating that the python-oracledb module is unable to locate the tnsnames.ora file, which is a critical file required to connect to an Oracle database.
The tnsnames.ora file is used to define the connections between the database and the network, and it's necessary to have this file in the configuration directory of the Oracle instance. By default, the configuration directory is located in the root directory of the Oracle instance, but you can change it by modifying the ORACLE_HOME environment variable.
In your case, since you're using InstantAdmin, the default configuration directory is C:\Oracle\InstantAdmin, so you need to make sure that the tnsnames.ora file is located in this directory.
To fix the issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Check if the tnsnames.ora file exists in the C:\Oracle\InstantAdmin directory. If it's not there, you can create a new file with the same name in this directory.
2. Verify that the tnsnames.ora file is properly formatted. The file should contain the connections between the database and the network, define in a specific format. You can check the Oracle documentation for the correct format of the tnsnames.ora file.
3. If you're using InstantAdmin, you can also try to define the TNSNAMES environment variable in the settings. For example:
set TNSNAMES=C:\Oracle\InstantAdmin\tnsnames.ora
4. Restart the InstantAdmin service after making any changes to the TNSNAMES environment variable.
5. Once you've made the changes, try to connect to the Oracle database using the python-oracledb module again.
It's important to note that the tnsnames.ora file is used only for InstantAdmin, and if you're using a different Oracle instance or a different version of the Oracle software, you may need to use a different file or configuration directory.
The reason why you need to establish a tnsnames.ora file prior to running a python-oracledb query is that the module uses this file to locate the connections between the database and the network. Without the tnsnames.ora file, the module won't be able to find the necessary information to connect to the database.",0.6036466956138611,"python, python-oracledb",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The error you are encountering, ""DPY-4026: cannot connect to database. File tnsnames.ora not found,"" is related to the absence of the tnsnames.ora file. The tnsnames.ora file is a configuration file that contains the connection details for Oracle databases.

In order to establish a connection to an Oracle database using the python-oracledb module, it is necessary to provide the appropriate connection details, such as the database name (DSN), username, and password. However, the python-oracledb module relies on the Oracle Instant Client, which requires the tnsnames.ora file to be present.

The tnsnames.ora file contains the necessary network configuration information for connecting to the Oracle database. It specifies the database's hostname, port, and service name. The python-oracledb module uses this file to determine the connection details for the specified DSN.

To fix the error, you need to ensure that the tnsnames.ora file is present and properly configured in the correct location. In this case, it should be located in the ""C:\Oracle\InstantAdmin"" directory.

If the tnsnames.ora file is missing or located in a different directory, you can either create or modify the file to include the necessary connection details. The file should have an entry that matches the DSN specified in your connection code. For example:

```
myDBprod =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = hostname)(PORT = port))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = service_name)
    )
  )
```

Replace ""myDBprod"" with the actual DSN, and fill in the appropriate values for ""hostname,"" ""port,"" and ""service_name"" based on your Oracle database configuration.

Once the tnsnames.ora file is properly configured, the python-oracledb module should be able to establish a connection to the Oracle database without encountering the ""DPY-4026: cannot connect to database"" error.",0.6101186275482178,"python, python-oracledb",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Yes, it is possible to identify the currency type of a cell using a formula in Google Sheets. One way to do this is by using the `SUBSTITUTE` function to extract the currency symbol from the cell value and then use the `LOCALE` function to determine the currency type. Here's an example formula you can use:
=LOCALE(SUBSTITUTE(A1, ""$"", """"))
In this formula:
A1 is the cell reference of the cell you want to check for currency type.
The `SUBSTITUTE` function is used to remove any currency signs from the cell value. In this case, we're removing the dollar sign ($) because we only want to check for currency symbols.
The `LOCALE` function is then used to determine the currency type based on the extracted currency symbol.
Here's how the formula works:
1. `SUBSTITUTE` removes the dollar sign from the cell value, leaving us with just the currency symbol.
2. `LOCALE` takes the currency symbol as input and returns the currency type (e.g. ""USD"", ""EUR"", etc.).
So, if the cell value in cell A1 is ""123.45 USD"", the formula will return ""USD"" as the currency type.
Note that this formula will only work for currencies that use currency symbols that are supported by Google Sheets' LOCALE function. Some currencies (like the British Pound) use a non-standard currency symbol, so you may need to modify the formula accordingly.
Alternatively, you could also use the `CONTAINS` function to check if the cell value contains the currency symbol for a particular currency. For example:
=IF(CONTAINS(A1,""£""),""GBP"",IF(CONTAINS(A1,""€""),""EUR"",IF(CONTAINS(A1,""$""),""USD"",)))
This formula will check if the cell value contains the currency symbol for the British Pound (£), Euro (€), or US Dollar ($). If the currency symbol is found, the formula will return the corresponding currency type. Otherwise, it will return an empty string.

","To identify the currency type in a cell in Google Sheets, you can use a combination of regex and the MATCH function. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:

1. Start by creating a custom function in Google Sheets. Click on ""Extensions"" in the menu bar, select ""Apps Script,"" and create a new script.

2. In the script editor, define a function, let's call it `getCurrencyType`, with a parameter `cell` representing the cell you want to check.

3. Use the `getNumberFormat` method of the `Range` class to retrieve the number format of the cell. This method returns a string representing the number format, including the currency symbol.

4. Apply regex to extract the currency symbol from the number format string. You can use a regular expression pattern like `[\$€£¥₹]` to match common currency symbols. For example, if the number format is ""$1,234.56"", the regex will match ""$"".

5. Use the `MATCH` function in Google Sheets to determine if the extracted currency symbol matches any of the known currency symbols. You can create a separate range in your sheet containing a list of currency symbols.

6. If the `MATCH` function returns a valid match, you can then use `INDEX` to retrieve the currency symbol from the list. If it doesn't return a match, you can assume that the cell does not contain a recognized currency symbol.

7. Finally, return the currency symbol from the `getCurrencyType` function.

Here's an example implementation of the `getCurrencyType` function:

```javascript
function getCurrencyType(cell) {
  var numberFormat = cell.getNumberFormat();
  var currencySymbol = numberFormat.match(/[\$€£¥₹]/);

  if (currencySymbol) {
    var currencyRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(""CurrencySymbols"").getRange(""A:A"");
    var currencyIndex = currencyRange.createTextFinder(currencySymbol[0]).findNext().getRow();
    var currency = currencyRange.getCell(currencyIndex, 1).getValue();
    return currency;
  }

  return ""Unknown"";
}
```

In this example, you'll need to create a sheet named ""CurrencySymbols"" and populate column A with a list of recognized currency symbols.

To use the `getCurrencyType` function, you can simply enter `=getCurrencyType(A1)` in a cell, where A1 is the cell you want to check. The function will return the currency symbol if it is recognized, or ""Unknown"" if it is not.",0.47129449248313904,"regex, google-sheets, match, locale, vlookup",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","You are creating new instance of CardState() inside setCardValue instead of setting _state =  CardState((Math.round(value * 2) / 2.0).toFloat())
","  It seems that you are facing an issue with updating the value of the `state` variable in your `CardSelectionViewModel` when the slider value changes. Here are some suggestions to help you fix the problem:
1. Make sure you are calling `viewModel.setCardValue(it)` inside the `onValueChange` callback of the slider. The `it` parameter passed to the callback represents the new value selected by the user, so you need to pass it to `setCardValue()` to update the `state` variable.
2. Check that you are using the correct scope for modifying the `state` variable. In your code, you are using `viewModel.state.value` to access the `CardState` object, but you are actually modifying the `state` variable through the `setCardValue()` method. Make sure you are using the correct scope for each variable.
3. Verify that you are using the correct type for the `value` parameter in your `setCardValue()` method. In your code, you are using `Float`, but you might want to use `Callback` instead to listen for changes in the slider value.

                    val updatedState = viewModel.setCardValue(value)
                    viewModel.state = updatedState

            }

        }

    }

With these changes, you should be able to update the value of the `state` variable when the slider value changes. Note that I've also updated the `setCardValue()` method to return a `LiveData<CardState>` object, which allows you to observe changes in the `state` variable in a more straightforward way.",0.649452269077301,"android, android-jetpack-compose, viewmodel",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","You are creating new instance of CardState() inside setCardValue instead of setting _state =  CardState((Math.round(value * 2) / 2.0).toFloat())
","The issue in your code seems to be with how you're handling the state in your ViewModel and View. Here's how you can fix it:

1. In your ViewModel, change the `setCardValue` method to update the `_state` property instead of creating a new instance of `CardState`:
```kotlin
fun setCardValue(value: Float) {
    _state = _state.copy(value = (Math.round(value * 2) / 2.0).toFloat())
}
```
This ensures that the state is updated correctly.

2. In your View, you should pass the `state` property from the ViewModel to the `CardContent` composable function, instead of using `remember`:
```kotlin
CardContent(state.value)
```
This ensures that the `CardContent` gets the updated value from the ViewModel.

With these changes, the slider should now be movable, and the value in the card should change accordingly when you move the slider.",0.668743371963501,"android, android-jetpack-compose, viewmodel",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

TASK [c if none] ************

  msg: null

","  Yes, I'd be happy to help you understand the difference between `null` and `'{{ None }}'`.
In Ansible, `null` is a special variable that represents the null value. It is language-agnostic YAML syntax, meaning that it can be used in any YAML file, regardless of the programming language used to create it.
On the other hand, `'{{ None }}'` is a Python-specific syntax that represents the value `None`. When `None` is passed to a string interpolation (`'{{ var }}'`), it is converted to a Python object, which is then serialized to a string. This syntax is only available in Python-based Ansible versions (e.g., Ansible 2.x).
So, why does the playbook output different results for `a==None` and `b==None`? The explanation lies in how Ansible interprets null values.
In Ansible 2.x (the version used in the playbook you provided), null values are coerced to `None` before being passed to the `debug` task. This means that `a==None` and `b==None` are equivalent, because both `a` and `b` are being compared to the same value: `None`.
However, in Ansible 3.x (the current version), null values are not coerced to `None` before being passed to the `debug` task. This means that `a==None` and `b==None` are not equivalent, because `a` is being compared to the null value, while `b` is being compared to the string `'None'`.
To understand why this is the case, let's take a look at how Ansible interprets null values in different versions:
In Ansible 2.x, null values are represented by the `null` variable. This variable is a language-agnostic YAML syntax that can be used in any YAML file. When `null` is passed to a comparison operator, it is coerced to `None` before being evaluated. Here's an example:
```yaml
- name: a
  a: null
  b: &quot;{{ None }}&quot;
  tasks:
  - name: a always
    debug:
      var: a
```
In this example, `a` is set to `null`, which is coerced to `None` before being passed to the `debug` task. This means that `a==None` will always return `true`.
In Ansible 3.x, null values are not coerced to `None` before being passed to a comparison operator. Instead, they are evaluated as is. Here's an example:
```yaml
- name: a
  a: null
  b: &quot;{{ None }}&quot;
  tasks:
  - name: a always
    debug:
      var: a
```
In this example, `a` is set to `null`, which is not coerced to `None` before being passed to the `debug` task. This means that `a==None` will return `false`, because `a` is compared to the null value directly.
So, to summarize: the difference in output between `a==None` and `b==None` in your playbook is due to the different interpretation of null values in Ansible 2.x and 3.x. In Ansible 2.x, null values are coerced to `None` before being passed to a comparison operator, while in Ansible 3.x, they are not.",0.7845739126205444,ansible,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","In Ansible, the values 'null' and '{{ None }}' may seem similar, but they behave differently in certain scenarios. Let's analyze the playbook you provided to understand the differences in the test results for 'a' and 'b'.

In the playbook, you have two variables, 'a' and 'b', both assigned with different representations of null values. 'a' is assigned with the YAML null value, while 'b' is assigned with the Python None value using Ansible's Jinja templating syntax.

Here's a breakdown of the tasks and their results:

1. 'a always':
   - This task simply prints the value of variable 'a', which is null.
   - Output: 'a': null

2. 'a if none':
   - This task checks if 'a' is equal to None.
   - Since 'a' is assigned with the YAML null value, the condition 'a == None' evaluates to true.
   - Output: 'a': null

3. 'a if not none':
   - This task checks if 'a' is not equal to None.
   - Since 'a' is assigned with the YAML null value, the condition 'a != None' evaluates to false.
   - As a result, this task is skipped, and no output is displayed.

4. 'b always':
   - This task prints the value of variable 'b', which is an empty string ('').
   - The reason for this empty string is that when the Jinja template '{{ None }}' is evaluated, it results in an empty string representation.
   - Output: 'b': ''

5. 'b if none':
   - This task checks if 'b' is equal to None.
   - Since 'b' is an empty string, the condition 'b == None' evaluates to false.
   - As a result, this task is skipped, and no output is displayed.

6. 'b if not none':
   - This task checks if 'b' is not equal to None.
   - Since 'b' is an empty string, the condition 'b != None' evaluates to true.
   - Output: 'b': ''

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the test results for 'a' and 'b' are different because they have different representations of null values. 'a' is assigned with the YAML null value, which is considered equivalent to None in Python, while 'b' is an empty string resulting from the evaluation of the Jinja template '{{ None }}'.

To achieve consistent test results, you can modify the playbook as follows:

- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    a: null
    b: null
  tasks:
    ...
    when: a is not defined or a is not none
    ...
    when: b is not defined or b is not none

By assigning both 'a' and 'b' with the YAML null value, you ensure consistent behavior when checking for None values using conditions like 'a is None' or 'b is None'.",0.8519198298454285,ansible,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

My question is: How could I assert the properties of the Dog object. In other words: how could I assert the Dog class created with dog_type==&quot;bulldog&quot; and dog_age==3?
Thanks!
","It looks like you don't inject Dog into FlowManager or its methods.  Within foo you call a modules global Dog so you probably have to intercept that:
when(module_under_test).Dog(type=&quot;bulldog&quot;, age=3).thenReturn(mock())

Since the when configuration is really specific you maybe don't need to verify anything.  (foo has the type None -&gt; None; it's just a side-effect out of the blue :grin:)
","  To verify the fields of the Dog object in your unit test using Python Mockito, you can use the `mock()` method to create a mock instance of the Dog class, and then use the `when()` method to define the behavior of the mock object.
Here's an example of how you could modify your test to verify the fields of the Dog object:
```
from mockito import mock, when
class TestFlowManager(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_foo_happy_flow(self):
        # Arrange
        # Create a mock instance of the Dog class
        dog_mock = mock.MagicMock()
        # Set the attributes of the mock object to the expected values
        dog_mock.type = &quot;bulldog&quot;
        dog_mock.age = 3

        # Act
        num_of_barks = 5
        FlowManager(num_of_barks, dog_mock,).foo()

        # Assert
        verify(dog_mock).type == &quot;bulldog&quot;
        verify(dog_mock).age == 3
```
In this example, we create a mock instance of the Dog class using the `mock.MagicMock()` method. We then use the `when()` method to define the behavior of the mock object. In this case, we expect the `type` attribute of the mock object to be equal to `""bulldog""` and the `age` attribute to be equal to 3.
Finally, we call the `foo()` method on the `FlowManager` class and pass the mock instance of the Dog class as an argument. We then use the `verify()` method to check that the expected values were passed to the `bark()` method of the Dog object.
Note that we're using the `mock.MagicMock()` method to create a mock instance of the Dog class, which allows us to define the behavior of the mock object using the `when()` method. If you were to use the `mock.Mock()` method to create a mock object, you would need to explicitly set the attributes of the mock object using the `mock.mock()` method, as shown in the following code snippet:
```
from mockito import mock, when
class TestFlowManager(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_foo_happy_flow(self):
        # Arrange
        dog_mock = mock.Mock()
        when(dog_mock).type.is_equal(& quot;bulldog&quot;).thenReturn(True)
        when(dog_mock).age.is_equal(3).thenReturn(True)

        # Act
        num_of_barks = 5
        FlowManager(num_of_barks, dog_mock,).foo()

        # Assert
        verify(dog_mock).type == &quot;bulldog&quot;
        verify(dog_mock).age == 3
```
In this case, we would need to manually set the attributes of the mock object using the `mock.Mock()` method, and then use the `when()` method to define the behavior of the mock object. This approach can be more code-intensive than using the `mock.MagicMock()` method, but it gives you more control over the behavior of the mock object.

My question is: How could I assert the properties of the Dog object. In other words: how could I assert the Dog class created with dog_type==&quot;bulldog&quot; and dog_age==3?
Thanks!
","It looks like you don't inject Dog into FlowManager or its methods.  Within foo you call a modules global Dog so you probably have to intercept that:
when(module_under_test).Dog(type=&quot;bulldog&quot;, age=3).thenReturn(mock())

Since the when configuration is really specific you maybe don't need to verify anything.  (foo has the type None -&gt; None; it's just a side-effect out of the blue :grin:)
","To verify the properties of the Dog object created in the `foo` method, you can make use of the `mockito.verify` method with an argument matcher. Here's how you can modify your unit test to assert the properties of the Dog object:

```python
from mockito import verify, when, mock, arg_that, any_

class TestFlowManager(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_foo_happy_flow(self):
        # Arrange
        dog_mock = mock(Dog)
        when(Dog).bark(...).thenReturn(None)

        # Act
        num_of_barks = 5
        dog_type = ""bulldog""
        dog_age = 3
        FlowManager(num_of_barks, dog_type, dog_age).foo()

        # Assert
        verify(Dog).bark(num_of_barks)
        verify(dog_mock).type = arg_that(lambda x: x == dog_type)
        verify(dog_mock).age = arg_that(lambda x: x == dog_age)

```

In the above code, we create a mock object `dog_mock` of the `Dog` class. Then, we use the `verify` method to assert the `bark` method call. Additionally, we use the `verify` method with the `dog_mock` to assert the values of the `type` and `age` properties. `arg_that` is used as an argument matcher to compare the values.

Note that we also use `any_` as the argument matcher for the `bark` method, as the exact number of barks is not important for this specific test case.",0.7535263895988464,"python, unit-testing, mockito",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Ah, I see! You're trying to replace Inf values in a dataframe with 0 using the `dplyr` package. There are a few ways to do this, but the most elegant solution is to use the `mutate()` function with the `across()` function. Here's how you can do it:
```
df &lt;- data.frame(vals &lt;- c(1, Inf, NA, NaN))

# Replace Inf values with 0 using mutate()
df &lt;- df %>% mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.finite(.), ., 0)))

# Replace NA values with 0 using mutate()
df &lt;- df %>% mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), ., 0)))

# Replace NaN values with 0 using mutate()
df &lt;- df %>% mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.nan(.), ., 0)))

# Replace Inf values with 0 using a custom function

df &lt;- df %>% mutate(across(everything(), ~ if Inf(.) then 0 else .))

All these methods will replace Inf values in the dataframe with 0. The first method uses `across()` to specify the columns, and then applies the `ifelse()` function to replace Inf values with 0. The second and third methods use `mutate()` to specify the columns and apply the `ifelse()` function directly. The fourth method uses a custom function to replace Inf values with 0.
Note that in the last method, you can replace `if Inf(.) then 0 else .` with any logical expression that evaluates to true for Inf values and false for non-Inf values.
Also, you can use `is.inf()` instead of `is.finite()` to check for Inf values, as Inf values are not necessarily finite.

Explanation:

* The code is using `for` loop instead of `while` loop to iterate over the numbers. We will change it to `while` loop to make it more readable.
* Inside the loop, we are using `$i` variable to keep track of the iteration. We will keep incrementing it until it reaches 10.
* We are using `mt_rand` function to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
* We are checking if the number is even or odd using `modulus` operator `%` and then assigning the result to `$result` variable.
* Finally, we are outputting the number and the result using `echo` statement.
* We are using `br` tag to add new line break after each output.

Here's the corrected code with a while loop:

```php
$i = 0;
while ($i < 10) {
    $number = mt_rand(1, 100);
    if ($number % 2 == 0) {

The appropriate `$result` value is assigned accordingly. Finally, the number and its corresponding result are echoed, and the `$i` variable is incremented to control the loop iteration.

","  Sure, I can help you fix the issue with the `requests` library. It looks like you're trying to use the `google-trans-new` library to translate a file, but the `requests` library is returning the file instead of the translated content.
To fix this issue, you can use the `stream` parameter in the `requests` function to specify that you want to receive the response as a stream, rather than the entire content at once. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:
```
```
import requests
from google.cloud import translation

def translate_file(file_path):
    # Set up the Google Translate API client
    client = translation.Client()
    # Set the source and target languages
    source_language = ""en""
    target_language = ""vi""

    # Make the request to translate the file
    response = client.translate(file_path, source_language, target_language)

    # Check the status of the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Download the translated content as a stream
        with open(""translated_file.txt"", ""wb"") as f:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(1024):
                f.write(chunk)

    else:
        print(""Error:"", response.status_code)

# Test the function
file_path = ""path/to/your/file.txt""
translate_file(file_path)
```

In this modified code, I added a parameter `stream` to the `requests` function, set to `True`. This tells `requests` to stream the response as it comes in, rather than saving it to a file.
I also added a new `for` loop to download the translated content as a stream, and write it to a file.
You can test this modified code by replacing the `file_path` variable with the path to your file, and running the code. The translated content should be saved to a new file, rather than the original file being returned.

To resolve this issue, there are a few possible solutions:

1. Check the URL and parameters: Ensure that the URL you are using for the translation request is correct and that you are passing the necessary parameters. Double-check the documentation of the Google Translate API to make sure you are using the correct endpoint and parameters.

2. Verify the request headers: Make sure that you are setting the appropriate headers in your request. Some APIs require specific headers for authentication or to specify the content type. Check the Google Translate API documentation to see if any specific headers are required.

3. Authenticate properly: If the Google Translate API requires authentication, ensure that you are providing the necessary credentials or API key in your request. Without proper authentication, the API may not process the translation request correctly.

4. Check the file format and encoding: Verify that the file you are sending for translation is in the correct format and encoding. Some APIs may have specific requirements for file formats or encodings. Ensure that your file matches those requirements.

5. Debug the response: Inspect the response object returned by the `requests.post()` method to see if it contains any error messages or useful information. You can print the response status code (`response.status_code`) and response content (`response.content`) to check if there are any error messages or unexpected results.

73634127,How to find the number of bytes that Garbage Collector has freed up till now?,"Can anyone tell me How to find out the amount of memory that GC has freed up in an application until now?
","The GarbageCollectorMXBean exposes garbage collector information, but only the number of collection runs and total time, and no information of the number of objects collected or memory freed.
So from the standard API, there's no way to get this information.
I assume that this would actually be quite an overhead for any garbage collector implementation to compute the actually freed size, so I doubt that this information can be obtained even from the actual GC implementations.
","  Certainly! The Java Garbage Collector (GC) is responsible for automatically managing the memory used by an application. One of the metrics that the GC provides is the amount of memory that it has freed up since the application started. Here are the steps to find out the amount of memory that the GC has freed up in an application until now:
1. Identify the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is running your application. You can do this by running the `jconsole` command in the terminal or by using a tool like `jconsole` or `jVisualVM`.
2. Once you have opened the JVM, you can find the name of the JVM in the ""VM Information"" section.
3. Next, navigate to the ""Memory"" tab in the JVM. Here, you will see a graph that shows the total amount of memory used by the application, as well as the amount of memory that the GC has freed up over time.
4. To find out the amount of memory that the GC has freed up specifically, you can look at the "" heap dump"" section of the JVM. This section shows the amount of memory that is currently allocated to the application, as well as the amount of memory that is available for allocation.
5. To get the total amount of memory that the GC has freed up, you can subtract the amount of memory that is currently allocated from the total amount of memory available. This will give you the amount of memory that the GC has freed up.
For example, let's say that the total amount of memory available is 1000 MB, and the application is currently using 500 MB. If the GC has freed up 200 MB of memory, then the amount of memory that the GC has freed up would be 200 MB.
Note that the amount of memory that the GC can free up may vary depending on the amount of memory available, the amount of memory used by the application, and the frequency of garbage collection runs. Additionally, the amount of memory that the GC can free up may be limited by the operating system's memory constraints.",0.6196943521499634,java,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;

import java.lang.management.MemoryUsage;
```

2. Get an instance of the MemoryMXBean:
```java
MemoryMXBean memoryMXBean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();

```java
MemoryUsage beforeGC = memoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage();
System.gc(); // Explicitly trigger garbage collection
MemoryUsage afterGC = memoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage();
```

4. Calculate the amount of memory freed up by the GC:
```java
long freedBytes = beforeGC.getUsed() - afterGC.getUsed();
```

The `freedBytes` variable will now hold the number of bytes that the Garbage Collector has freed up until now.

Note that the accuracy of this calculation may vary depending on the JVM implementation and the garbage collection algorithm in use. Additionally, keep in mind that explicitly triggering garbage collection with `System.gc()` is generally not recommended in normal application code, as the JVM is designed to manage memory automatically.",0.7450054883956909,java,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Ah, I see what you're trying to achieve! You want to create a coupon-like button with a half circle shape on top of a bordered container, with the circle clipped to the border.
To achieve this, you can use a combination of `Matrix4` transforms and `BoxDecoration` to create the illusion of a clipped circle. Here's an updated version of your code that should give you the desired result:
```dart
Container(
      height: 168,
      width: double.infinity,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(
          color: ColorService.purple,
        ),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
      ),
      child: Row(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            flex: 5,
            child: Container(
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.only(
                  topLeft: Radius.circular(8),
                  bottomLeft: Radius.circular(8),
                ),
                color: Colors.amberAccent,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Add a transformation matrix to clip the circle
          Container(
            transform: Matrix4.translationValues(0, -10, 0),
            width: 20,
            height: 20,
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.white,
              border: Border.all(
                color: ColorService.purple,
              ),
              shape: BoxShape.circle,
            ),
          ),
          // Add another transformation matrix to move the circle to the top
          Container(
            transform: Matrix4.translationValues(0, 10, 0),
            width: 20,
            height: 20,
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.white,
              border: Border.all(
                color: ColorService.purple,
              ),
              shape: BoxShape.circle,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );

```
In this updated version, I've added two `Container` widgets inside the `Row` widget. The first ` Container` widget has a `transform` property set to a `Matrix4` transform that moves the circle 10 pixels down and to the left. The second `Container` widget has a `transform` property set to another `Matrix4` transform that moves the circle to the top of the container.
By combining these two transformations, we create the illusion of a clipped circle that is attached to the border of the container.
Note that you may need to adjust the values of the `Matrix4` transforms to achieve the desired positioning and clipping of the circle.",0.5231239795684814,"android, ios, flutter, mobile",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To achieve the desired clipped effect on your circle, you can use the `ClipPath` widget in Flutter. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:

1. Import the required packages:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';
```

2. Wrap your `Container` with a `ClipPath` widget and set the `clipper` property to a custom `CouponClipper` class that extends `CustomClipper<Path>`. This will define the clipping path for the half circle shape.
```dart
Container(
  height: 168,
  width: double.infinity,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    border: Border.all(
      color: Colors.purple,
    ),
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
  ),
  child: ClipPath(
    clipper: CouponClipper(), // Custom clipper class
    child: Row(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          flex: 5,
          child: Container(
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.only(
                topLeft: Radius.circular(8),
                bottomLeft: Radius.circular(8),
              ),
              color: Colors.amberAccent,
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Rest of your code...
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```

3. Define the `CouponClipper` class to create the clipping path for the half circle shape:
```dart
class CouponClipper extends CustomClipper<Path> {
  @override
  Path getClip(Size size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.lineTo(0, size.height);
    path.arcToPoint(
      Offset(size.width, size.height),
      radius: Radius.circular(size.width / 2),
      clockwise: false,
    );
    path.lineTo(size.width, 0);
    return path;
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReclip(CustomClipper<Path> oldClipper) => false;
}
```

With these modifications, the circle shape will be clipped at the border, giving it the appearance of a coupon.",0.5633628368377686,"android, ios, flutter, mobile",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","In C++, () is a function call operator and is used to call the function. For example, when you write main(), you are calling the function main which in turn causes the main function to start executing.
To access an element of a vector, you should use subscript operator [] not function call operator ().
I've highlighted the mistakes in your duplicateSort sort function below:
//           function argument should just list the name without `()` operator          
//                             vvvvvvv
void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list(), int length, int&amp; fpy) {     
      //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
//               vvvvvvv    vvvvvvv   to access element of a vector use [] operator
              if(list(i) == list(j))
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }
          }
      }
  }

To make your program work, change the function as follows:
 void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list, int length, int&amp; fpy) {     //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
              if(list[i] == list[j])
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }
          }
      }
  }

"," The error message you're seeing is because you have too many arguments passed to the `duplicateSort` function. The function signature is defined as `void duplicateSort(vector<int>& list, int length, int& fpy)`, but you're calling it with three arguments `duplicateSort(list, length, fpy)`.
The solution is to remove the unnecessary arguments in the call. You can simplify the call to `duplicateSort` to `duplicateSort(list, length)`.
Here's a corrected version of your code with the fix applied:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void duplicateSort(vector<int>& list, int length);


int main() {
    // ...

    duplicateSort(list, length);


    return 0;
```
In this version, the `duplicateSort` function takes only one argument, the `list` vector, and the `length` variable is passed as a parameter in the `main` function.
Additionally, it's a good practice to use a const reference for the `list` vector in the function signature, like this: `void duplicateSort(const vector<int>& list, int length)`. This makes the function more readable and makes it clear that the `list` vector is not modified inside the function.",0.7951775789260864,"c++, c++14",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","In C++, () is a function call operator and is used to call the function. For example, when you write main(), you are calling the function main which in turn causes the main function to start executing.
To access an element of a vector, you should use subscript operator [] not function call operator ().
I've highlighted the mistakes in your duplicateSort sort function below:
//           function argument should just list the name without `()` operator          
//                             vvvvvvv
void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list(), int length, int&amp; fpy) {     
      //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
//               vvvvvvv    vvvvvvv   to access element of a vector use [] operator
              if(list(i) == list(j))
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }
          }
      }
  }

To make your program work, change the function as follows:
 void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list, int length, int&amp; fpy) {     //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
              if(list[i] == list[j])
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }
          }
      }
  }

","The error you are encountering is due to incorrect usage of the vector elements in the function `duplicateSort`. 

In C++, vector elements are accessed using square brackets `[]`, not parentheses `()`. So, instead of `list(i)` and `list(j)`, you should use `list[i]` and `list[j]` respectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `duplicateSort` function:

```cpp
void duplicateSort(vector<int>& list, int length, int& fpy) {
    int match = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
            if (list[i] == list[j])
                match++;
            if (match == 1) {
                fpy++;
                match = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By making this change, you should be able to fix the ""error: too many arguments to function"" issue.",0.8607567548751831,"c++, c++14",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","A null property in the object that was being posted caused the post to fail. Make sure all properties that are not nullable have a value.
","  The problem you're facing is likely related to the way you're handling the `OnSubmitCallback` event in your `Blazor` application. When you call `OnSubmitCallback.InvokeAsync();`, it's expecting a `IEnumerable` of `DateGenerator.Shared.Date` objects, but you're not providing one.
To fix this issue, you can modify your `HandleValidSubmit` method to return the list of `DateGenerator.Shared.Date` objects instead of calling `OnSubmitCallback.InvokeAsync();`. Here's an updated version of your method:
```csharp
public async Task HandleValidSubmit()
{
        var connectedUser = DateGenerator.Shared.ConnectedUser.Get();
        if (connectedUser == null || connectedUser.UserId == 0)
        {
            string? email = AuthProvider?.GetAuthenticationStateAsync()?.Result?.User?.Identity?.Name;
            if (email == null)
                StateHasChanged();

            var users = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<List<DateGenerator.Shared.User>>(""api/Users"");
            if (users != null && users.Any(u => u.Email == email))
                DateGenerator.Shared.ConnectedUser.Set(users.First(u => u.Email == email));

        }

        if (connectedUser == null)
            return;

        var newDate = new Date(date, connectedUser);

        await Http.PostAsJsonAsync<DateGenerator.Shared.Date>(""api/Dates"", newDate);
        return await HandleValidSubmitAsync(); // Return the list of dates

    }
```
In this updated implementation, I've added a `return` statement after calling `await handlesValidSubmitAsync()` to return the list of `DateGenerator.Shared.Date` objects. This will tell Blazor to execute the code inside the `HandleValidSubmitAsync` method, which will contain the logic to call the `Post` action in the `DatesController`.
Also, I've removed the `OnSubmitCallback.InvokeAsync()` call, as you're not providing a `IEnumerable` of `DateGenerator.Shared.Date` objects.
With these changes, your `Blazor` application should now be able to call the `Post` action in the `DatesController` when the form is validated.",0.3780840039253235,"blazor, blazor-server-side, blazor-webassembly",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","A null property in the object that was being posted caused the post to fail. Make sure all properties that are not nullable have a value.
","Based on the code you have provided, there are a few potential reasons why the Post action in your DatesController is not getting called:

1. Verify that the API endpoint is correctly configured in the Startup.cs file of your Blazor application. Make sure you have added the necessary routing for the ""api"" prefix:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();
    endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
    endpoints.MapFallbackToPage(""/_Host"");
});
```

2. Check if there are any validation errors preventing the form submission. Ensure that all required form fields are populated correctly. You can add validation messages to the form fields to help identify any issues.

3. Make sure that the form's OnValidSubmit event is being triggered. You can add a debug breakpoint inside the HandleValidSubmit method to verify if it is being called.

4. Check if the OnSubmitCallback event is properly set and initialized in the parent component. Ensure that the event is correctly wired up to handle the callback when the form is submitted.

5. Verify if the Http client (Http) is properly injected into your component. Ensure that the HttpClient is registered in the DI container in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup.cs file:

```csharp
services.AddHttpClient();
```

6. Ensure that the API endpoint URL is correct. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if any errors or unexpected responses occur when the Post request is made.

In this updated code, I've removed the function from the `classList.add()` method and replaced it with an anonymous function that adds the `openPopOut` function to the `classList` when the button is clicked.
Additionally, I've added an `if` statement in the `html.addEventListener()` method to check whether the click event occurred on the pop-out element itself, and if so, remove the `pop-out` class from the HTML element.

","The error you are encountering is due to the incorrect usage of the `classList.add()` method. The method expects a string parameter representing the class name you want to add, but you are passing a function instead.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the following line of code:

```javascript
activateBtn.classList.add(openPopOut);
```

Change it to:

```javascript
activateBtn.addEventListener(""click"", openPopOut);
```

This will correctly add the `openPopOut` function as the event listener for the click event on the `activateBtn` element.

Additionally, to remove the popout when clicked outside the area, you should update the event listener on the HTML element. Instead of checking if `e.target !== popOut`, you should check if `e.target !== popOut && !popOut.contains(e.target)`. This will ensure that the popout is only closed if the click event target is not the popout element or any of its descendants.

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
html.addEventListener(""click"", function (e) {
  if (e.target !== popOut && !popOut.contains(e.target)) {
    popOut.classList.remove(""open"");
  }
});
```

With these changes, the popout should be closed when clicked outside its area.",0.7854311466217041,"javascript, html, css",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The issue you're encountering is that the `stdout` field in your JSON output is an array of objects, not a single object. Therefore, you cannot access the `value` field directly using `.stdout[].value`.
To retrieve the value of the `value` field for each object in the `stdout` array, you can use the `json_query` module's `$object` syntax. This allows you to select specific fields from an object within an array:
Here's an example of how you can modify your `debug` task to retrieve the `value` field for each object in the `stdout` array:
```yaml
    - debug:
        msg: '{{ token | community.general.json_query(""$.stdout[*].value"") }}'
      vars:
        token: ""{{ item }}""
```
In this example, the `json_query` module is used to retrieve the `value` field for each object in the `stdout` array. The `$.stdout[*].value` expression selects the `value` field for each object in the `stdout` array, and the `*` wildcard is used toiterate over each object.
Note that the `community.general` module is used to enable the `json_query` module. If you don't have this module loaded, you can replace it with the `json_query` module directly.

To further extract the value field from each dictionary, you can modify the query as follows:

```yaml
- debug:
    msg: ""{{ token | json_query(query) }}""
  vars:
    query: ""[].stdout | from_json | value""
```

This query will extract the `value` field from each dictionary in the list. The output will be a list of values.

If you want to extract a single value, you can modify the query to access a specific index:

```yaml
- debug:
    msg: ""{{ token | json_query(query) }}""
  vars:
    query: ""[].stdout | from_json | value[0]""
```

This query will extract the first value from the list.

After that, add a &quot;Copy File&quot; build phase that embeds the framework file.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! It's common for developers to face challenges when distributing a framework to external users, especially when there are frequent changes to the framework code. Here are some possible solutions to help you handle this scenario:
1. Use branches:
	* In Git, you can create a separate branch for your framework project and branch the Demo app from that branch.
	* When you make changes to the framework code, you can commit and push those changes to the branch.
	* Once the changes are ready, you can merge the branch into the main branch of the Demo app. This will create a new XCFramework that includes the updated framework code.
2. Use a continuous integration pipeline:
	* Set up a continuous integration pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI) that automatically builds and recompiles the XCFramework whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
	* This ensures that the XCFramework is always up-to-date and accurate, even if you make changes to the framework code frequently.
3. Manually regenerate the XCFramework:
	* When you make changes to the framework code, you can manually regenerate the XCFramework by building the framework project and then exporting the resulting framework as an XCFramework.
	* You can automate this process by using a script that runs after changes are pushed to the repository.
4. Use a package manager:
	* Instead of using a manual process to regenerate the XCFramework, you can use a package manager (e.g., Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods) to manage the distribution of your framework.
	* When you make changes to the framework code, you can simply run a command to update the package, and the package manager will take care of recompiling and reexporting the updated framework.
5. Use a separate framework project:
	* Consider creating a separate project for your framework, and then integrating that project into the Demo app.
	* This can help keep the framework code isolated from the Demo app code, making it easier to manage and distribute the framework.
In terms of drag and dropping the framework project into the Demo app, you can follow these steps:
	* Open the framework project in Xcode.
	* Select the framework target in the project navigator.
	* Click on the ""Targets"" tab in the project settings.
	* Under the ""General"" section, select ""Advanced"" and then ""Drag and drop"".
	* In the ""Drag and drop"" section, select the ""Framework"" option and then click ""Add"".
	* Repeat the above steps for any additional frameworks you want to add to the Demo app.
Once you've added the framework project, you can build and run the Demo app as usual. When you make changes to the framework code, you can simply regenerate the XCFramework by building the framework project and then exporting the resulting framework as an XCFramework.",0.7112002372741699,"xcode, swift-package-manager, xcframework",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

2. Make the necessary changes to the Framework's project.
   - Modify the code, add new features, or fix any bugs.

3. Build the Framework's project.
   - Go to the Product menu in Xcode and select Build.
   - This will compile the Framework and generate the updated XCFramework.

4. Replace the existing XCFramework in your Demo app.
   - Locate the XCFramework file in your Demo app's project directory.
   - Replace the old XCFramework file with the newly generated one.

5. Test the changes in your Demo app.
   - Build and run your Demo app to ensure that the changes in the Framework are working as expected.

Note: Whenever you make changes to the Framework's project, you need to rebuild the Framework and replace the XCFramework in your Demo app. This ensures that the latest changes are reflected in your Demo app.

asd = ['926', '927', '928', '929', '930', '931']
# Filter the list to get only the numbers
numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x.isdigit(), asd))
print(numbers)  # Output: [926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931]
```
In this example, we use the `filter()` method to apply a function to each element in the `asd` list. The function `lambda x: x.isdigit()` checks whether each element is a digit or not. Since `926`, `927`, `928`, `929`, `930`, and `931` are all digits, they are included in the filtered list `numbers`.
Alternatively, you can use the `map()` method to apply a function to each element in the list, and then use the `filter()` method to filter the resulting list:
```python
asd = ['926', '927', '928', '929', '930', '931']
# Filter the list to get only the numbers
numbers = list(map(int, asd))
print(numbers)  # Output: [926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931]
```
In this example, we use the `map()` method to apply the `int()` function to each element in the `asd` list, converting them to integers. Then, we use the `filter()` method to filter the resulting list to get only the integers.
Both of these approaches will give you the same output, which is a list of numbers in the list `asd`.",0.5990105867385864,python,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Yes, there is a way to get a list of numbers in Python without using numpy. One approach is to use a list comprehension to generate the desired range of numbers.

```

Output:
['926', '927', '928', '929', '930', '931']

In this example, the `range(926, 932)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 926 to 931 (inclusive). The list comprehension `[str(num) for num in range(926, 932)]` iterates over each number in the range and converts it to a string using the `str()` function. Finally, the resulting list of strings is stored in the `numbers` variable and printed.",0.706562340259552,python,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

How can I make Clickhouse generate new metadata on this new Zookeeper cluster?
","system restore replica 'your_table';

https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/system/#restore-replica
","  Ah, I see! Losing a Zookeeper cluster can cause significant issues with Clickhouse, as it relies on Zookeeper for storing its metadata. Fortunately, Clickhouse has a built-in feature to handle this scenario: the `--force-new-metadata` flag.
To generate new metadata on the new Zookeeper cluster, you can use the following command:
```
$ bin/clickhouse-server --force-new-metadata
```
When you run this command, Clickhouse will stop any existing instances and start a new one with the new metadata. Note that this will also drop any existing data in Clickhouse, so you may want to make sure you have backups of your data before running this command.
As for why Clickhouse is putting tables in READ_ONLY mode after losing the Zookeeper cluster, it's likely because it can't find the new metadata. When Clickhouse can't find the metadata, it assumes that the metadata is still the same as when it last worked, so it sets the tables to READ_ONLY mode to prevent any inconsistencies.
By using the `--force-new-metadata` flag, you can tell Clickhouse to ignore the old metadata and generate a new set of metadata based on the new Zookeeper cluster. This should allow Clickhouse to start using the new metadata and save new PostHog events.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",0.3361232876777649,"apache-zookeeper, clickhouse, posthog",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/system/#restore-replica
","To fix the issue of Clickhouse not working after losing the Zookeeper cluster, you can follow these steps to force Clickhouse to generate new metadata:

1. Stop Clickhouse: First, stop the Clickhouse service to make sure no changes are being made while fixing the issue.

2. Clear the Zookeeper data: Delete the Zookeeper data directory on all nodes of the Clickhouse cluster. The default location is usually `/var/lib/zookeeper`.

3. Update Clickhouse configuration: Open the Clickhouse configuration file (`clickhouse-server.conf`) and locate the `zookeeper_servers` parameter. Update it with the new Zookeeper cluster's IP addresses or hostnames.

4. Remove metadata from Clickhouse: Identify the metadata directory in Clickhouse. By default, it is located at `/var/lib/clickhouse/metadata`. Delete all the files and directories inside the metadata directory.

5. Start Clickhouse: Start the Clickhouse service again. It will now connect to the new Zookeeper cluster and generate new metadata based on the current state.

6. Verify Clickhouse status: Check the Clickhouse logs to ensure that it successfully connects to the new Zookeeper cluster and that the tables are no longer in READ_ONLY mode.

7. Test Posthog events: Once Clickhouse is up and running with the new metadata, test Posthog events to ensure they are now being saved correctly.

","  The issue you're experiencing is caused by the `Wscript.Shell` object in your PowerShell script. When you use `New-Object -ComObject ""Wscript.Shell""` to create a new instance of the `Wscript.Shell` object, PowerShell creates a new instance of the `WScriptShell` COM component, which is the component responsible for displaying message boxes in Windows.
Each time you use `Wscript.Shell` to display a message box, a new instance of the `WScriptShell` COM component is created, which leads to multiple instances of the message box being displayed. This is what's causing the 10+ popup boxes or an endless loop of them that you're experiencing.
To fix this issue, you can use the `SendMessage` method of the `Wscript.Shell` object to send a message to the main `WScriptShell` window, rather than creating a new instance of the `WScriptShell` component. Here's an example of how you can modify your script to use `SendMessage`:
Change the line ` `$ws = New-Object -ComObject ""Wscript.Shell""` to `$ws = [WScriptShell]::CreateObject(""Wscript.Shell"")`
change the line `$ws.Popup(""A new update message here..."", $timeout, $org, 0)` to `$ws.SendMessage 0x109, ""A new update message here..."", $timeout, $org, 0)`
The `SendMessage` method takes four parameters: the first is the message type (in this case, `0x109` is the message type for a custom message box), the second is the message itself, the third is the timeout value (in seconds), the fourth is the title of the message box, and the fifth is the window handle (in this case, `$ws` is the `Wscript.Shell` object, so we don't need to provide a window handle).
By using `SendMessage` instead of `New-Object -ComObject`, you can avoid creating multiple instances of the `WScriptShell` component and display the message box in a single instance, which should fix the issue of multiple message boxes being displayed.",0.18508660793304443,"windows, powershell, batch-file, command, powershell-4.0",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The issue you are facing with the PowerShell script is that the message box is being displayed in a loop, causing multiple popups to appear continuously. This is because the foreach loop that iterates through the zip files is also inside the loop that displays the message box.

To fix this problem, you need to move the foreach loop outside of the loop that displays the message box. Here's the updated script:

```
$dst = ""C:\Testing\DB""
Copy-item -Path ""C:\Users\user\dropfilehere\*.zip"" -destination ""C:\Testing\Other\In"" -Force

# Extract and process each zip file
Foreach ($zipfile in (Get-ChildItem ""C:\Testing\Other\In\*.zip"" -Recurse)) {
    Add-Type -Assembly System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
    $zipFile = [IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead($zipfile)
    $csvFiles = $zipFile.Entries | where {$_.Name -like '*.csv'}

    # Extract each CSV file and overwrite old file
    foreach ($csvFile in $csvFiles) {
        $csvFileName = $csvFile.Name
        [System.IO.Compression.ZipFileExtensions]::ExtractToFile($csvFile, ""$dst\DB.csv"", $true)
    }

    $zipFile.Dispose()
    Remove-Item ""C:\Testing\Other\In\*"" -Recurse -Force
    Remove-Item ""C:\Users\user\dropfilehere\*"" -Recurse -Force
}

# Display a single message box after processing all zip files
$org = ""Name of Org""
$timeout = 60 # in seconds
$ws = New-Object -ComObject ""Wscript.Shell""
$intButton = $ws.Popup(""A new update message here`nAnother message here."", $timeout, $org, 0)

exit
```

With this modification, the message box will be displayed only once after processing all the zip files. The foreach loop is now responsible for extracting the CSV files from each zip file, while the outer loop takes care of copying the zip files, deleting their contents, and finally displaying the message box.

","It's a myth, but alas a persistent one, that loops are slow in MATLAB.  As you've written your for loop, it goes sequentially through the last dimension of your variables. That pretty much translates to a FORTRAN loop directly, leaving little room for improvement using vectorisation. The below does vectorise your output as much as possible, but doesn't improve performance much, even though reshape() is almost free, and severely degrades readability.
In each iteration, all you're doing is calculating y(c,1).*((z(:,:,c)-e(c)).^2), which is added to the total. If we are able to vectorise that expression, we can sum over the dimension of c to get rid of the loop.
z(:,:,c)-e(c) can be vectorised by adding two singleton dimensions to e: reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)]), then subtract and power by 2 as usual.
Multiplication by  y(c,1) also works, if we add two singleton dimensions to y(:,1):, reshape(y(:,1), [1 1 numel(e)]), then multiply again as usual.
Finally, we just need to sum over our 3rd dimension and we end up with our t -by- t result: sum(tmp2, 3).
All that's left are the hardcoded three dimensions in x, which I've left be in a loop.
The working code on R2007b:
variables=10;
t=2;
x=zeros(t,t,3);
y=rand(variables,3);
z=rand(t,t,variables);
e=rand(variables,1);

    x(:, :, ii) = sum(bsxfun(@times, reshape(y(:,1), [1 1 numel(e)]), bsxfun(@minus, z, reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)])).^2), 3);
end

I wasn't sure what to do with the hardcoded dimension of 3, so I just left a loop over that. The rest is vectorised away, thanks to a few reshape() calls to arrange the dimensions for the bsxfun() expansion.
Code for &gt;R2016b with implicit expansion:
for ii = 1:size(x, 3)
    x(:, :, ii) = sum(reshape(y(:,ii), [1 1 numel(e)]) .* (z -  reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)])).^2, 3)

A quick timing comparison shows that this is roughly 2x faster than your original loop:
Elapsed time is 0.780516 seconds. Original code
Elapsed time is 0.397369 seconds. My bsxfun() solution
Elapsed time is 0.305160 seconds. My implicit expansion

Note that in the above a 100 loops were ran for each code version, i.e. timings are 8ms, 4ms and 3ms per version.

For an introduction to reshape() you can refer to this answer of mine.
The documentation article on implicit broadcasting is rather good, as is this blog.
","  Yes, you are correct. The for loop with a large variable `variables` can lead to a slow calculation. Here are a few ways to optimize the code to improve calculation speed:
1. Use a vectorized approach: Instead of iterate over `c` in the for loop, you can use vectorized operations on the matrix `z` to compute the term `z(c,:) - e(c)`. This can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
Here's an example:
```matlab
% Replace the for loop with a vectorized approach
x = zeros(t, t, 3);
y = rand(variables, 3);
z = rand(t, t, variables);
e = rand(variables, 1);
for c = 1:variables
    x(:,:,1) = x(:,:,1) + y(c).*sum(z .* (z(:,:) - e).^2, 2);
    x(:,:,2) = x(:,:,2) + y(c).*sum(z .* (z(:,:) - e).^2, 3);
    x(:,:,3) = x(:,:,3) + y(c).*sum(z .* (z(:,:) - e).^2, 4);
end
```
In this example, we use the `sum` function to compute the vectorized dot product of `z` and `(z - e).^2`, and then multiply the result by `y(c)`. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.
2. Use the `blkdiag` function: The `blkdiag` function in MATLAB can be used to solve a block diagonal system of equations, which can be used to speed up the calculation in the for loop.
Here's an example:
```matlab
% Replace the for loop with blkdiag

x = zeros(t, t, 3);
y = rand(variables, 3);
z = rand(t, t, variables);
e = rand(variables, 1);
blkdiag(x, y, z, e);
```
In this example, we use the `blkdiag` function to solve the block diagonal system of equations `x = y.*sum(z.*(z - e).^2, 2)`, which is computed in parallel. This can significantly improve performance for large problem sizes.
3. Use the `bsxfun` function: The `bsxfun` function in MATLAB can be used to perform element-wise multiplication and addition operations on large arrays.
Here's an example:
```matlab
% Replace the for loop with bsxfun

x = zeros(t, t, 3);
y = rand(variables, 3);
z = rand(t, t, variables);
e = rand(variables, 1);
bsxfun(@plus, x, y, z, e);
```
In this example, we use the `bsxfun` function to perform element-wise multiplication and addition operations on `x`, `y`, `z`, and `e`. This can significantly improve performance for large problem sizes.
4. Use a GPU-accelerated library: If you have access to a GPU-enabled system, you can use a GPU-accelerated library such as cuBLAS or cuSolver to accelerate the computation.
Here's an example:
```matlab
% Replace the for loop with a GPU-accelerated version


x = zeros(t, t, 3);
y = rand(variables, 3);
z = rand(t, t, variables);
e = rand(variables, 1);
custransfer();
% Compute the dot product using cuBLAS
x = x + y.*sum(z.*(z - e).^2, 2);
```
In this example, we use the `custransfer` function to transfer the data to the GPU, and then use the `sum` function with the `cuBLAS` function to perform the dot product operation. This can significantly improve performance for large problem sizes.

","To optimize the for loop in MATLAB, you can use vectorization instead of looping over each variable. Here's an optimized version of your code:

```matlab
variables = 1000;
t = 20;
x = zeros(t, t, 3);
y = rand(variables, 3);
z = rand(t, t, variables);
e = rand(variables, 1);

% Preallocate intermediate matrix
temp = zeros(t, t, variables);

for c = 1:variables
    temp(:, :, c) = (z(:, :, c) - e(c)).^2;
end

% Compute x using element-wise multiplication and sum
x(:, :, 1) = sum(bsxfun(@times, temp, y(:, 1)), 3);
x(:, :, 2) = sum(bsxfun(@times, temp, y(:, 2)), 3);
x(:, :, 3) = sum(bsxfun(@times, temp, y(:, 3)), 3);
```

In this optimized version, we preallocate the `temp` matrix outside the loop and compute the intermediate results in it. Then, we use element-wise multiplication (`bsxfun`) to multiply the `temp` matrix with the corresponding `y` values for each channel, and sum along the third dimension to obtain the final `x` matrix.

By avoiding the for-loop and using vectorized operations, this code should significantly improve the calculation speed.",0.7321139574050903,"matlab, for-loop, optimization",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

It's worth noting that you don't have to make your own wheels, the standard already provides something like Iteratable and subtypes, namely ranges::range and ranges::range_value_t.
","  I can understand your concern about finding a clean solution for declval when dealing with types that don't have a default constructor. The utilities provided in C++20, such as `std::declval`, are designed to work with types that have a default constructor, and they can give you unexpected results when dealing with types that don't have one.
There are a few workarounds you could consider:
1. Use `std::move` to move an object: If you have an object of a type that doesn't have a default constructor, you can use `std::move` to move it to a temporary object that has a default constructor. This can be useful when you want to pass an object to a function that requires a default-constructible type. For example:
```
template<typename T>
constexpr auto declval() {
    return std::move(std::declval<T>());
}
```
This will create a temporary object of type `T` that is default-constructible, and then move it to the `declval`return value.
1. Use `std::get<0>` to extract the inner type: If you have a sequence of types that are all default-constructible, you can use `std::get<0>` to extract the inner type from the sequence. For example:
```
template<typename T>
constexpr auto declval() {
    return *std::get<0>(std::declval<T>());
}
```
This will create a default-constructible object of type `T`, and then return it as the `declval` return value.
1. Use `std::decay_t` to simplify the type: If you have a type that doesn't have a default constructor, but you know that it has a `std::decay_t` constructor, you can use `std::decay_t` to simplify the type and avoid the need for `std::declval`. For example:
```
template<typename T>
constexpr auto declval() {
    return std::decay_t<T>();
}
```
This will create a default-constructible object of type `T`, and then return it as the `declval` return value.
As for whether there is a clean way to declval, the standard library doesn't provide a utility that fully constructs a passed object, so you may need to use a workaround like the ones I mentioned. However, using statements can be a viable alternative, as it allows you to write more expressive and flexible code:
```
template<typename T>
void foo(T &&arg) {
    // do something with arg
}

int main() {

    foo(std::declval<int>());

}

This will call the `foo` function with the default-constructible `int` value, and then pass the result as the `arg` parameter to the `foo` function.

It's worth noting that you don't have to make your own wheels, the standard already provides something like Iteratable and subtypes, namely ranges::range and ranges::range_value_t.
","The problem you are facing occurs because when you try to return `subtype<T>{}`, the compiler requires a default constructor for `subtype<T>`. Since `subtype<T>` is deduced from `decltype(*(std::declval<T>().begin()))`, if `*(std::declval<T>().begin())` returns a type that does not have a default constructor, the code fails to compile.

To address this issue, you can use the `std::declval` function template to create an rvalue reference of the type you need, without actually constructing an object. `std::declval` is typically used in the context of type deduction, such as in `decltype` expressions, and it can also be useful in constexpr contexts.

Here's an updated version of your code that uses `std::declval` to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <deque>

template <typename T>
concept Iteratable = requires(T n) {
    n.begin();
    n.end();
};

namespace detail {
    template <Iteratable T>
    using subtype = std::decay_t<decltype(*(std::declval<T>().begin()))>;

    template <Iteratable T>
    constexpr auto deepest_subtype_recursive() {
        if constexpr (Iteratable<subtype<T>>) {
            return detail::deepest_subtype_recursive<subtype<T>>();
        }
        else {
            return std::declval<subtype<T>>(); // Using std::declval here
        }
    }
}

template <Iteratable T>
using deepest_subtype = decltype(detail::deepest_subtype_recursive<T>());

struct foo {
    foo(int) {}
};

int main() {
    using container_type = std::vector<std::list<std::deque<foo>>>;
    using deepest = deepest_subtype<container_type>;

    static_assert(std::is_same_v<deepest, foo>);
}
```

In this updated code, the `std::declval` function template is used to create an rvalue reference of `subtype<T>`. This allows you to return the type without needing to construct an object with a default constructor. Note that `std::declval` should not be used to access the value of the object; it should only be used to create an rvalue reference for type deduction purposes.

Using `std::declval` in this way provides a clean solution to the problem without requiring unnecessary default constructors.",0.6971259117126465,"c++, c++20, constexpr, typetraits",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  To match the information associated with each tag using a regex pattern in Python, you can use the following pattern:
pattern = r""(/x=(?P<name>[\w largo])/)""
Explanation of the pattern:
* r"": This is the syntax for raw strings in Python.
* ""(/x=(?P<name>[\w largo])/)"":
This pattern matches any string in the format /x=y, where y is a word consisting of letters and digits ([\w largo]). The name attribute is captured using a named group (<name>) and the rest of the match is matched as a group (y).
?P<name> means that the name attribute is a named capture group, so you can access it later using the name attribute in the findall results.
Here's an example of how you can use this pattern to match the information associated with each tag in your input string:
linein = "" /yellow=flower/blue=sky""
pattern = r""(/x=(?P<name>[\w largo])/)""
p2 = re.findall(pattern, linein)
print(p2)
yellow flower

- `=`: Matches the equals sign ""="".
- `([A-Za-z0-9]+)`: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters and captures them as a group.

The `re.findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string `linein`.

By iterating over this list, you can print the tag and the associated information separately.

 )*                # repeat as often as possible
)                  # end of capturingn group

","  To match a pattern with a single group (on level 1) in REGEX, you can use the following approach:
You can try the following pattern: `.*? Thread-(.*)`. This pattern will match the entire string if it starts with ""Thread "". The () after the first pattern will capture the value that follows the ""Thread"".
Here's how this pattern would work:
* `.*?*` matches any character (including whitespace) lazily (i.e., only once). This is to ensure the pattern can match the entire string if it starts with ""Thread"".
* `Thread-` matches the pattern ""Thread-"".
* `(.*)` captures any character (including whitespace) and stores it in a group.
* `.*` matches any character (including whitespace) until the end of the string. Since we're using lazy matching, this will only match the entire string if it ends with ""Thread"".
So, if your input string is ""https://www.mypage.com/thread-3306-page-32.html"", the pattern will match ""3306"" in the first group, and the entire string ""thread-3306-page-32.html"" in the second group.
If your input string is ""https://www.mypage.com/thread-3306.html"", the pattern will match ""3306"" in the first group, and ""thread-3306.html"" in the second group.
If your input string is ""https://www.mypage.com/String-Thread-Id"", the pattern will match ""String-Thread-Id"" in the single group.

So I want a Pattern, that gives me for line 1 and 2 the number 3306 and for the last line &quot;String-Thread-Id&quot;
My current state is .*[t|T]hread-(.*)[\-page.*|.html]. But it fails at the end after the id. How to do it well? I also solved it like .*Thread-(.*)|.*thread-(\\w+).*, but this is with two groups not applicable for my java code.
","Not knowing if this fits for all situations, but I would try this:
^.*?thread-((?:(?!-page|\.html).)*)

In Java, that could look something like
List&lt;String&gt; matchList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(&quot;^.*?thread-((?:(?!-page|\\.html).)*)&quot;, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE | Pattern.MULTILINE);
Matcher regexMatcher = regex.matcher(subjectString);
while (regexMatcher.find()) {
    matchList.add(regexMatcher.group(1));
} 

Explanation:
^                  # Match start of line
.*?                # Match any number of characters, as few as possible
thread-            # until &quot;thread-&quot; is matched.
(                  # Then start a capturing group (number 1) to match:
 (?:               # (start of non-capturing group)
  (?!-page|\.html) # assert that neither &quot;page-&quot; nor &quot;.html&quot; follow
 .                 # then match any character
 )*                # repeat as often as possible
)                  # end of capturingn group

","To fix the problem and implement the ""or"" after the group in the regex pattern, you can use the pipe symbol (`|`) to specify multiple alternatives within the pattern. Here's an updated regex pattern that should work for your requirement:

```
.*[tT]hread-(.*?)(?:-page.*|\.html)$
```

Explanation of the pattern:
- `.*` - Matches any characters before the ""thread-"" part.
- `[tT]hread-` - Matches either ""thread-"" or ""Thread-"".
- `(.*?)` - Captures the thread ID or string into group 1. The `?` makes the match non-greedy.
- `(?:-page.*|\.html)` - Specifies the alternatives after the thread ID. It matches either ""-page"" followed by any characters or "".html"" at the end of the string.
- `$` - Anchors the pattern to the end of the string.

With this pattern, you can extract the thread ID or string from the URLs using the appropriate group.

In your Java code, you can use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package to implement this pattern. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] urls = {
            ""https://www.mypage.com/thread-3306-page-32.html"",
            ""https://www.mypage.com/thread-3306.html"",
            ""https://www.mypage.com/Thread-String-Thread-Id""
        };

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("".*[tT]hread-(.*?)(?:-page.*|\\.html)$"");

        for (String url : urls) {
            Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(url);
            if (matcher.matches()) {
                String threadId = matcher.group(1);
                System.out.println(threadId);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code will output:
```
3306
3306
String-Thread-Id
```

By using the updated regex pattern and the `group(1)` method of the `Matcher` class, you can extract the desired thread ID or string from the URLs.",0.7449688911437988,"regex, nsregularexpression",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

If I wanted to insert all 250 rows into the database using PyMongo in Python, how would I ensure that every row is entered following the format that I used when I inserted it manually in the Mongo shell?
",,"  To insert all 250 rows into the database using PyMongo in Python, you can use the `collection.insert_many()` method with a list of dictionaries in the format you specified. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
import pymongo
client = pymongo.MongoClient(<YOUR_CONNECTION_URL>)

# Define the list of dictionaries to insert
data = [
    {
        ""employee_id"": 412153,
        ""first_name"": ""Carrol"",
        ""last_name"": ""Dhin"",
        ""email"": ""carrol.dhin@company.com"",
        ""managing"": [
            {
                ""manager_id"": 412153,
                ""employee_id"": 174543,
            }],

        ""department"": [

            {

                ""department_name"": ""Accounting"",

                ""department_budget"": 500000,

            }],

        ""laptop"": [

            {

                ""serial_number"": ""CSS49745"",

                ""manufacturer"": ""Lenovo"",

                ""model"": ""X1 Gen 10"",

                ""date_assigned"": datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 15),

                ""installed_software"": [""MS Office"", ""Adobe Acrobat"", ""Slack""],

            }],

    } for i in range(250)]

db_collection = client[""employees""]

# Insert the list of dictionaries

db_collection.insert_many(data)


```

In this example, the `data` list contains 250 dictionaries, each in the format you specified for the row you inserted manually in the Mongo shell. The `insert_many()` method takes a list of documents (in this case, a list of dictionaries) and inserts them into the collection.
Note that the `insert_many()` method returns a list of insertion results, which you can use to retrieve the `_id` of the newly inserted documents. For example:

```

inserted_docs = db_collection.insert_many(data)


for doc in edits:


     print(""Inserted document _id:"", doc[""_id""])


```

This will print the `_id` of each newly inserted document.

If I wanted to insert all 250 rows into the database using PyMongo in Python, how would I ensure that every row is entered following the format that I used when I inserted it manually in the Mongo shell?
",,"To ensure that every row is entered following the format used when inserting it manually in the Mongo shell, you can create a Python script using PyMongo to insert the data. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:

1. First, make sure you have PyMongo installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install pymongo
```

2. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime
```

3. Connect to your MongoDB database:

```python
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['your_database_name']
collection = db['your_collection_name']
```

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name'` and `'your_collection_name'` with the actual names you want to use.

4. Define a function to insert a single row:

```python
def insert_row(row):
    collection.insert_one(row)
```

5. Iterate over your dataset and insert each row using the `insert_row` function:

```python
dataset = [
    # Your dataset of 250 rows goes here
]

for row in dataset:
    insert_row(row)
```

Make sure to replace `dataset` with your actual dataset containing 250 rows.

6. Run the script to insert the data into the MongoDB database.

This script will iterate over each row in your dataset and insert it into the MongoDB collection using the `insert_one` method provided by PyMongo. The format of each row should match the format you used when inserting the first row manually in the Mongo shell.

Note that in the example dataset you provided, the `date_assigned` field should be formatted as a string, not a date object. So you should update the date format in your dataset to something like `'01-15-2022'` before running the script.

By following these steps, you should be able to insert all 250 rows into the database using PyMongo in Python while ensuring that each row is entered following the desired format.",0.013287805020809174,"python, mongodb, pymongo",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with horizontal scrolling animations!
In order to create horizontal scrolling animations, you can use CSS transition or keyframes to animate the width of an element. Here's an example of how you can do it:
HTML:
```html
  <!-- Your content here -->
```
CSS:
```css
.container {
  width: 100vw; /* Set the width of the container to 100% of the viewport */
  height: 600px; /* Set the height of the container to 600px */
  overflow-y: scroll; /* Add scrollbar for vertical scrolling */
  /* Now let's add horizontal scrolling */
  .slide-container {
    position: relative; /* Make the slide container a relative position element */
    width: 0; /* Set the initial width of the slide container to 0 */
    transition: width 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Add a transition to the width property for a smooth animation */
    &.slide-in {
      width: 100%; /* Set the width of the slide container to 100% when the slide is in view */
      transform: translateX(0); /* Move the slide to the left edge of the container */
      /* Add the slide animation using the .slide-in class */
    }
    &.slide-out {
      width: 0; /* Set the width of the slide container to 0 when the slide is out of view */
      transform: translateX(-100%); /* Move the slide to the right edge of the container */
    }
  }
```
In this example, we've added a `position: relative` property to the `.slide-container` element to make it a relative position element, which allows us to position the slide absolute to it.
We've also added a `width` property to the `.slide-container` element and assigned it a value of `0`. This will create a horizontal scrolling animation when the slide is scrolled into or out of view.
To achieve the horizontal scrolling animation, we've used the `.slide-in` and `.slide-out` classes. These classes use the `transition` property to smoothly animate the width of the slide container from 0 to 100% or from 100% to 0, respectively.
You can add more styles to the `.slide-in` and `.slide-out` classes to customize the animation, such as adding a delay or adjusting the duration of the animation.
Here's a Codepen example of the code I provided: <https://codepen.io/team/freeCodeCamp/full/QWRwVGM/>
In this example, you can see how the slide container animates horizontally when the slide is scrolled into or out of view. You can adjust the transition duration and other styles to suit your needs.

","To achieve horizontal scrolling animations while scrolling vertically, you can use a combination of JavaScript and CSS. One approach is to listen for the scroll event and calculate the scroll position. Based on the scroll position, you can update the position of the elements that you want to animate horizontally.

Here's an example of how you can implement this using JavaScript and CSS:

HTML:
```html
<div class=""scroll-container"">
  <div class=""scroll-item"">Item 1</div>
  <div class=""scroll-item"">Item 2</div>
  <div class=""scroll-item"">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.scroll-container {
  width: 100%;
  overflow-x: scroll;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.scroll-item {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  margin-right: 20px;
  background-color: #ccc;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.scroll-item.active {
  transform: translateX(200px);
}
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
const scrollContainer = document.querySelector('.scroll-container');
const scrollItems = document.querySelectorAll('.scroll-item');

function handleScroll() {
  const scrollPosition = scrollContainer.scrollLeft;

  scrollItems.forEach((item) => {
    const itemOffset = item.offsetLeft;
    const scrollOffset = itemOffset - scrollPosition;

    if (scrollOffset < window.innerWidth) {
      item.classList.add('active');
    } else {
      item.classList.remove('active');
    }
  });
}

scrollContainer.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

In this example, we have a container with a horizontal scrollbar (`.scroll-container`) and multiple items (`.scroll-item`) inside it. The `handleScroll` function is called whenever the container is scrolled. It calculates the scroll position and updates the position of the items based on their offset and the scroll position.

By adding the `.active` class to the items within the visible window (`window.innerWidth`), we can apply CSS transitions or animations to create the horizontal sliding effect.

","  Based on the given dataframes `df1` and `df2`, you want to update the `QTY` value in `df1` based on the `Week` column in `df2`. You've tried using the `melt` function to reshape `df2` and then using the `merge` function to join them, but you're getting an error message saying that the `grouper` is not 1-dimensional.
Here's another approach to solve this problem:
1. Use the `merge` function to join the dataframes on the `Week` column.
```scss
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='Week')
```
This will create a new dataframe `merged_df` that contains all the rows from `df1` and `df2`.
2. Melt the `merged_df` dataframe to reshape it into a long format, where the `Week` column is now a column instead of a row.
```scss
melted_df = pd.melt(merged_df, id_vars=['Part', 'Week'], variable_name='QTY')
```
This will create a new dataframe `melted_df` that has the same structure as the original `df1`, but with the `QTY` values updated based on the values in `df2`.
To update the `QTY` values in `df1`, you can use the following code:
```scss
df1['QTY'] = df1['QTY'].replace(df2['QTY'])
```
This will replace the `QTY` values in `df1` with the corresponding values from `df2`.
Here's the complete code:
```scss
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataframes
df1 = pd.read_csv('df1.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('df2.csv')

# Merge the dataframes on the Week column
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='Week')

# Melt the merged dataframe to reshape it into a long format
melted_df = pd.melt(merged_df, id_vars=['Part', 'Week'], variable_name='QTY')

# Update the QTY values in df1
df1['QTY'] = melted_df['QTY']

```
This should give you the expected output. Note that I've assumed that the file names for the dataframes are `df1.csv` and `df2.csv`. If they're different, you'll need to update the code accordingly.",0.687021017074585,"python, pandas, dataframe",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To update the 'qty' values in 'df1' based on the 'part' and 'week' columns in 'df2', you can use the `merge` function in pandas. Here's how you can do it:

df1 = df1.merge(df2[['ITM_NO', 'WEEK', 'QTY']], left_on='Part', right_on='ITM_NO', how='left')
df1.update(df1.pop('QTY_y'))
df1.columns = df1.columns.str.replace('_x', '')
df1 = df1.drop('ITM_NO', axis=1)

print(df1)

    });
    spy.calls.reset();
  }));

This is my code coverage

","Multiple issues here. You actually have to subscribe to this.parents$ to execute the map, which makes your test async. In your test, you're subscribing on the result of parentsM(), which I guess doesn't return exactly this.parents$, so you're not subscribing to the pipe you wrote. You may also use waitForAsync instead of async.
Please try this:
it(&quot;getParents with siteId&quot;, waitForAsync(() =&gt; { // &lt;== waitForAsync
      const mockItems:Response = {
      codError: &quot;&quot;,
      msgError: &quot;&quot;,
      data: &quot;test&quot;}

    component.getParents();
    component.parents$.subscribe(items =&gt; { // &lt;== parents$
      expect(items).toEqual(mockItems);
    });
    
    spy.calls.reset();
}));

","  To fix the problem of not being able to get into the map inside the pipe, you need to use the `async` and `await` keywords in your test to synchronize the execution of the pipe.
Here's an updated version of your test that should work:
it(""getParents with siteId"", async() => {
    const mockItems: Response = {
    codError: """",
    msgError: """",
    data: ""test""

    let spy = spyOn<any>(component, ""parentsM"").and.returnValue(scheduled([mockItems], asyncScheduler));
    component.getParents();
    await component.parentsM().toPromise(); // Important!
    component.parentsM().subscribe(items => {
      expect(items).toEqual(mockItems);
    });

    spy.calls.reset();
  });

In this updated test, we use the `await` keyword to wait for the pipe to complete its execution before calling the `toPromise()` method on its observable. This allows the code inside the map function to be executed after the pipe has been created and its subscription has been set up.
Without the `await` keyword, the code inside the map function would be executed before the pipe has been created, and therefore it would not be possible to access the `items` variable.
Also, as a best practice, you should remove the `toPromise()` method call and use the `async` and `await` keywords directly in your test, like this:
it(""getParents with siteId"", async() => {
    const mockItems: Response = {
    codError: """",
    msgError: """",
    data: ""test""

    let spy = spyOn<any>(component, ""parentsM"").and.returnValue(scheduled([mockItems], asyncScheduler));
    component.getParents();
    await component.parentsM(); // Important!
    component.parentsM().subscribe(items => {
      expect(items).toEqual(mockItems);
    });

    spy.calls.reset();

","To test the map inside the pipe in Angular, you can use the `async` and `fakeAsync` utilities provided by Angular's testing framework. Here's an example of how you can modify your spec.ts code to test the map inside the pipe:

```typescript
import { async, ComponentFixture, fakeAsync, TestBed, tick } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, map } from 'rxjs/operators';

describe('Component', () => {
  let component: YourComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<YourComponent>;

  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [YourComponent]
    }).compileComponents();
  }));

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(YourComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });

  it('should test map inside the pipe', fakeAsync(() => {
    const mockItems = {
      codError: '',
      msgError: '',
      data: 'test'
    };

    spyOn(component, 'parentsM').and.returnValue(of(mockItems)); // Mock the parentsM method to return the mockItems

    component.getParents(); // Call the method that contains the pipe with map

    tick(); // Simulate the passage of time for the asynchronous operation to complete

    expect(component.parents$).toBeDefined(); // Check if parents$ has been assigned a value

    component.parents$.subscribe(items => {
      expect(items).toEqual(mockItems.data); // Test the value inside the map
    });
  }));
});
```

In this example, we use `spyOn` to mock the `parentsM` method and make it return the `mockItems` object. Then, we call the `getParents` method, which triggers the asynchronous operation inside the pipe. We use `fakeAsync` and `tick` to simulate the passage of time and make the asynchronous operation complete. Finally, we subscribe to `parents$` and test the value inside the map using `expect`.",0.6608494520187378,"angular, dictionary, testing, jasmine, pipe",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Certainly! It seems that you are experiencing a problem with loading the 'ecospat' package in R because the version of 'biomod2' you are trying to load is not compatible with your version of R (4.2.1).
There are a few ways to address this issue:
1. Upgrade to a newer version of R: As you mentioned, the latest version of 'biomod2' (4.1-2) is not available for your version of R (4.2.1). You can try upgrading to a newer version of R to install a compatible version of 'biomod2'.
2. Downgrade to an older version of 'biomod2': If you cannot upgrade to a newer version of R, you can try downgrading to an older version of 'biomod2' that is compatible with your version of R. For example, you can try installing 'biomod2' version 3.4.2, which is compatible with R version 4.2.1.
3. Use a different package: If you are unable to install a compatible version of 'biomod2', you can try using a different package for functional programming in R. There are several alternative packages available, such as 'functional', 'purrr', or 'rlang', which may be compatible with your version of R.
4. Contact the package maintainer: If none of the above options work, you can try contacting the maintainer of the 'biomod2' package to see if they have a solution for your issue.
Here is some additional information that may be helpful:
* The 'biomod2' package is written in R and relies on the R runtime environment. This means that the version of R you are running determines the version of 'biomod2' that you can use.
* The error message you see when trying to load 'ecospat' suggests that the version of 'biomod2' you are trying to use (version 4.1-2) is not compatible with your version of R (4.2.1).
* The 'biomod2' package is available on CRAN, which means it is actively maintained and updated. If you are experiencing issues with a particular version of 'biomod2', you may want to try the latest version available on CRAN.
* If you are trying to install an older version of 'biomod2', you may need to use the 'install.packages' function with the 'depends' argument set to the version of R you are using. For example, you can try installing 'biomod2' version 3.5.1 using the following command: install.packages('D:/Descargas/biomod2_3.5.1', depends = 'R_4.2')

","Deploy the public directory instead of build
","  Thank you for providing detailed information about the issue you're facing. Based on what you've described, it seems like you've successfully initialized a new Firebase project and configured it to host your React website. However, the deployed website is still showing the welcome page instead of your actual website. Here are some potential solutions you could try:
1. Check the Firebase hosting configuration: Make sure that the `published` field in the `firebase.json` file is set to `false` or `null`. This will tell Firebase not to publish the website by default. If you've already published the website, you can try setting `published` to `true` to see if that makes a difference.
2. Clear the Firebase cache: Sometimes, Firebase can cache the website's files and prevent them from being updated. You can try running the `firebase deploy --only hosting` command with the `--force` flag to force Firebase to update the cache.
3. Check the website's configuration: Make sure that the `build/index.html` file is correctly configured to point to the correct entry point of your React application. You can try opening the file in a text editor and checking that the `home` or ` IndexPage` component is correctly linked to the correct entry point.
4. Try a different entry point: If the `build/index.html` file is not working, you can try setting a different entry point for your React application. For example, you can set the `home` field in the `firebase.json` file to the URL of your React application's `index.js` file.
5. Check for typos in the `firebase.json` file: Make sure that there are no typos in the `firebase.json` file, especially in the `hosting` field.
6. Try resetting Firebase: If none of the above solutions work, you can try resetting Firebase by running the following command: `firebase init --reset`. This will reset your Firebase project to its default state and may fix any configuration issues that you're experiencing.
If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your React application, including its structure and any relevant configuration files.

","Deploy the public directory instead of build
","Based on the information provided, it seems like your React website is not being properly deployed on Firebase Hosting. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Verify the build folder: Make sure that the build folder generated by running `npm run build` contains all the necessary files for your React website. Double-check that the `index.html` file is present in the build folder.

2. Check the public directory setting: During the `firebase init` process, you selected the `build` folder as your public directory. Confirm that the `firebase.json` file in your project directory contains the correct configuration:

```json
{
  ""hosting"": {
    ""public"": ""build"",
    ...
  }

3. Ensure proper routing: Since you have configured your React website as a single-page app, you need to make sure that all URLs are rewritten to `index.html`. This enables your React app to handle routing correctly. Verify that the following configuration is present in your `firebase.json` file:

```json
{
  ""hosting"": {
    ...
    ""rewrites"": [
      {
        ""source"": ""**"",
        ""destination"": ""/index.html""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

4. Check Firebase project configuration: Ensure that the Firebase project you are using is correctly linked to your Firebase Hosting. You can verify this by running `firebase use --add` and selecting the correct project.

5. Clean and redeploy: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try cleaning up your project directory by removing the `build` folder, `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, and any other Firebase-related files. Then, run `firebase init` again, making sure to select the correct options and configuration. Finally, rebuild your project with `npm run build` and deploy with `firebase deploy --only hosting`.

If you still encounter the same issue after following these steps, it might be helpful to review the Firebase Hosting documentation and consider reaching out to the Firebase support team for further assistance.",0.18498072028160095,"reactjs, firebase, firebase-hosting, firebase-cli",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Of course! You can use a negative lookahead assertion with a capturing group to match URLs outside square brackets. Here's a regex pattern that should work for you:
```regex
(?< URLs>((?:\[[^\[\]]*\])|([^ \t\r\n()<>\]+)))
```
Here's how it works:
* The first part of the pattern is a negative lookahead assertion `(?!``` that matches if the URL is enclosed in square brackets. The `[\)` in the lookahead pattern matches any character in the square brackets.
* The second part of the pattern is a non-capturing group `(?< URLs>` that matches any URL inside the square brackets or any URL outside of them. The `(` and `)` in the non-capturing group match any character except for a square bracket.
* The entire pattern is captured in the `URLs` group, which you can use to extract the matches later.
Here's an example of how you can use this pattern in PHP:
```php
$text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur [http://example.com.nz] llamcorper et lacus. Morbi sodales convallis lectus a efficitur: example.com/first/second vitae nisl placerat.
Fusce non ipsum a augue http://example.com.nz http://www.example.com?2rjl6 aculis augue. Nullam eu nulla lectus.';

print_r($matches[0]);
```
This code will match all URLs in the text and capture them in the `$matches[0]` array. Make sure to use the `i` flag at the end of the pattern to make the regex case-insensitive.

","To fix the problem, you can modify the regex pattern to exclude URLs enclosed in square brackets. Here's an updated regex pattern that should meet your requirements:

```
(?<!\[)((http(s)?:\/\/(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&\/\/=]*)))(?!\])
```

Let's break down the changes:

1. `(?<!\[)` is a negative lookbehind assertion that ensures the URL is not preceded by a '[' character.
2. `((http(s)?:\/\/(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&\/\/=]*)))` is the regex pattern for matching URLs. It remains the same.
3. `(?!\])` is a negative lookahead assertion that ensures the URL is not followed by a ']' character.

By adding these lookbehind and lookahead assertions, the updated regex pattern will only match URLs that are not enclosed in square brackets.

Here's an example of how you can use this pattern in PHP:

```php
$text = ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur [http://example.com.nz] llamcorper et lacus. Morbi sodales convallis lectus a efficitur: example.com/first/second vitae nisl placerat.
Fusce non ipsum a augue http://example.com.nz  http://www.example.com?2rjl6 aculis augue. Nullam eu nulla lectus."";

$pattern = '/(?<!\[)((http(s)?:\/\/(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&\/\/=]*)))(?!\])/';
preg_match_all($pattern, $text, $matches);

$urlMatches = $matches[0];
$numMatches = count($urlMatches);

echo ""Number of matches: $numMatches\n"";
foreach ($urlMatches as $match) {
    echo $match . ""\n"";
}
```

This will output:

```
Number of matches: 3

","  The problem you're encountering with Ghostscript replacing embedded fonts is due to the way the software handles missing fonts. When you use the `gs` command with the `-dPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1` option, Ghostscript tries to preserve the fonts specified in the PDF file's font catalog, even if they're not found on the system.
To prevent Ghostscript from replacing embedded fonts, you can use the `-dNoSubstituteFonts` option. This option tells Ghostscript not to substitute any fonts that are not found on the system.
Here's an updated `gs` command that includes the `-dNoSubstituteFonts` option:
```
&quot;gswin64c.exe -I &quot;C:/Program Files/gs/gs9.56.1/Resource/Init&quot; -sFONTMAP=&quot;Fontmap.GS&quot; -dNOSAFER -dPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1 -sColorConversionStrategy=LeaveColorUnchanged -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=&quot;pdfwrite&quot; -dAutoRotatePages=/None -dPDFA=3 -sOutputFile=&quot;pdfa.pdf&quot; &quot;original.pdf&quot; -dNoSubstituteFonts
```
This should fix the issue with Ghostscript replacing the embedded fonts.
Regarding the ArialMT font, it's possible that the path you specified in the `Fontmap.GS` file is not correctly configured. Make sure that the path to the ArialMT font is correct and that it's included in the `Fontmap.GS` file.
Here are some additional tips to troubleshoot the issue:
1. Check the path to the ArialMT font in the `Fontmap.GS` file. Make sure that it's correctly configured and that it's included in the `Fontmap.GS` file.
2. Verify that the ArialMT font is installed on the system and that it's available in the `C:\Windows\Fonts` directory (or other default font directory).
3. Try adding the `-dBATCH` option to the `gs` command. This can help suppress some of the debugging messages that may be causing issues with the font substitution.
4. If you're still encountering issues, try removing the `-dPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1` option and see if that resolves the issue. This option is intended to preserve PDF fonts, but it may not be necessary in your case.

If I save the file from Acrobat the file size drops but the same issues reside
","The issue you are facing with Ghostscript replacing embedded fonts can be caused by several factors. Here are a few possible reasons and solutions:

1. Font substitution: Ghostscript has a built-in font substitution mechanism that replaces missing fonts with available ones. In your case, Ghostscript might be substituting the ArialMT font with NimbusSans-Regular because it cannot find the ArialMT font on your system. To prevent font substitution, you can use the `-dNOFONTMAP` option in your command to disable the font mapping.

2. Font configuration: Ghostscript relies on font configuration files to locate and load fonts. Make sure that the font configuration files are correctly set up and point to the correct font directories. You can check the `Fontmap.GS` file to ensure that the path to the ArialMT font is correctly specified.

3. Font file issues: The error message you provided indicates that there might be an issue with the font file itself. It's possible that the embedded ArialMT font is corrupted or not compatible with Ghostscript. You can try replacing the font file with a different version or ensuring that the font file is valid and compatible.

4. Ghostscript version: It's worth checking if you are using the latest version of Ghostscript. Upgrading to the latest version might resolve any known issues or bugs related to font handling.

5. PDF file issues: The PDF file you are processing might contain errors or inconsistencies that cause Ghostscript to fail in handling the fonts. You can try using tools like Adobe Acrobat or other PDF validation tools to check for any issues with the PDF file's structure or font embedding.

It's important to note that without having access to the actual PDF file, it can be challenging to provide an exact solution. If none of the above suggestions work, you might consider reaching out to the Ghostscript community or providing more specific details about the PDF file and the font setup for further assistance.",0.6061620712280273,ghostscript,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  Of course! I'd be happy to help you achieve your desired result in Google Sheets. Based on your provided image, it seems like you have a column of values in column A, and you want to pull the values from column B if the corresponding value in column A is not empty.
Here's how you can use the QUERY function to achieve this:
1. Select the cell where you want to display the result. Let's say it's cell B2.
2. Type the following formula:
`=QUERY(A:A,""SELECT B WHERE A Is Not empty"")`
This formula will pull all the values from column B, where the corresponding value in column A is not empty.
Here's a breakdown of the formula:
* `A:A` refers to the range of cells in column A.
* `SELECT B` specifies that we want to pull the values from column B.
* `WHERE A Is Not empty` filters the data to only include rows where the value in column A is not empty.
3. Press Enter to execute the formula.
4. The result should appear in the selected cell (in this case, cell B2).

You can also use a shorter syntax by using the `QUERY` function without specifying the range:
`=QUERY(A, ""SELECT B WHERE A Is Not empty"")`
This should give you the same result.

","To achieve the desired result of extracting values from one column based on the presence of something in another column, you can use the QUERY function in Google Sheets. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:

Assuming your data is in columns A and B, and you want to extract values from column A if column B contains a specific value, you can use the following formula in cell B2:

=QUERY(A:B, ""select A where B contains 'something'"", 0)

This formula will extract values from column A if column B contains the word ""something"". You can replace 'something' with any specific value you want to search for.

If you want to achieve the B structure in your example, where the extracted values are listed vertically in column B, you can use the following formula in cell B2:

=TRANSPOSE(QUERY(A:B, ""select A where B contains 'something'"", 0))

This formula will extract the values from column A and transpose them vertically in column B.

Similarly, if you want to achieve the C structure in your example, where the extracted values are listed horizontally in row 2, you can use the following formula in cell B2:

=QUERY(A:B, ""select A where B contains 'something' label A ''"", 0)

This formula will extract the values from column A and display them horizontally in row 2. The ""label A ''"" part is used to remove the column header.

Remember to adjust the range and search criteria ('something') based on your actual data.

","  The issue with your query is that you are using the `LIMIT` clause in the subquery, which is only applied to the subquery results, not to the outer query results. This means that the subquery is only returning one row, and the `LIMIT` clause is limiting the number of rows returned in that row, resulting in only one row being returned for the entire query.
To fix this, you can move the `LIMIT` clause to the outer query, after the `JOIN` clauses, like this:
SELECT post.*, user.u_name, files.f_url
FROM TABLE_USER_POST post
INNER JOIN TABLE_USERS user
ON user.uid = post.p_uid
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT f_url, f_uid

        ORDER BY fid DESC
    LIMIT 20
) files
ON files.f_uid = post.p_uid
ORDER BY post.pid DESC

This will return all the rows from the tables, and the `LIMIT` clause will limit the number of rows returned in the final result.
Also, you may want to consider using `JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN` if you want to return all the rows from the tables, even if there is no match in the `FILES` table.
Lastly, you have a typo in the `WHERE` clause, it should be `f_path` instead of `f_url`.

","The problem with your query is that the left join subquery is only returning one row, even though you want to select only one row per user. To achieve the desired result, you can modify the query as follows:

```
SELECT post.pid, post.p_name, post.p_uid, user.u_name, files.f_url
FROM TABLE_USER_POST post

INNER JOIN TABLE_USERS user
ON user.uid = post.p_uid

LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT f_url, f_uid
    FROM (
        SELECT f_url, f_uid
        FROM TABLE_USER_FILES
        WHERE f_path = 'gallery'
        ORDER BY fid DESC
    ) AS temp
    GROUP BY f_uid
) files
ON files.f_uid = post.p_uid

ORDER BY post.pid DESC 
LIMIT 0, 20
```

In this modified query, a subquery is added to select the latest file for each user by grouping the result of the inner subquery by `f_uid`. This ensures that only one row per user is selected from the `TABLE_USER_FILES` table.

Now, the query should return the expected result:

","For first example do:

You are assigning to the NEW.animal_id not setting anything. FYI, := can also be used for assignment.
","  Thank you for providing the details of your issue. Based on the information you provided, I can see that you are trying to create a PostgreSQL trigger function that will concatenate the `species`, `capture_year`, and `tag_num` columns to create a unique `animal_id` field for each row inserted or updated in the `capt_trial` table.
From your error messages, it seems that the issue is related to the syntax of the concatenation operation in the trigger function. Specifically, PostgreSQL is complaining that it cannot find the `species` column in the `values` clause of the trigger function.
Here are a few possible ways to fix the issue:
1. Use double quotes around the `species` column name:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_short_animal_id_1()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$
BEGIN
    SET NEW.animal_id = CONCAT(species, '-', capture_year, '-', tag_num);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
This will allow PostgreSQL to recognize the `species` column name as a string literal, rather than trying to find a column with that name in the current table.
2. Qualify the `species` column name with the table name:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_short_animal_id_1()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$
BEGIN
    SET NEW.animal_id = CONCAT(capt_trial.species, '-', capture_year, '-', tag_num);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
This will ensure that PostgreSQL looks up the `species` column in the `capt_trial` table, rather than trying to find a column with that name in the current table.
3. Use a function call to concatenate the strings:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_short_animal_id_1()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$
BEGIN
    SET NEW.animal_id = CONCAT(fn_concat_strings(species, capture_year, tag_num));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
CREATE FUNCTION fn_concat_strings(str1 text, str2 text, str3 text)
RETURNS text
AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN str1 || '-' || str2 || '-' || str3;
END;
This will allow you to separate the concatenation operation into a separate function, which can make the code easier to read and maintain.

You are assigning to the NEW.animal_id not setting anything. FYI, := can also be used for assignment.
","In scenario #1, the error is occurring because you are using the `SET` statement incorrectly. In PostgreSQL, you cannot use `SET` to assign values to a column directly within a trigger function. Instead, you should assign the value directly to the `NEW` record variable. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_short_animal_id_1()

BEGIN
    NEW.animal_id := CONCAT(NEW.species, '-', NEW.capture_year, '-', NEW.tag_num);

In scenario #2, the error is occurring because you are trying to insert values into the `capt_trial` table using the `INSERT INTO` statement within the trigger function. This is unnecessary because the trigger function is already executed before the insertion or update happens. You don't need to insert the values again. Here's the corrected version of the function:

73630660,PySimpleGUI Combo: Bind key/value pair array or get selected index?,"I'm really astounded that there doesn't seem to be a way to bind a dictionary or key/value pair array to a simple dropdownlist that the Combo element is supposed to cover. The contents of a given Combo in my app is fetched from the database and I would like to know the primary key of any item that is selected from said Combo. However, it only seems possible to populate the Combo with a list of strings, so everytime I tried to &quot;get&quot; the item, the name string is all I've got left.
A temporary workaround where I fetch the source item from the database based on the name string is tenuous at best, as there's no guarantee that I'm getting the actual item and not some alternative that happens to have the same name. Also, it would be unneccesary to do another database trip, when you've already just fetched all the items!
A more reliable workaround where I keep the table rows in memory and then look up the row using the selected index, also falls short, because, in contrast with pysimplegui's Listbox element, you cannot get the selected item's index of a Combo!!!
What gives!? I'm about to completely give up on PySimpleGUI in favour of a (hopefully) better alternative. If you know of any, I would regard that as an answer to my question also.

","  I understand your problem, and I apologize that you're facing this issue with PySimpleGUI's Combo element. As you mentioned, there doesn't seem to be a built-in way to bind a dictionary or key/value pair array to a Combo.
However, there are a few possible solutions you can consider, depending on your requirements and the structure of your data:
1. Populating the Combo with a list of dictionaries:
One potential solution is to populate the Combo with a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a item in your database. You can then access the value of the selected item by looking up the dictionary key in the list. Here's an example:
import PySimpleGUI as sg

data = [ {'id': 1, 'name': 'Item 1', 'spid': 123},
 {'id': 2, 'name': 'Item 2', 'spid': 456},
 {'id': 3, 'name': 'Item 3', 'spid': 789} ]

layout = [[sg.Text('collections'), sg.Combo(data, enable_events=True, key='cbxCollections', size=(30, 1))],]
window = sg.Window('testing', layout)

while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break
    elif event =='cbxCollections':
        text = values[event]
        index = window[event].widget.current()
        id = data[index]['id']  # Access the value of the selected item
        print(index, id, repr(values[event]))

window.close()

.

This way, you can store the items in a list of dictionaries, and access the value of the selected item by looking up the dictionary key in the list. You can then use the `repr()` function to convert the dictionary to a string for printing.
1. Using a custom delegate function:
Another option is to create a custom delegate function for the Combo element that allows you to access the value of the selected item. Here's an example:
import PySimpleGUI as sg

def delegate_cbxCollections(element, value):
    if element.get('key') == 'cbxCollections':
        # Get the selected item from the data list
        selected_item = data[element.widget.current()]

        # Return the value of the selected item
        return selected_item['id']

layout = [[sg.Text('collections'), sg.Combo(data, enable_events=True, key='cbxCollections', size=(30, 1), delegate=delegate_cbxCollections)],]

window = sg.Window('testing', layout)

while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break
    elif event =='cbxCollections':
        text = values[event]
        index = window[event].widget.current()
        id = delegate_cbxCollections(element=window[event], value=text)
        print(index, id, repr(values[event]))

window.close()

.

In this example, the `delegate_cbxCollections()` function is called whenever the user selects a new item from the Combo. The function returns the value of the selected item, which you can then use as desired.
1. Using a combination of events and callbacks:
Finally, you can use a combination of events and callbacks to achieve your goal. You can define a callback function that is triggered whenever the selected item changes, and then use this function to fetch the value of the selected item from your database. Here's an example:
import PySimpleGUI as sg

def on_ selection_change(event, values):
    # Get the selected item index
    selected_index = values['cbxCollections'].widget.current()

    # Fetch the value of the selected item from the database
    id = fetch_item_id(selected_index)

    # Print the value of the selected item
    print(repr(id))

layout = [[sg.Text('collections'), sg.Combo(data, enable_events=True, key='cbxCollections', size=(30, 1)),],]

window = sg.Window('testing', layout)

def fetch_item_id(index):
    # Fetch the item ID from the database
    pass

# Define the window and add the event listener
window = sg.Window('testing', layout)
window.bind(on_selection_change,('cbxCollections'))

while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break

window.close()


.

In this example, you define a `fetch_item_id()` function that fetches the value of the selected item from your database. The `on_selection_change()` function is triggered whenever the selected item changes, and it calls the `fetch_item_id()` function to retrieve the value of the selected item. You can then use the `repr()` function to convert the result to a string for printing.
I hope these suggestions help you achieve your goal. Let me know if you have any further questions!",0.7384727001190186,"python, combobox, pysimplegui, selectedindex",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73630660,PySimpleGUI Combo: Bind key/value pair array or get selected index?,"I'm really astounded that there doesn't seem to be a way to bind a dictionary or key/value pair array to a simple dropdownlist that the Combo element is supposed to cover. The contents of a given Combo in my app is fetched from the database and I would like to know the primary key of any item that is selected from said Combo. However, it only seems possible to populate the Combo with a list of strings, so everytime I tried to &quot;get&quot; the item, the name string is all I've got left.
A temporary workaround where I fetch the source item from the database based on the name string is tenuous at best, as there's no guarantee that I'm getting the actual item and not some alternative that happens to have the same name. Also, it would be unneccesary to do another database trip, when you've already just fetched all the items!
A more reliable workaround where I keep the table rows in memory and then look up the row using the selected index, also falls short, because, in contrast with pysimplegui's Listbox element, you cannot get the selected item's index of a Combo!!!
What gives!? I'm about to completely give up on PySimpleGUI in favour of a (hopefully) better alternative. If you know of any, I would regard that as an answer to my question also.

EDIT: Thanks to Jason Yang's Answer I arrived at the following:
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Internal 
import data_access as db
import util

collections = db.getRows('collection')
collList = util.convert_dbrow_list(collections)

layout = [[sg.Text('collections'), sg.Combo(collList, enable_events=True, key='cbxCollections', size=(30, 1))],]
window = sg.Window('testing', layout)

while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break
    elif event =='cbxCollections':
        text = values[event]
        index = window[event].widget.current()
        id = collections[index]['id'] 
        spid = collections[index]['spid'] 
        print(index, id, spid, repr(values[event]))

window.close()

","You can use method current() for the widget of Combo element, or index the value of entry from the value list of Combo element.
import PySimpleGUI as sg

data = ['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four']

layout = [
    [sg.Combo(data, size=20, enable_events=True, key='COMBO')],
    [sg.Push(), sg.Button('Check')],
]
window = sg.Window('Title', layout)

while True:

    event, values = window.read()

    if event == sg.WIN_CLOSED:
        break
    elif event in ('COMBO', 'Check'):
        text = values['COMBO']
        index1 = window['COMBO'].widget.current()
        index2 = data.index(text) if text in data else -1
        print(index1, index2, repr(values['COMBO']))

window.close()

","The issue you're encountering with PySimpleGUI Combo can be resolved by using the `metadata` feature of the Combo element. 

Instead of binding a dictionary or a key/value pair array directly to the Combo, you can bind a list of strings to the Combo and store the corresponding key/value pairs in the `metadata` attribute of each item in the list.

Here's an updated version of your code that demonstrates this approach:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Internal 
import data_access as db
import util

collections = db.getRows('collection')
collList = [coll['name'] for coll in collections]

layout = [
    [sg.Text('collections'), sg.Combo(collList, enable_events=True, key='cbxCollections', size=(30, 1))]
]
window = sg.Window('testing', layout)

while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break
    elif event == 'cbxCollections':
        selected_index = values[event]
        selected_item = collections[selected_index]
        id = selected_item['id']
        spid = selected_item['spid']
        print(selected_index, id, spid, repr(values[event]))

window.close()
```

In this code, the `collList` variable contains a list of strings representing the names of the collections. When an item is selected in the Combo, the event handler retrieves the selected index from `values[event]`. Then, using the selected index, it fetches the corresponding item from the `collections` list and extracts the required key/value pairs.

By utilizing the `metadata` attribute, you can associate additional information with each item in the Combo and access it when needed. This approach ensures that you have access to the primary key of the selected item without the need for additional database trips or relying on matching name strings.

If you're still unsatisfied with PySimpleGUI, there are alternative GUI frameworks available for Python, such as Tkinter, PyQt, and wxPython. Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and features, so you can explore them to find the one that best suits your requirements.",0.7770649194717407,"python, combobox, pysimplegui, selectedindex",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Yes you can; however, the code you provided does not use locals.
Local usage would be:
&lt;%= render partial: 'campaigns_list', locals: { campaigns: @active_campaigns } %&gt;
And you can thus loop through campaigns within the partial.
Docs for locals
","  To achieve this, you can use a combination of locals and conditional rendering in your partial. Here's an example:
1. In your controller, define two instance variables, `active_campaigns` and `inactive_campaigns`, like this:
`@active_campaigns = @campaigns.where(status: 1).order(created_at: :desc)`
`@inactive_campaigns = @campaigns.where(status: 2).order(created_at: :desc)`
2. In your partial, use locals to pass the `active` and `inactive` campaigns to the partial, like this:
`<% @campaigns.each do |campaign| %>
    &lt;tr scope=&quot;row d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;% if campaign.status == 1 %>
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= campaign.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;% else %>
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= campaign.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;% end %>

 `</% end %>`
In this example, the `if campaign.status == 1` statement is used to render the `campaigns_list` partial for the `active` campaigns only. The `else` statement renders the same partial for the `inactive` campaigns.
3. In your `campaigns_list` partial, you can use the `locals` Ruby method to access the passed `active` or `inactive` campaigns, like this:
`<% local :active_campaigns = @active_campaigns %>`
`<% local :inactive_campaigns = @inactive_campaigns %>`
4. Use the `locals` variables in your partial template to render the campaign names, like this:
`<% @campaigns.each do |campaign| %>
    &lt;tr scope=&quot;row d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;% if :active_campaigns.include? campaign %>
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= campaign.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;% else %>
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= campaign.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;% end %>

 `</% end %>`
In this example, the `if` statement checks if the `campaign` object is included in the `active_campaigns` array, and renders the campaign name accordingly.
By using locals and conditional rendering in this way, you can achieve the same layout for both the `active` and `inactive` campaigns, but with different data displayed in each tab.",0.6841768622398376,ruby-on-rails,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To achieve your desired result of using the same partial with different variables for the loop in Rails, you can make use of the `locals` option when rendering the partial.

First, modify your partial to accept a local variable for the campaigns:

```ruby
<% campaigns.each do |campaign| %>
  <tr scope=""row d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center"">
    <!-- Rest of the code -->
  </tr>
<% end %>
```

Next, update your view to pass the respective variables to the partial using the `locals` option:

```ruby
<div class=""tab-content"" id=""pills-tabContent"">
  <div class=""tab-pane fade show active"" id=""pills-home"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-labelledby=""campaigns-active-tab"">
    <%= render partial: 'campaigns_list', locals: { campaigns: @active_campaigns } %>
  </div>
  <div class=""tab-pane fade"" id=""pills-profile"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-labelledby=""campaigns-inactive-tab"">
    <%= render partial: 'campaigns_list', locals: { campaigns: @inactive_campaigns } %>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now, within each tab, the `campaigns_list` partial will use the respective campaigns variable (`@active_campaigns` or `@inactive_campaigns`) passed as a local variable.

","  The errors you are experiencing with using concepts in C++20 are likely due to the fact that the C++20 concept syntax is still evolving and is not yet fully supported by all compilers, including Visual Studio 2022. Specifically, the `requires` clause in a concept definition is a new feature in C++20, and some compilers may not yet be able to parse it correctly.
To fix the syntax errors you are seeing, you can try the following:
1. Make sure you are using the latest version of the Visual Studio 2022 compiler. You can check for updates by going to 'Tools' > 'Get Tools and Features' in Visual Studio.
2. Try using the 'constexpr' keyword to define the concept. For example:
```
        template<typename T>
        concept has_type_member = requires { constexpr typename T::type; };
```
this should help the compiler understand that it is a concept definition and not a function call.
3. you can also try adding a 'namespace' before the concept definition, like this:
```
        namespace my_concepts {
            template<typename T>

This can help the compiler to understand that it is a concept definition and not a function call.
4. Make sure you are using the correct syntax for the concept name. The name of the concept should be a valid C++ identifier.
5. Check if you are missing a '{' or '}' in the concept definition.

Greetings, Flo
","  Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue.
From the information you've provided, it seems that the browser is displaying a ""Bad Request"" message instead of the error message returned by the API. This could be caused by a few different things:
1. CORS (Cross-Origin Security) issues: If the API is hosted on a different domain than the frontend code, the browser may block the error message from being displayed due to security restrictions. You can try adding CORS headers to the API or using a proxy to bypass these restrictions.
2. Response headers: The error message might be being overridden by the browser's default headers. You can try inspecting the response headers and adding a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json` to force the browser to display the error message in JSON format.
3. JSON serialization: If the error message is being returned in JSON format, it's possible that the browser is not properly serializing the data. You can try using `JSON.stringify` to convert the error message to a JSON string before returning it.
4. Frontend code: It's possible that the error message is being overridden in the frontend code. You can try adding the error message to the `response.success` or `response.error` property in the frontend code to ensure that it's displayed correctly.
To help further with troubleshooting, could you please provide:
1. The API endpoint code that returns the error message
2. The frontend code that handles the response from the API
3. The network request and response logs (from the developer tools) that show the error message being returned by the API and the browser's response.

Greetings, Flo
","Based on the information provided, it seems like you are receiving a ""Bad Request"" error message from the browser instead of the actual error message sent by the backend API. This can happen due to various reasons, but here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Check the HTTP status code: Firstly, ensure that the HTTP response status code is indeed 400 (Bad Request) and not some other code. You can do this by inspecting the network request in your browser's developer tools. If the status code is different, it might indicate a different issue altogether.

2. Inspect the response body: Look at the response body in the network request. Sometimes, the actual error message sent by the backend API can be found in the response body. It's possible that the browser is not displaying the message directly in the error message but rather in the response body.

3. CORS issues: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions can sometimes cause the browser to display generic error messages like ""Bad Request"" instead of the actual error message. Ensure that the backend API has the necessary CORS headers set correctly to allow requests from your frontend application.

4. Error handling in the frontend: Check how you are handling errors in your Angular application. Make sure you are correctly capturing and displaying the error message returned by the backend API. If you are using Angular's HttpClient, you can use the `error` callback of the `subscribe` method to capture and handle the error response.

5. Backend configuration: Review the backend code and configuration to ensure that the error message is being sent correctly in the response. Double-check the logic that generates the error message and ensure it is not being overwritten or modified before being sent to the frontend.

By investigating these points, you should be able to identify the issue and fix the problem of receiving a ""Bad Request"" instead of the actual error message from the backend API.",0.44057393074035645,"angular, error-handling, httpresponse, http-status-code-400, 400-bad-request",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

            item.getGlobalVisibleRect(itemBoundsRect)
            var itemSize = layoutManager!!.findViewByPosition(i)!!.width
            
            var visibleSize = 0
            if (indexes.size == 1) {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right
            } else {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right - itemBoundsRect!!.left
            }



            var visibilty = visibleSize * 100 / itemSize
            if (visibilty &gt; 0) {
                visibilty = 100 - visibilty
            }

            val viewHolder = findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
            viewHolder!!.itemView.alpha = (100 - visibilty).toFloat() / 100f
        }
    }
}

It doesn't work as expected as the opacity changes at the wrong time. The image below demonstrates this better. I expect the opacity to progressively begin to change when the item edges come out of the red box. However, it only starts when the item reaches the yellow edges.

Is there a way to achieve this effect?
Thank you :)
","Your code for calculateVisibility() is looking at global position when looking at the relative position within the RecyclerView is sufficient. Maybe there is more to the code than you posted, but try the following. This code looks at the x position of each visible view and calculates the alpha value as a function of displacement from the center of the RecyclerView. Comments are in the code.
private fun calculateVisibility(recycler: RecyclerView) {
    val midRecycler = recycler.width / 2
    val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = recycler.layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
    val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
    val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
    for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
        val viewHolder = recycler.findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
        viewHolder?.itemView?.apply {
            // This is the end of the view in the parent's coordinates
            val viewEnd = x + width
            // This is the maximum pixels the view can slide left or right until it disappears.
            val maxSlide = (midRecycler + width / 2).toFloat()
            // Alpha is determined by the percentage of the maximum slide the view has moved.
            // This assumes a linear fade but can be adjusted to fade in alternate ways.
            alpha = 1f - abs(maxSlide - viewEnd) / maxSlide
            Log.d(&quot;Applog&quot;, String.format(&quot;pos=%d alpha=%f&quot;, i, alpha))
        }
    }
}

The foregoing assumes that sizes remain constant.
","To fix the problem, you need to modify the `calculateVisibility()` method in the `CustomRecyclerView` class. Currently, the visibility is calculated based on the visible size of the item, but it should be based on the distance of the item edges from the center.

Here's an updated version of the `calculateVisibility()` method that should give you the desired effect:

```kotlin
private fun calculateVisibility() {
    val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
    val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
    val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
    val centerX = width / 2

    for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
        val item: View = layoutManager?.findViewByPosition(i) ?: continue
        val itemCenterX = (item.left + item.right) / 2

        val distanceFromCenter = Math.abs(itemCenterX - centerX)
        val maxDistance = width / 2 // half of the RecyclerView width
        val visibility = 1 - (distanceFromCenter.toFloat() / maxDistance)
        
        val viewHolder = findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
        viewHolder?.itemView?.alpha = visibility.coerceIn(0f, 1f)
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we calculate the distance of each item's center from the RecyclerView's center. Then, we calculate the visibility as a ratio of the distance from the center to the maximum distance (half of the RecyclerView width). Finally, we set the alpha value of the item's view based on the visibility.

Note that we use the `coerceIn()` function to ensure that the alpha value is always between 0 and 1.

With this modification, the opacity should progressively change as the item edges come out of the red box, giving you the desired effect.",0.8002170920372009,"android, kotlin, android-recyclerview, android-animation",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","  The problem you're encountering is related to the way you're handling the input from the user and converting it to a float value. Here are the issues in your code:
1. `age = input(""Please enter dog age"")`: This line of code is vulnerable to user input errors, as it raises a `NameError` when the user enters anything other than a number. To fix this, you can use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` exception that will arise if the user enters an invalid input.
2. `d_age = 0`: This line of code sets the default value of `d_age` to 0, but it's not needed in this case, as you're going to calculate the value of `d_age` based on the input provided later.
3. `try`: This block of code is only checking for a `ValueError` exception, but you're also going to encounter a `NameError` if the user enters an invalid input. To handle both types of errors, you can use a generic `except Exception: pass` block instead of a separate `try-except` block for each type of error.
4. `d_age = float(age)`: This line of code is where the error is occurring. The `age` variable can contain invalid float values, such as strings or integers, which will raise a `ValueError` when passed to the `float()` function. To fix this, you can use the `try)` function to convert the input to a float value before assigning it to `d_age`.
Here's the corrected code:
```python
def calculator():
    age = input(""Please enter dog age: "")
    try:
        d_age = float(age)
        # Check if the input is valid
        if d_age <= 0:
            raise ValueError(""Please enter a non-negative value"")
        elif d_age >= 5:
            d_age = (d_age - 5) * 7 + 36
        elif d_age <= 1:
            d_age = d_age * 15
        elif d_age <= 2:
            d_age = d_age * 12
        elif d_age <= 3:
            d_age = d_age * 9.3

","The issue you're facing is likely related to the way you're using the `input()` function in Python.

In your code, you have the following line: `age = input(""Please enter dog age "")`. The error you're encountering might occur when you're running this code in Python 2.x instead of Python 3.x.

```

","Just as kael said, you need to set the overflow property to visible for normal and mini variant. Like this:

  overflow: visible !important;

","  Ah, I see the issue. The `overflow-hidden` property is set on the `v-navigation-drawer` element, which prevents the drawer from overflowing. To fix this, you can remove the `overflow-hidden` property from the `v-navigation-drawer` element and set `overflow: auto` instead. Here's an updated example:
```html
  <v-navigation-drawer class=""drawer"" :model=""drawerState"" :disabled=""disabled"" :open.sync=""drawerOpen"">
    <div class=""drawer-content"">
        <slot v-if=""!drawerOpen"" />
      <slot v-else />
    </div>
  </v-navigation-drawer>
```
And the CSS:

```css
.v-navigation-drawer {
  overflow: auto;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out;
}

.v-navigation-drawer__content {
  overflow-x: auto;
}

```
This should allow the drawer to overflow the button and display the content correctly. You can also play around with the `transition` property in the CSS to fine-tune the animation when the drawer is opened or closed.
Regarding the button that is not getting hidden, it's probably because the button has a fixed position and the drawer is not fully opened. You can try adding `position: relative` to the `.v-navigation-drawer` class in the CSS to fix this issue.

","The issue you are facing with the v-navigation-drawer not allowing the toggle expand button to overflow can be resolved by modifying the CSS properties of the drawer and its content.

In your code, you are trying to remove the overflow hidden property by setting the overflow property of the v-navigation-drawer to ""auto"". However, this alone will not solve the issue.

To fix it, you need to make the following changes to your CSS:

1. Remove the ""overflow: hidden"" property from the .v-navigation-drawer class.
2. Add the ""position: relative"" property to the .v-navigation-drawer class.
3. Add the ""overflow: visible"" property to the .v-navigation-drawer__content class.

The updated CSS code should look like this:

```css
.v-navigation-drawer {
  position: relative;
}

.v-navigation-drawer__content {
  overflow: visible;
}
```

By making these changes, the toggle expand button will no longer be hidden and will overflow the drawer as expected.

","You can make Option into an iterator.

let jt = j.then_some([4, 5, 6]).into_iter().flatten();
let kt = k.then_some([7, 8, 9]).into_iter().flatten();

","  Yes, you can conditionally chain iterators in Rust using the built-in `iterator` method and the `match` keyword. Here's an example of how you can do this:
Let's say you have three tuples of numbers, `it`, `jt`, and `kt`, and you want to create an iterator that conditionally chains together `it`, `jt`, and `kt` based on three boolean conditions `i`, `j`, and `k`. You can do this using the following code:
```
let it = [1, 2, 3].into_iter();
let jt = [4, 5, 6].into_iter();
let kt = [7, 8, 9].into_iter();
let condition_i = i; // assume i is a boolean variable
let condition_j = j; // assume j is a boolean variable
let condition_k = k; // assume k is a boolean variable

let mut iter = it.chain(jt.map(|x| {
if condition_i {
    Some(x)
} else {
    // do something else with x
    None
})

iter.chain(kt.map(|x| {
    if condition_j {
        Some(x)
    } else {
        // do something else with x
        None
    }
}))

for x in iter {
    // do something with x
}
```

In this example, we first create three iterators `it`, `jt`, and `kt` from the tuples of numbers. We then define three boolean variables `i`, `j`, and `k` that determine which of the three iterators to use for each iteration. We use the `chain` method to conditionally chain together the iterators based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
The `map` method is used to transform each element of the iterators based on the condition. In this case, if `i` is true, we return `Some(x)`, otherwise we return `None`. The same logic is applied to `j` and `k`.
Finally, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the resulting iterator and perform some action on each element.
Note that the `chain` method returns a new iterator that chains together the two iterators based on the condition. If the condition is `true`, the first iterator is used, otherwise the second iterator is used. Similarly, the `map` method returns a new iterator that maps the elements of the original iterator based on the condition.",0.681139349937439,"rust, iterator",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Yes, you can conditionally chain iterators in Rust using the built-in Iterator functionality. To achieve this, you can use the `chain` method along with the `filter` method.

Here's an example of how you can conditionally chain the iterators `it`, `jt`, and `kt` together based on the boolean conditions `i`, `j`, and `k`:

```rust
let it = [1, 2, 3].into_iter();
let jt = [4, 5, 6].into_iter();
let kt = [7, 8, 9].into_iter();

    .chain(kt.filter(|_| k)); // conditionally chain kt based on k

for item in result {
    println!(""{}"", item); // prints only the items that meet the specified conditions
}
```

In this example, the `filter` method is used to conditionally filter out elements from the iterators based on the boolean conditions `i`, `j`, and `k`. The `chain` method is then used to chain the filtered iterators together.

The time range for the response is typically between 10 and 200 message cycles after the request, but can be longer in some cases. The actual time difference can be anywhere between 0 and 1250 message cycles, but the average time is around 60 to 100 message cycles.""

","The timing range for the response from a request in J1939 can vary depending on the specific implementation and the capabilities of the devices involved. However, there are some general guidelines that can help determine the possible range.

In J1939, the response to a request is typically sent using the PGN (Parameter Group Number) 0xEC00. The response can be more than 8 bytes in length, so it may require multiple data packets to transmit the complete response.

The timing of the response can be influenced by factors such as the network load, device processing capabilities, and the priority of the messages on the CAN bus.

The CAN bus has a fixed data rate, which is typically specified in terms of bits per second (bps). The data rate affects the timing of message transmission and reception on the bus.

To determine the possible range of the response timing, you can consider the following:

1. Data Packet Transmission Time: The time taken to transmit each data packet can be calculated based on the data rate of the CAN bus. For example, if the data rate is 250 kbps, each data packet of 8 bytes will take approximately 256 microseconds to transmit.

2. Number of Data Packets: The response may require multiple data packets to transmit the complete information. The number of data packets can vary depending on the size of the response. You can calculate the maximum number of data packets based on the size of the response and the maximum payload size for each data packet (usually 8 bytes).

3. Response Delay: The devices on the bus may introduce some delay in processing the request and generating the response. This delay can be influenced by factors such as the device's processing capabilities and the complexity of the requested operation.

Considering these factors, the possible range for the response timing from a request can vary. It can be anywhere from a few milliseconds to several hundred milliseconds, depending on the specific implementation and the characteristics of the network.

It's worth noting that the J1939 standard does not specify a specific range for the response timing. The timing requirements may be defined by the specific application or system requirements.",0.5803359746932983,"request, response, can-bus, j1939",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    }
}

","As part of the other work being done by whatever notificationAlarmIntent invokes, have it also call setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() for the next time you want to get control.
For example, you can put your setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() code in a utility function:

    val alarmManager = context.getSystemService(AlarmManager::class.java)

    val notificationAlarmIntent = Intent(

Then, in addition to wherever you are calling the existing AlarmManager code, you can call it from onReceive() of your NotificationAlarmReceiver:

","  It seems that the issue you're facing is that the `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method in AlarmManager doesn't have a `intervalMillis` parameter, which means you can't set the alarm to go off every day using this method.
However, there are a few workarounds you can use to achieve the desired behavior:
1. Use `setInexactRepeating` again: Although you mentioned that you were using `setInexactRepeating` previously and it worked, you can still use it again to achieve the desired behavior. The `setInexactRepeating` method takes the `AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP` permission, the time in milliseconds when the alarm should go off, and the interval between each alarm in milliseconds. You can use the `AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY` constant to set the interval between each alarm to a day.
Here's an example:
``` Java
notificationAlarmMgr?.setInexactRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, notificationCalendar.timeInMillis, AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY, notificationAlarmIntent)
```
2. Use aScheduled Timer: You can create a scheduled timer that will trigger the alarm every day at the same time. Here's an example:
``` Java
val stickyAlarmManager = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(notificationAlarmMgr!!, ""cancelAllOnPowerOff"").duration = 5000
val alarmManager = StickyAlarmManager(context).also {
    it.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, notificationCalendar.timeInMillis, AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY)
}

```
In this example, the `StickyAlarmManager` class is used to create a sticky alarm that will not be canceled when the device goes into power-saving mode. The `setRepeating` method is used to set the alarm to go off every day at the same time.
3. Use a Third-Party Library: You can use a third-party library that provides a `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method that works as expected. For example, you can use the `TimessuedAlarmManager` library, which provides a `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method that takes the `AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP` permission, the time in milliseconds when the alarm should go off, and the interval between each alarm in milliseconds.
Here's an example:
``` Java
import timessued.TimessuedAlarmManager

notificationAlarmMgr?.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, notificationCalendar.timeInMillis, notificationAlarmIntent, 1000)

```
In this example, the `TimessuedAlarmManager` class is used to create an alarm that will go off every day at the same time. The `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method takes the `AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP` permission, the time in milliseconds when the alarm should go off, and the interval between each alarm in milliseconds.
I hope one of these workarounds helps you achieve the desired behavior. Let me know if you have any further questions.",0.6989959478378296,"android, alarmmanager, android-alarms",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73587743,Android Alarm setExactAndAllowWhileIdle only triggers once,"I'm using the setExactAndAllowWhileIdle as follows:
notificationAlarmMgr?.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    notificationCalendar.timeInMillis,
    notificationAlarmIntent
)

Before I used setInexactRepeating and I was able to fire the alarm once everyday:
notificationAlarmMgr?.setInexactRepeating(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    notificationCalendar.timeInMillis,
    AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY,
    notificationAlarmIntent
)

setExactAndAllowWhileIdle doesn't have a intervalMillis parameter like setInexactRepeating does, so I can't pass AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY as an argument so that the alarm goes off everyday.
How do I make my alarm go off once everyday using setExactAndAllowWhileIdle?
Update 1:
More code for sending the alarm:
notificationAlarmIntent = Intent(
    context,
    NotificationAlarmReceiver::class.java
).let { intent -&gt;
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
        context,
        NOTIFICATION_ID,
        intent,
        PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
    )
}

The BroadcastReceiver() for the notification:
@RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
class NotificationAlarmReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        val i = Intent(context, SplashActivity::class.java).apply {
            flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK
        }

        val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(
            context,
            0,
            i,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        )

        val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, Constants.NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID)
            .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification_icon)
            .setColor(ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.colorPrimary))
            .setContentTitle(context.getString(R.string.notification))
            .setContentText(NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT)
            .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT)
            .setStyle(NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle().bigText(NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT))
            .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)
            .setAutoCancel(true)

        with(NotificationManagerCompat.from(context)) {
            notify(Constants.NOTIFICATION_NOTIFICATION_ID, builder.build())
        }
    }

    companion object {
        private val NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT: String by lazy { &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; }
    }
}

","As part of the other work being done by whatever notificationAlarmIntent invokes, have it also call setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() for the next time you want to get control.
For example, you can put your setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() code in a utility function:
fun setTheCottonPickinAlarm(context: Context, whenDoesItGoOff: Calendar) {
    val alarmManager = context.getSystemService(AlarmManager::class.java)

    val notificationAlarmIntent = Intent(
        context,
        NotificationAlarmReceiver::class.java
    ).let { intent -&gt;
        PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
            context,
            NOTIFICATION_ID,
            intent,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        )
    }

    alarmManager?.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
        AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
        whenDoesItGoOff.timeInMillis,
        notificationAlarmIntent
    )
}

Then, in addition to wherever you are calling the existing AlarmManager code, you can call it from onReceive() of your NotificationAlarmReceiver:
@RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
class NotificationAlarmReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        val i = Intent(context, SplashActivity::class.java).apply {
            flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK
        }

        val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(
            context,
            0,
            i,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        )

        val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, Constants.NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID)
            .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification_icon)
            .setColor(ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.colorPrimary))
            .setContentTitle(context.getString(R.string.notification))
            .setContentText(NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT)
            .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT)
            .setStyle(NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle().bigText(NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT))
            .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)
            .setAutoCancel(true)

        with(NotificationManagerCompat.from(context)) {
            notify(Constants.NOTIFICATION_NOTIFICATION_ID, builder.build())
        }

        setTheCottonPickinAlarm(context, calculateTheNextAlarmTime())
    }

    companion object {
        private val NOTIFICATION_CONTEXT_TEXT: String by lazy { &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; }
    }
}

(where you would supply the calculateTheNextAlarmTime() implementation, or add that logic to setTheCottonPickinAlarm() itself)
","The issue you are facing is because the `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` method does not have a built-in interval mechanism like `setInexactRepeating`. However, you can still achieve the desired functionality by manually rescheduling the alarm after it fires.

To make your alarm go off once every day using `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`, you can follow these steps:

1. Instead of using `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`, use `setExact` to trigger the alarm at the specific time you want.

```kotlin
notificationAlarmMgr?.setExact(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    notificationCalendar.timeInMillis,
    notificationAlarmIntent
)
```

2. In your `NotificationAlarmReceiver` class, after handling the alarm, reschedule the next alarm for the next day.

```kotlin
class NotificationAlarmReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        // Handle the alarm logic here

        // Reschedule the alarm for the next day
        val notificationAlarmMgr = context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE) as AlarmManager
        val notificationCalendar = Calendar.getInstance().apply {
            timeInMillis = System.currentTimeMillis()
            set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, desiredHour)
            set(Calendar.MINUTE, desiredMinute)
            add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, 1) // Add one day to the current date
        }

        notificationAlarmMgr.setExact(
            AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
            notificationCalendar.timeInMillis,
            notificationAlarmIntent
        )
    }
}
```

By manually rescheduling the alarm for the next day in the `onReceive` method of your `NotificationAlarmReceiver` class, you ensure that the alarm will go off once every day at the desired time.

Note: Replace `desiredHour` and `desiredMinute` with the specific hour and minute you want the alarm to trigger.

This way, even though `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` triggers the alarm only once, you are effectively achieving the desired functionality of firing the alarm once every day.",0.7664619088172913,"android, alarmmanager, android-alarms",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73422387,Sphinx: how to change the function signature display format?,"I have a sphinx theme that renders function signatures using italics rather than code.
(my_function(arg1, arg2) rather than my_function(arg1, arg2))
I'd like to change that behavior, but I'm not sure how... Any ideas?

.. automodule:: my_module
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

The theme in question is sphinx_material https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/, maybe I should just switch themes, but it's pretty except for function signatures being italicized rather than rendered as code.
For an example function documentation, see here: https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/pymethod.html?highlight=send_message
","Thanks to Steve and some more searching, I was able to do this:
See here for how to add custom CSS: How to add custom css file to Sphinx?
In my case, what I needed in the custom.css file was
@import 'material_sphinx.css';

.sig.sig-object.py{
    font-feature-settings: &quot;kern&quot;;
    font-family: &quot;Roboto Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;
    background: #f8f8f8;
}

","  Ah, I see! The Sphinx theme you're using, sphinx-material, uses a custom format for displaying function signatures, which is causing the issue. You can change this format by modifying the `function_signature` template in the theme.
Here are the steps to change the signature display format in sphinx-material:
1. Locate the `function_signature` template in the theme's `templates` directory. In the sphinx-material theme, it's located at `templates/function_signature.html`.
2. Open the template file and locate the line that renders the function signature. It should look something like this:
```html
<span class=""function-signature"">{{ func.ignation }}</span>
```
3. Modify the `class` attribute of the `span` element to be `function-signature-code` instead of `function-signature`. This will change the CSS class used to style the function signature, which should fix the issue.
Here's the modified template:
```html

<span class=""function-signature-code"">{{ func.ignation }}</span>
```
4. Save the template changes and rebuild your documentation with Sphinx. The new signature format should now be used throughout your documentation.
By changing the `function_signature` template, you should be able to control the formatting of function signatures in your documentation. If you want to stick with the sphinx-material theme and don't want to modify the template, you can at least change the CSS class used to style function signatures by adding the following rule to your theme's `local.css` file:
```css
.function-signature-code {
    font-weight: bold;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```
This will bold and underline the function signatures in your documentation, which may be more visible than the default format.

","The A in RGBA stands for Alpha, which is simply a value for opacity. Since this is the type needed for OpenAI, you should convert the plain RGB to RGBA leveraging an existing library. In python, I used the Python Image Library (PIL) convert function to complete this task.
","  The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the OpenAI library expects the input image to be in the RGBA format, but you're providing an RGB image. To fix this issue, you can simply convert your RGB image to RGBA by adding an alpha channel to it.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to provide an RGBA image:
1. Open your RGB image file using a library like ImageMagick or GMagick. For example, you can use the following command in PHP:
<?php
$image = new ImageMagick;
$image->read('otter.png');
?>
2. Add an alpha channel to the image by calling the `transparent` method and assigning it a value of `0`. For example:
<?php
$image->transparent(0);

?>
3. Call the `create` method on the `OpenAi` instance, passing the modified image as the input. For example:
<?php

$result = $open_ai-&gt;imageEdit([
    &quot;image&quot; =&gt; $image,
    &quot;prompt&quot; =&gt; &quot;A cute baby sea otter wearing a beret&quot;,

I thought looping through all the buttons in the view and checking their index could work, but it also seems a bit inefficient to do.
","Had to make some assumptions about the Question, and there are better ways one could structure this, but here's something that works.
This will mark an incorrect answer as red if selected and checked, and will mark the correct answer as green.
You would need to likely disable the buttons or progress after the check as well.

    }
}


","  Great, let's dive into this! You're on the right track by iterating over the buttons in the view and checking their index, but there are a few things you can do to improve the code and make it more efficient. Here are some suggestions:
1. Use a dictionary to store the currently selected button's index: Instead of keeping the selected button's index in a variable, consider using a dictionary to store the selected button's index along with its associated color. This will make it easier to access the correct color when the button is tapped.
For example, you can define a `selectedButtonIndices` dictionary in your `ContentView` struct like this:
import SwiftUI
struct ContentView: View {
    // ...

    @State var selectedButtonIndices: [Int] = []
    // ...

    var body: some View {
        // ...

        VStack {
            // ...

            ForEach(question.AnswerChoices.indices) {index in
                AnswerButton(text: question.AnswerChoices[index]) {
                    // Update the selected button index and color
                    let selectedButtonIndex = question.AnswerChoices[index].id
                    self.selectedButtonIndices.append(selectedButtonIndex)
                    if selectedButtonIndex == guessedIndex {
                        // Set the background color of the button to gray
                        self.selectChoice(at: index) <- .gray
                    } else {
                        // Set the background color of the button to clear
                        self.selectChoice(at: index) <- .clear
                    }
                }
            Spacer()
            // ...

            Button(""CHECK"") {
                // Toggle the selected button index and color
                for buttonIndex in selectedButtonIndices {
                    let button = answerButton(at: buttonIndex)
                    button.selectChoice(at: buttonIndex) <- self.selectChoice(at: buttonIndex)
                }
            }
            Button(""NEXT"") {
                // ...

            }
            }
        }
    }

2. Use a formal argument to pass the button index as a parameter to the `selectChoice` function: Instead of hardcoding the `selectChoice` function to take the index of the button being tapped, consider passing the index as a formal argument to the function. This will make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
For example, you can define the `selectChoice` function like this:

func selectChoice(at buttonIndex: Int) -> Color {
    // ...

    return .gray

}
Then, in your `AnswerButton` struct, you can use the `buttonIndex` parameter to call the `selectChoice` function:

struct AnswerButton: View {
    let text: String
    let onClick: () -&gt; Void

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            onClick()
        }) {
            Text(text)

        }
        .padding()
        .background(selectChoice(at: buttonIndex))
    }
3. Use a computed property to cache the selected button's color: Instead of recomputing the selected button's color every time the button is tapped, consider using a computed property to cache the color. This will make the code faster and more efficient.
For example, you can define a ` selectedButtonColor` computed property in your `ContentView` struct like this:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    @State var selectedButtonIndices: [Int] = []

    var body: some View {
        // ...

        VStack {
            // ...

            ForEach(question.AnswerChoices.indices) {index in
                AnswerButton(text: question.AnswerChoices[index]) {
                    // Update the selected button index and color
                    let selectedButtonIndex = question.AnswerChoices[index].id
                    self.selectedButtonIndices.append(selectedButtonIndex)
                    if selectedButtonIndex == guessedIndex {
                        // Set the background color of the button to gray
                        self.selectedButtonColor <- .gray
                    } else {
                        // Set the background color of the button to clear
                        self.selectedButtonColor <- .clear
                    }
                }
            Spacer()
            // ...

            Button(""CHECK"") {
                // Toggle the selected button index and color
                for buttonIndex in selectedButtonIndices {
                    let button = answerButton(at: buttonIndex)
                    button.selectChoice(at: buttonIndex) <- self.selectChoice(at: buttonIndex)
                }
            }
            Button(""NEXT"") {
                // ...

            }
            }
        }

        computed property var selectedButtonColor: Color {
            get {
                // Return the cached selected button color
                return self.selectedButtonIndices.first(where: { $0 != nil })?.selectChoice(at: $0)

            set {
                // Update the selected button color
                if newValue != nil {
                    let selectedButtonIndex = question.AnswerChoices[newValue!.id].id
                    self.selectedButtonIndices.append(selectedButtonIndex)

                } else {
                    self.selectedButtonIndices.removeAll()

                }
            }
        }

73750333,"How to call onchange from python xml rpc, for Odoo 15?","Hello I want to update a MO product_qty field, but keep all the related records (picking/transfers)
synched.
If I write to the record the product_qty gets updated, but not the related record. When doing this manually it works as intended.
I have tried the following, with no success.
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', 'onchange', [1223,{'product_qty': 10}])

","The best thing to do here is more to check in the code what functions are called that have an @api.onchage with at least product_qty in it.
By quick looking in the model with _name = 'mrp.production', I can see 3 of them. Perhaps some other classes that '_inherit' from it can add some, to be verified.
So try this :
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_product_qty', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_raw', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_finished', [[1223]])

There is also the possibility (a bit more rare but exists) that another model has an onchange on its production_id.product_qty e.g.
Looking at relevant models with the Regex Search @api\.onchange.*'product_qty' in both Odoo and Enterprise (if used) can be a good idea ;)
Hope it helps !
","  To call an `onchange` method from Python XML-RPC for Odoo 15, you can use the `execute_kw` method provided by the `models` module.
Here is an example of how you can update the `product_qty` field of a `Production` object and all related records (pickings and transfers) using `onchange`:
```
def update_product_qty(uid, password, production_id, product_qty):
    # prepare the execute_kw call
   db = connect_to('mrp')
    update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'mrp.production', 'onchange', [production_id, {'product_qty': product_qty}])
    # execute the onchange method
    res = update.do()

    # check if the method was successful
    if res.decode('utf-8')['result']:
        # update the production object
        db.save(production_id)
        # update the pickings and transfers
        pickings = models.get(db, uid, password, 'stock.picking', {'product_id': production_id})
        transfers = models.get(db, uid, password, 'stock.transfer', {'product_id': production_id})
        for picking in pickings:
            picking.write({'product_qty': product_qty})
        for transfer in transfers:
            transfer.write({'product_qty': product_qty})

    else:
        # raise an error if the method failed
        raise Error('Error updating production object and related records')

```
In the above example, `update_product_qty` is a function that takes four arguments: `uid`, `password`, `production_id`, and `product_qty`. It updates the `product_qty` field of the `Production` object with the given `id`, and all related records (pickings and transfers) that have the same `product_id`.
The function uses the `execute_kw` method to call the `onchange` method of the `Production` object with the given `id`. The method takes two arguments: `production_id` and `dependency`, which is a dictionary with the field values to update.
If the `onchange` method is successful, the method updates the `Production` object and all related records. If the method fails, an error is raised.
Note that in Odoo 15, the `onchange` method is now called `after_save` by default. So, you may want to check the Odoo documentation for the latest information on how to call `onchange` or `after_save` methods in Python XML-RPC.",0.7033662796020508,"python, odoo",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Created on 2022-11-16 with reprex v2.0.2
","Yes, there is a more dplyr-idiomatic way to achieve the desired result. Instead of manually filtering and merging the results, you can use the `pivot_wider()` function from the tidyr package to reshape the data.

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result using dplyr and tidyr:

```R
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

set.seed(123)
test_data <- data.frame(sample = sample(LETTERS[1:10], 100, replace = TRUE),
                        type = sample(letters[1:2], 100, replace = TRUE),
                        area = sample(1:100, replace = TRUE))

res_sum <- test_data %>%
  group_by(sample, type) %>%
  summarise(area = sum(area)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = area, names_prefix = ""area."")

head(res_sum)
```

This will give you the following output:

```
# A tibble: 10 x 3
# Groups:   sample [10]
   sample area.a area.b
   <chr>   <int>  <int>
 1 A         244    147
 2 B          17    152
 3 C         153    541
 4 D         107     94
 5 E         246    266
 6 F         189    286
 7 G         167    192
 8 H         201    254
 9 I         177    137
10 J         201    150
```

In this approach, `pivot_wider()` is used to convert the long format to wide format, with separate columns for each type. The `names_prefix` argument is used to add the ""area."" prefix to the column names.

There are challenges I'm facing and didn't get to solve right now:

If there is no corresponding timeframe-match it should show null in the corresponding row
It can happen both ways that there are two or more timeframes that can fall into the timeframe of the other table and vice versa.
It occurs, that different ID's appear in table two, related to one firstID

I already tried to join the two tables with some conditions but never got the result I needed.
Here's my query:

       attribute,

            ELSE cast(s.valid_from as date)
       END AS valid_from
FROM first f
LEFT JOIN second AS s ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID
                     AND s.valid_from &lt;= f.valid_until

Here's my current output:

Here's the DDL to generate and populate the tables:

","You should enclose both dates from the table &quot;second&quot; inside dates from the table &quot;first&quot; and you should get your output:
SELECT f.firstid,
       s.secondid,
       attribute,
       attribute2,
       CASE WHEN f.valid_from &gt;= COALESCE(s.valid_from, -1) 
            THEN CAST(f.valid_from AS DATE)
            ELSE CAST(s.valid_from AS DATE)
       END AS valid_from
FROM      first  f
LEFT JOIN second s 
       ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID
      AND s.valid_from &gt;= f.valid_from
      AND s.valid_until &lt;= f.valid_until

Check the demo here.
Note: in case your output should get you way more rows than the ones given here, one option is to do a cartesian product and filter out the rows you don't need.
","  To fix the problem, you can use a subquery to join the two tables based on the matching timeframes, and then use the `COALESCE` function to handle the cases where there is no matching timeframe in the other table. Here's an example query that should give you the desired output:
SELECT f.firstid,
       s.secondid,
       COALESCE(MAX(f.attribute), 'null') AS attribute,
       COALESCE(MAX(f.attribute2), 'null') AS attribute2
FROM first f
LEFT JOIN second AS s ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID
WHERE f.valid_from <= s.valid_from AND f.valid_until >= s.valid_from
GROUP BY f.firstid, s.secondid
ORDER BY f.valid_from, s.valid_from;

The subquery in the `COALESCE` function is used to find the maximum value in the `attribute` and `attribute2` columns of the `first` table for each matching `firstid` and `secondid`, and then the `COALESCE` function returns the maximum value or 'null' if there is no matching value in the other table.
Here are the explanations of the query:
* `SELECT f.firstid, s.secondid, COALESCE(MAX(f.attribute), 'null') AS attribute, COALESCE(MAX(f.attribute2), 'null') AS attribute2`: These are the columns we want to select from the result set. We're selecting the `firstid` and `secondid` columns from the `first` and `second` tables, respectively, and the `attribute` and `attribute2` columns from the `first` table. We're also using the `COALESCE` function to handle the cases where there is no matching value in the other table.
* `FROM first f LEFT JOIN second AS s ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID`: This is the join clause, which joins the `first` and `second` tables based on the `firstid` column in the `first` table and the `sk_firstID` column in the `second` table.
* `WHERE f.valid_from <= s.valid_from AND f.valid_until >= s.valid_from`: This filter clause filters the result set to only include rows where the `valid_from` column in the `first` table is less than or equal to the `valid_from` column in the `second` table, and the `valid_until` column in the `first` table is greater than or equal to the `valid_from` column in the `second` table.
* `GROUP BY f.firstid, s.secondid`: This group by clause groups the result set by the `firstid` and `secondid` columns.
* `ORDER BY f.valid_from, s.valid_from`: This order by clause orders the result set by the `valid_from` column in the `first` table and the `valid_from` column in the `second` table.

&gt;&gt;&gt; from selenium import webdriver
&gt;&gt;&gt; driver = webdriver.Firefox()
&gt;&gt;&gt; driver.get(u)
&gt;&gt;&gt; driver.page_source
'&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width; height=device-height;&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;resource://content-accessible/ImageDocument.css&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;resource://content-accessible/TopLevelImageDocument.css&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;(PNG Image, 256&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;256 pixels)&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&amp;amp;d=identicon&amp;amp;r=PG&amp;amp;f=1&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&amp;amp;d=identicon&amp;amp;r=PG&amp;amp;f=1&quot; class=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

Note that the url in the variable u is my avatar image, a binary image. However when looking at the page_source we see HTML created by firefox (not stackoverflow) used to display the image in the browser.
Questions:
How can I get the raw image content and how can I know if I should retrieve page_source or the raw image content?
Note: The Chrome driver has similar results.
","Selenium is not built for such tasks and does not have native support for extraction of details about raw content or communication such as HTTP headers. Selenium is a method to automate browser tasks that humans would do, and humans seldom look at such details.
There are however two main ways to try to solve this issue.

By forcing the browser used in selenium to go through a HTTP proxy, allowing the proxy to capture details about the protocol &amp; raw content, while still giving access to the browser handling of dynamic content. The most prominent seems to be selenium-wire: https://pypi.org/project/selenium-wire/
By using javascript execution feature in selenium, this way we can get much more details - but are limited to what the javascript engine has access to.

","  The issue you're facing is related to the way Selenium interacts with the browser and how it handles images. When you use `driver.page_source`, Selenium retrieves the entire HTML content of the page, including any images. However, when you try to retrieve the image content directly using `driver.get_image()`, it returns the HTML content of the image tag, not the raw image data.
To retrieve the raw image content, you can use the `By.cssSelector` method to select the image element and then use the `get_attribute()` method to retrieve the image data. Here's an example:
```python
import selenium
u = 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG&amp;f=1'
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get(u)
image_element = driver.find_element_by_css_ selector('img')
image_data = image_element.get_attribute('src')

with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(image_data)

driver.quit()

```
This code retrieves the image element using `find_element_by_css_selector()` and then uses the `get_attribute()` method to retrieve the `src` attribute of the image element. The image data is then written to a file named `image.jpg`.
Alternatively, you can use the `By.xpath()` method to select the image element and then use the `get_attribute()` method to retrieve the image data. Here's an example:

import selenium

u = 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG&amp;f=1'
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get(u)
image_element = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//img')
image_data = image_element.get_attribute('src')

with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(image_data)

driver.quit()

```
This code selects the image element using `find_element_by_xpath()` and then uses the `get_attribute()` method to retrieve the `src` attribute of the image element. The image data is then written to a file named `image.jpg`.
In general, you should use the `By.cssSelector` method to select the image element if you're sure that the image element has a unique `css_selector` value. However, if the image element's `css_selector` value is not unique, you may need to use the `By.xpath` method to select the image element.
As for why the Chrome driver has similar results, it's possible that the Chrome driver is also retrieving the HTML content of the image tag, rather than the raw image data. However, I haven't tested this specific scenario with the Chrome driver, so I can't say for sure.",0.511674702167511,"python, selenium",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Formatting your code will help immensely to start debugging this. I've reformatted your current HTML with some indenting and line breaks to help make it clear:

            &lt;input type=&quot;reset&quot; value=&quot;Clear&quot;&gt;

There are a few things wrong with this:

Opening &lt;p&gt; with no &lt;/p&gt; (closing tag) anywhere
&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt; nested inside of an existing form isn't allowed and will cause submission issues (see &quot;Permitted content&quot; at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
The closing &lt;/form&gt; that exists matches the &lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;, but you're missing a &lt;/form&gt;
You don't have a message field anywhere

Here's the updated HTML with my suggested fixes:

&lt;/form&gt;

As others have mentioned, it's not clear what the 500 error is, so that will need to be resolved before this will work. But here's a cleaned up version of the PHP. This has been simply tested at https://3v4l.org/WePRh, though it won't show the form or any input values, but it does prove that the script runs. This is formatted better, includes all form inputs, and should make things easier to work with:
&lt;?php
    // get all form values
    $input['Contact name'] = $_POST['contact_name'] ?? '';
    $input['Firm name'] = $_POST['firm_name'] ?? '';
    $input['Email'] = $_POST['email'] ?? '';
    $input['Job number'] = $_POST['job_number'] ?? '';
    $input['Document'] = $_POST['document'] ?? '';
    $input['Discount'] = $_POST['discount'] ?? '';
    $input['Message'] = $_POST['message'] ?? '';

    // generate the email content (i.e. each line is like &quot;Contact name: Mark&quot;)
    $formContent = '';
    foreach($input as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $formContent .= $key . &quot;: &quot; . $value . &quot;\n&quot;;
    }

    $to = &quot;my@email.com&quot;; // TODO: replace this with your email address
    $subject = &quot;Contact Form&quot;;

        Note that this was likely causing downstream issues. Most email clients (gmail, outlook) will mark emails as spam
        if you try to send an email from an email address that your server isn't configured to send from.
        See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17533863/how-to-configure-php-to-send-e-mail for more info.
        It's also safer to define an email address like &quot;no-reply@example.com&quot; to send your emails from.
    */
    $mailheader = &quot;From: no-reply@example.com&quot;;

    mail($to, $subject, $formContent, $mailheader) or die('Error sending email');

    // redirect to the thank you page
    // TODO: update this URL to be yours
    header('Location: http://www.example.com/thankyou.html');

    exit;
?&gt;

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you fix the issue with your mail.php file and make the necessary changes to email all the data requested on your HTML form.
Here are the issues I noticed with your current code:
1. `$name = $_POST['name'];` - You are trying to access the `$_POST` array directly, but you need to use the `namespaced` notation to access the values in the array. So, instead of `$_POST['name']`, you should use `$_POST['name']` or `$_POST['contact_name']` (if that's the name of the field in your form).
2. `$email = $_POST['email'];` - Similarly, you need to use the namespaced notation to access the value of the `email` field in the form. So, it should be `$_POST['email']` or `$_POST['contact_email']`.
3. `$message = $_POST['message'];` - This line works correctly, as you are accessing the value of the `message` field directly.
4. `$formcontent = ""From: $name \n Message: $message"";` - This line is incorrect, as you are concatenating strings directly without any quotes around them. You should use double quotes around the string to prevent syntax errors. Here's the corrected line: `$formcontent = ""From: "" . $name . ""\n Message: "" . $message;`
5. `$recipient = ""MY EMAIL"";` - This line needs to be changed to the actual email address you want to send the message to.
6. `$subject = ""Contact Form"";` - This line is correct.
7. `$mailheader = ""From: "" . $email . ""\r\n"";` - This line needs to be corrected to use a single quote instead of a double quote around the email address. Here's the corrected line: `$mailheader = ""From: "" . $email . ""\r\n"";`
Now, let's fix the issues and create a working mail.php file. Here's an updated version of your mail.php file:
`<?php
// Get the form data
$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
$formcontent = ""From: "" . $name . ""\n Message: "" . $message;

// Set the recipient email address
$recipient = ""recipient@example.com"";

// Set the email subject
$subject = ""Contact Form"";

// Set the email headers
$mailheader = ""From: "" . $email . ""\r\n"";

// Send the email
mail($recipient, $subject, $formcontent, $mailheader);

// Redirect to a success page
echo ""Thank you for your message!"";
header(""Location: thankyou.html"");
?>
Note that I've added a new line `echo ""Thank you for your message!"";` to display a success message after the email is sent. I've also added a new line `header(""Location: thankyou.html"");` to redirect the user to a ""thank you"" page after the email is sent.
Here, I've assumed that your ""thankyou.html"" page is located in the same directory as your mail.php file. If that's not the case, you'll need to update the `header()` function to include the full path to the ""thankyou.html"" page.
Lastly, I've added a closing `?>` symbol at the end of the file, as you should always close your PHP tags at the end of the file to avoid syntax errors.",0.6648843884468079,"php, html, email",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

When a heavy task is launched, django stops responding and it becomes impossible for users to navigate between pages until the task is finished.
For me a solution would be to run these heavy tasks in the background or in parallel in order to allow the user to be able to navigate between the pages in the meantime. Do you know how I can do this ?
","celery is the typical way of doing this and has direct support for Django.
Here are the docs to get started with celery in Django:  https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html
","  Yes, I can help you with that! In Django, you can run background tasks using Celery, a popular task queueing system for Python. Celery allows you to write tasks in any language, including Python, and run them in the background, without blocking the Django application.
Here's how you can run heavy tasks in the background with Celery in Django:
1. Install Celery:
First, you need to install Celery using pip:
```
pip install celery
```
2. Create a Celery configuration file:

Create a new file in your project directory called `celery.conf.py` and add the following code:
```
CELATEST = app.celery_aping.Celery('appname')
BROKER_URL = 'amqp://user:password@localhost//queue'
CELERY_ALWAYS_GIVE_DEFAULT = True
CELERY_USE_AGENT = True
```
Replace `'appname'` with the name of your Django app, and `localhost` with the URL of your message broker.
3. Define your tasks:

Create a new file in your app directory called `tasks.py` and define your heavy tasks. For example:
```
from celery import shared_task
from django.utils import timezone
def process_image(image_path):
    # Do something with the image
    return True

@shared_task( binds=True )
def process_images(imgs):
    for image in imgs:
        process_image(image)
        # Wait for 10 seconds before processing the next image

```
In this example, the `process_image` task takes an image path as input and performs some heavy computing, such as image processing. The `process_images` task is a batch task that processes a list of images in parallel.
4. Run your tasks:

To run your tasks, use the `celery beat` tool:
```
celery beat -l appname -P

This will run your tasks in the background every 5 minutes. You can adjust the interval by changing the `-P` option.
5. Handle the results:

When your tasks are finished, you can handle the results using the `Task` object. For example:
```
from celery import task

def handle_image_result(task):
    # Do something with the result of the task
    return True

@task
def process_image(image_path):
    # Run the task in the background
    task = process_image.apply_async()
    # Get the result of the task
    result = task.get()
    # Handle the result
    handle_image_result(result)

```
In this example, the `handle_image_result` function is called when the `process_image` task finishes. It can handle the result of the task, such as saving it to a database or sending an email.
That's it! With these steps, you can run heavy tasks in the background in Django using Celery. This will improve the performance of your application and allow users to navigate between pages while the task is running.",0.6497892141342163,django,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Here are the docs to get started with celery in Django:  https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html
","To run heavy tasks in the background with Django and ensure that the application remains responsive, you can use a combination of Django's built-in features and external libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Install the required libraries:
   - `django-background-tasks`: This library allows you to define and schedule background tasks.
   - `celery`: This is a distributed task queue system that can be used to run tasks asynchronously.

2. Configure Celery:
   - Install Celery using `pip install celery`.
   - Create a `celery.py` file in your Django project's root directory.
   - Inside the `celery.py` file, configure Celery to use your Django settings.
   - Define the `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` settings in your Django settings file (`settings.py`). You can choose a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis and a result backend like Redis or a database.

3. Define the heavy task:
   - Create a new file, e.g., `tasks.py`, in one of your Django apps.
   - Import the required modules: `from background_task import background`.
   - Define a function that represents your heavy task and decorate it with `@background(schedule=10)`. This decorator specifies that the task should run in the background every 10 seconds. Adjust this value according to your needs.
   - Implement the logic for your heavy task within this function.

4. Schedule the task:
   - You can schedule the task to run immediately or at a specific time using the `schedule` parameter of the `@background` decorator.
   - To schedule the task, you can either call the task function directly or use Django's shell to schedule it.

5. Start the Celery worker:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Django project.
   - Run the command `celery -A project_name worker --loglevel=info`, replacing `project_name` with the name of your Django project.
   - This command starts the Celery worker, which will process the background tasks.

6. Run your Django application:
   - Start your Django application as you normally would, using `python manage.py runserver`.

With these steps in place, your heavy tasks will be executed in the background, and your Django application will remain responsive. Users will be able to navigate between pages while the tasks are being processed asynchronously by the Celery worker.

Note: Make sure to thoroughly test your implementation and handle any potential error scenarios or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the heavy tasks.",0.6569253206253052,django,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    new_list.append(temp_list)

","  Great, you're on the right track! You can definitely create a new list of lists using an explicit for loop. Here's one way to do it:
new_list = []
for x in values:
    temp_list = []
    for y in required:
        temp_list.append(x[y])
    new_list.append(temp_list)

This will create a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the elements that match the given requirement `required`.
Here's why your previous attempt didn't work:
 when you used `new_list.append(x[y])`, you were adding each element of `x` to a list `new_list`, regardless of whether it matched the requirement `required`. By using a separate list `temp_list` and appending it to `new_list`, we ensure that only the elements that match the requirement are included in the new list.
Note that the outer `for` loop is iterating over `values`, and the inner `for` loop is iterating over `required`. This means that each element of `values` is being checked against all elements of `required`, which is the desired behavior.

72843205,how to manage multiple 'executable and datadir profile' for parallelizing the launch of scrappers?,"I am using , and have difficulties to launch 4 scripts at the same time.
I have used theses variable for local browser
let CHROMIUM_DATA_DIR = `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir${this.cmd}`
let CHROMIUM_EXEC_PATH = `/Applications/Google-Chrome${this.cmd}.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`

I have multiplied by 4, the same datadir, et the same executable. I have just renamed the files/directories.
It does not work well. What would be your recomendation, to quickly scale the launch of the scrappers (). How could I install various chromes instance, et managing according datadir (to save some login session etc..)
tks

","Since you are using playwright, you can use persistent contexts.
You do not need to create your own data directories or executables by copying them, simply pass location of an empty directory when launching the browser and playwright will populate it itself, storing any session data.
I do not use node.js, but just to give an idea, sample code in python:
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir=r'C:\Users\me\Desktop\dir', headless=False)

    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto(&quot;http://playwright.dev&quot;)
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()

","  I completely understand your challenge of scaling the launch of multiple scrapers using different Chrome instances with distinct data directories. Here are some recommendations to help you achieve this:
1. Use the Chrome Command-Line Parameters:
Instead of hardcoding the executable path and data directory for each Chrome instance, consider using command-line parameters to pass these values. You can specify the data directory and other configuration parameters for each Chrome instance when launching the script.
For example, you can use the following command to launch four Chrome instances with distinct data directories:
`four_chromes = [""--datadir=/path/to/chromium-data-dir1"", ""--datadir=/path/to/chromium-data-dir2"", ""--datadir=/path/to/chromium-data-dir3"", ""--datadir=/path/to/chromium-data-dir4""]`
Here, `four_chromes` is a list of command-line parameters that contain the data directory for each Chrome instance. You can then use these parameters when launching each Chrome instance.
2. Use a Configuration File:
Instead of hardcoding the data directory and other configuration parameters for each Chrome instance, consider using a separate configuration file that defines these values. You can create a file like `chrome_config.json` with the following content:
{
""data_directories"": [
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir1"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir2"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir3"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir4""
]
}

 Then, in your script, you can read this configuration file and use the defined values when launching each Chrome instance.
3. Use a Multi-Instance Chrome Driver:
If you are using the `playwright` module to launch Chrome, you can use the `--multi-instance` option to launch multiple Chrome instances simultaneously. This option enables multiple instances of Chrome to run in separate processes, allowing you to manage each instance independently.
For example:
`playwright.chromium.launch({
 multiInstance: true,
dataDirectories: [
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir1"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir2"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir3"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir4""
]
})`

4. Use a Chrome Driver Manager:
Another approach is to use a Chrome driver manager like ` chrome-driver-manager` to manage multiple Chrome instances. This module provides a convenient way to launch and manage Chrome instances, allowing you to define different data directories for each instance.
For example:
`chromeDriverManager = new ChromeDriverManager({
dataDirectories: [
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir1"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir2"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir3"",
""/path/to/chromium-data-dir4""
]
})`

In summary, there are several ways to manage multiple Chrome instances with distinct data directories. By using command-line parameters, a configuration file, the `--multi-instance` option, or a Chrome driver manager, you can quickly scale the launch of your scrapers without sacrificing configuration control.",0.46186625957489014,"google-chrome, playwright, multiple-instances",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

list2env(setNames(lst2, paste0(&quot;DFF&quot;, names(lst2))), envir = globalenv())

","  The issue you're encountering is due to the default behavior of the `set_names()` function in R, which changes the names of columns in a dataframe to a sequential number starting from 1. In your case, the `imap()` function is applying `set_names()` to each dataframe in the list, which results in the column names being changed to numerical values.
To prevent this behavior and keep the original column names, you can provide the `set_names()` function with a vector of names that you want to use for the columns, instead of relying on the default behavior. Here's an updated code snippet that demonstrates how to extract dataframes from the list and keep the original column names:
```
ap(lst2, ~ set_names(tibble(.x), .y)) %&gt;% 
        set_names(str_c(""Original Column Names"", seq_along(.))) %&gt;% 
        list2env(.GlobalEnv)
```
In this code, we're passing the `str_c()` function a vector of the original column names, followed by the sequential numbers using `seq_along()` function. This tells `set_names()` to use the specified names for the columns, instead of the default behavior of assigning numerical names.
Alternatively, you can also use the `tibble()` function with the `names` argument set to a vector of the original column names, like this:
```

ap(lst2, ~ tibble(.x, names = c(""Column1"", ""Column2"", ..., ""Column6694""))) %&gt;% 
        list2env(.GlobalEnv)
```

In this example, the `dropna` function is called with the `inplace=True` parameter to indicate that the values should be dropped in place, rather than returning a new DataFrame. The `axis=1` parameter specifies that the operation should be performed on the values in each row, rather than the index. The `how='any'` parameter indicates that only the values that appear in any of the specified columns should be dropped. Finally, the `skipna=False` parameter ensures that the NaT (Not a Number) values are also dropped.

The resulting DataFrame will have the desired structure:

74363179,Make a view generic and usable with TYPE as well as Binding<TYPE>,"I just had a situation where I wanted to use a view which, takes a String, with a Binding:

        Button{

            }

I couldn't get it to work in an acceptable time period, so I just created a second view:
struct MyBoundedButton: View {
    
    @Binding var text: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Button{
            HStack {

    }
}

This obviously works, but doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution. I tried to figure out how the SwiftUI framework does it, since there are plenty of examples of views which have very different initialisers (see the SwiftUI Button for instance). I still want to figure out how this might work, so since after work I'm trying to play around with generic view, but can't really get it to work. The following code doesn't work and is just to demonstrate the line of thinking I'm following:
struct MyButton&lt;T&gt;: View {
        
        var text: T
        
        var body: some View {

    init(text: Binding&lt;String&gt;)

extension MyButton where text == String{
    init(text: String)

Does someone have an idea how this could be implemented or how Apple does this in their SwiftUI library?

","This could be done different ways... your approach with generics seems more elegant, but I believed that you are seeking a more understandable code, simpler:
import SwiftUI

struct MyButton: View {
    
    private var text: Binding&lt;String&gt;?
    private var pureText: String?
    private var action: () -&gt; Void
    
    init(text: Binding&lt;String&gt;, action: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {
        self.action = action
        self.text = text
    }
    
    init(text: String, action: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {
        self.action = action
        self.pureText = text
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: action) {
            if let text = text {
                Text(text.wrappedValue)
            }
            if let text = pureText {
                Text(text)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var text = &quot;Press me&quot;
    
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: &quot;globe&quot;)
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundColor(.accentColor)
            Text(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
            
            MyButton(text: $text) {
                print(&quot;Button pressed.&quot;)
            }
        }
    }
}

Although the binding in this case doesn't make much sense... binding is when you are changing the value of the variable and want to pass UP to the ParentView, a binding inside a Text(text) that will never change doesn't make sense to me, but this is how you done with multiple initializers.
","  Yes, I can help you with that! The problem you're facing is that you can't use a `Binding` to a generic type parameter in a generic view in SwiftUI. The reason for this is that `Binding` is a protocol, and protocols cannot be used as type parameters in generic types.
However, there are several ways to work around this limitation:
1. Use a generic view with a non-generic initialiser: You can define a non-generic view that takes a `String` parameter and use it as a generic view with a type parameter. Here's an example:
struct MyButton<T>: View {
        var text: T
        
        var body: some View {
            Button{
                HStack {
                    Text(text)
                }   
            }
        }
        init(text: String) {
            self.text = text
        }
    }

Then, you can use this view with a `Binding` to a `String` parameter like this:
struct MyScene: View {
        @State private var text: String = """"
        var body: some View {
            MyButton(text: $text)
        }
    }
2. Use a generic view with a generic initialiser: You can define a generic view that takes a `T` parameter and uses a generic initialiser to create the view. Here's an example:
struct MyButtonGeneric<T>: View {

        var text: T
        
        var body: some View {
            Button{
                HStack {
                    Text(text)
                }   
            }
        }
        init<T>(text: T) where T: View, T.Texture == View {
            self.text = text
        }
    }

Then, you can use this view with a `Binding` to a `String` parameter like this:
struct MyScene: View {
        @State private var text: String = """"
        var body: some View {
            MyButtonGeneric(text: $text)
        }
    }
3. Use a protocol-oriented approach: You can define a protocol that includes a `Text` property and use it as a generic type parameter in your view. Here's an example:
protocol MyProtocol {
    var text: String { get set }
}
struct MyButton<T: MyProtocol>: View {

        var body: some View {
            Button{
                HStack {
                    Text(text)
                }   
            }
        }

Then, you can use this view with a `Binding` to a `String` parameter like this:
struct MyScene: View {
        @State private var text: String = """"
        var body: some View {
            MyButton(text: $text)
        }
    }
4. Use a computed property: You can define a computed property that returns a `Text` view with the `text` property and use it as a generic type parameter in your view. Here's an example:
struct MyButton<T>: View {

        var body: some View {
            Button{
                HStack {
                    Text(text)
                }   
            }
            init() {
                self.text = self.myComputedProperty.text

        }

        private var myComputedProperty: SomeView {
            Text(""Initialised computed property!"")
        }
    }

Then, you can use this view with a `Binding` to a `String` parameter like this:
struct MyScene: View {
        @State private var text: String = """"

        var body: some View {
            MyButton(text: $text)
        }
    }
These are just a few examples of how you can work around the limitation of using a `Binding` to a generic type parameter in a generic view in SwiftUI.

","  To create a new model with a one-to-one relationship to an existing model in Django, you can use the `OneToOneField` field in the new model. This field will automatically create a table relationship between the new and old models.
Since you already have users in the database, you will need to perform a migration to create the new table for the Profile model, while also setting up the default relationships between the Profile and User models.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:
1. Create a new migration file by running `makemigrations` in the terminal. This will create a new file called `0002_profile.py`.
2. In the migration file, add the following code to create the Profile model:
```python
from django.db import models
class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    avatar = models.ImageField(default=&quot;gravatar.jpg&quot;, upload_to=&quot;avatars/&quot;)

        ),
    ]

    def migration_name(self):
        return 'profile'

```
This code creates a new Profile model with a one-to-one relationship to the User model. The `user` field is set to `OneToOneField` with `on_delete=models.CASCADE`, which means that when a User instance is deleted, the associated Profile instance will also be deleted.
3.Now you need to run the migration to create the new table for the Profile model:


```
python manage.py migrate


```

This will create the new table for the Profile model and set up the default relationships between the Profile and User models.
4. Finally, you can add the Profile model to your Django app's `models.py` file:


```python
from .models import Profile


# Register your models with their corresponding app
from django.conf import settings


def register(model_name):
    models = {
        model_name: __import__(model_name, from_ django.conf import settings, app_label)

    }

register(Profile)


```
This will register the Profile model with your Django app and make it available for usage in your app.

That's it! You have now created a new model with a one-to-one relationship to an existing model in Django. When you add the Profile model to your app, Django will automatically create the table and set up the default relationships for you.",0.6525722742080688,"django, django-models, database-migration",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    ]


More about custom scripts in migrations here
","To fix the problem and create a new model with a one-to-one relationship with the existing User model, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new migration file for the Profile model using the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. Open the newly created migration file (it should be located in the ""migrations"" directory of your app) and find the `operations` list. Add a new operation to create a Profile instance for each existing User. You can use the `RunPython` operation to run a custom Python function during the migration. Here's an example of how the migration file might look:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   def create_profiles(apps, schema_editor):
       User = apps.get_model('your_app_name', 'User')
       Profile = apps.get_model('your_app_name', 'Profile')
       for user in User.objects.all():
           Profile.objects.create(user=user)

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ('your_app_name', 'previous_migration_file'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunPython(create_profiles),
       ]
   ```

   Make sure to replace `'your_app_name'` with the actual name of your app and `'previous_migration_file'` with the name of the previous migration file.

3. Apply the migration to the database using the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   This will create the Profile model and associate it with the existing User instances.

After performing these steps, each existing User should have an associated Profile with them.",0.8341127634048462,"django, django-models, database-migration",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73093527,Find index in array based on given value,"I have a sorted array of numbers with array length as n. For a given item k find index i in the sorted array where elements from index i to n are greater than the given item k. If there is no index present then return -1
This is my program:
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
     int x = -1;
     for(int i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++) {
       if(arr[i] &gt; k) {
           x = i; break;
       }
     }
     return x;
}

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), and I want to reduce it further.
","Since the array is sorted, use binary search for a time complexity of O(log N).
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low &lt;= high) {
        int mid = low + high &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
        if(arr[mid] &gt; k) high = mid - 1;
        else low = mid + 1;
    }
    return low == arr.length ? -1 : low;
}

","  Your approach of searching the index of a given value in a sorted array using a for loop is a good one, but it has a time complexity of O(n), which can be slow for large arrays. Here are a few ways to improve the performance:
1. Use a linear search instead of a for loop:
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > k) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) as well, but it can be faster than the original approach for large arrays because it avoids unnecessary iterations.
2. Use a divide and conquer approach:
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] > k) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return right;
}

This approach has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much faster than the original approach for large arrays.
3. Use a binary search:
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == k) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < k {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

This approach has a time complexity of O(log n), which is the fastest of the three approaches for large arrays.

In summary, the best approach depends on the size of the array and the value of k. For small arrays, the linear search may be the fastest. For large arrays, the divide and conquer approach or the binary search may be faster.",0.828361988067627,"java, arrays, algorithm",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74027109,"How to create a dictionary with two querysets from different models, using a common DateTimeField as the dictionary keys?","I would like to create a dictionary from two models with a field dt in common. This field should be the dictionary keys, and fields value and last the keys's value. What is the most efficient way to do that ?

    value = models.FloatField(default=0)
    dt = models.DateTimeField()

class Price(models.Model):
    last = models.FloatField(default=0)
    dt = models.DateTimeField()

The desired output would be something like this :
{
    &quot;2022-10-11T00:00:00Z&quot;: {
        &quot;value&quot;: 151.05,

    }
}

I could iterate through each dictionaries of the querysets with a nested loop and search the items with a common dt then populate key:value inside a new dictionary, but it's not elegant and I don't believe it's efficient.
","This will do but not so sure about efficiency.
import datetime
balances = Balance.objects.annotate(date_only=Cast('dt',DateField())).values(&quot;date_only&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)
prices = Price.objects.annotate(date_only=Cast('dt',DateField())).values(&quot;date_only&quot;, &quot;last&quot;)

        data[str_date]['last'] = price['last']
        data[str_date]['value'] = balance['value']


print(data)

","  To create a dictionary with two querysets from different models, using a common DateTimeField as the dictionary keys, you can use the `annotate` method of Django's queryset class to perform the calculation and Then use the ` dictionary` method to create the dictionary with the desired format.
Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
from django.db.models import QuerySet, DateTimeField
# Define the two querysets
balance_qs = Price.objects.all().annotate(dt=DateTimeField(expression='DT_SUB(timestamp(), TIMEZONE_FORMAT(timestamp(),TIMEZONE_NAME))'))
balance_dict = {}
for b in balance_qs:
    balance_dict[b.dt] = {
        'value': b.value,
        'last': b.last,
    }

prices_qs = Balance.objects.all().annotate(dt=DateTimeField(expression='DT_SUB(timestamp(), TIMEZONE_FORMAT(timestamp(),TIMEZONE_NAME))'))
prices_dict = {}
for p in prices_qs:
    prices_dict[p.dt] = {
        'value': p.value,
        'last': p.last,
    }

# Create the final dictionary with the merging of the two dictionaries
result = {}
for dt, balance_data in balance_dict.items():
    if dt in prices_dict:
        result[dt] = {**balance_data, **prices_dict[dt]}
    else:
        result[dt] = balance_data

print(result)
```
This will give you the desired output in the structure you described:
```
{
    ""2022-10-11T00:00:00Z"": {
        ""value"": 151.05,
        ""last"": 1,
    },
    ""2022-10-10T00:00:00Z"": {
        ""value"": 151.1,
        ""last"": 1.1,
    },
    ""2022-10-09T00:00:00Z"": {
        ""value"": 152,
        ""last"": 1.1,
    },
    ""2022-10-08T00:00:00Z"": {
        ""value"": 154,
        ""last"": 1.23,
    },
}


```
In this example, the `annotate` method is used to perform the calculation of the dt field for both models, and then the ` dictionary` method is used to create the dictionary with the desired format. The `for` loop iterates through the querysets and for each dt key, it checks if the key exists in the other dictionary, if not it adds it, if it does it merge the two dictionaries.
This way you can avoid the nested loop and make the code more efficient.
Note that in the above example, I've assumed that the dt field in both models is of the same type(date time) and has the same format(ISO8601). If that's not the case, you might need to adjust the `annotate` method accordingly.",0.6875345706939697,"python, django, django-models",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

pip install selenium --user

","  The error message ""Access is denied"" typically occurs when the system is trying to install a package or modify a file that belongs to another user or a system partition. In your case, the error is happening while installing Selenium using `pip`.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following approaches:
1. Use the `--user` option with `pip`:
You can try installing Selenium using the `--user` option with `pip`. This option installs the package in the user's home directory instead of system-wide. Here's an example command:
```
! pip install selenium --user
```
This should bypass the permission issues and install the package in the user's home directory.
2. Grant permission to the Python executable:
Another approach is to grant permission to the Python executable to write to the specified directory. You can do this by right-clicking on the Python executable and selecting ""Properties"". Then, go to the ""Advanced"" tab and check the box that says ""Allow this program to act as a user.""
After doing this, try installing Selenium again using `pip`.
3. Update the Certifi package:
It's possible that the Certifi package is causing the issue. You can try updating the Certifi package to the latest version using the following command:

! pip install --upgrade certifi

After updating Certifi, try installing Selenium again using `pip`.
4. Run Python as an administrator:
Another approach is to run Python as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on the Python executable and selecting ""Run as administrator."" Then, type the installation command and press Enter.
After running Python as an administrator, try installing Selenium again using `pip`.

","There are multiple problems.
The first problem is that when you are writing the output file, you need to set it to binary for the same reason you need to do so when reading the input.
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);

The second problem is that when you are reading the input file, you are only reading the bytes of the input stream and treat them like a string. However, those bytes do not have a terminating null character. If you call MultiByteToWideChar with a -1 length, it infers the input string length from the terminating null character, which is missing in your case. That means both utf16size and the contents of  pUTF16 are already wrong. Add it manually after reading the file:
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

The last problem is that you are using CP_ACP. That means &quot;the current code page&quot;. In your question, you were specifically asking how to convert Shift-JIS. The code page Windows uses for its closes equivalent to what is commonly called &quot;Shift-JIS&quot; is 932 (you can look that up on wikipedia for example). So use 932 instead of CP_ACP:
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

Additionally, there is no reason to create wstring str(pUTF16). Just use pUTF16 directly in the WideCharToMultiByte calls.
Also, I'm not sure how kosher char *ptr = &amp;result[0] is. I personally would not create a string specifically as a buffer for this.
Here is the corrected code. I would personally not write it this way, but I don't want to impose my coding ideology on you, so I made only the changes necessary to fix it:
// From file
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(&quot;rb&quot;));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

// convert multibyte to  wide char
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

// convert wide char to multi byte utf-8 before writing to a file
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
string result;
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0));
char *ptr = &amp;result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File &lt;&lt; ptr;

File.close();

Also, you have a memory leak -- lpszBuf and pUTF16 are not cleaned up.
","  The issue you are facing is that the `WideCharToMultiByte` function is not correctly converting the wide-character string to multi-byte encoding. The reason is that the `CP_UTF8` character encoding is not the correct one for converting wide characters to UTF-8.
The `CP_UTF8` character encoding is used for converting wide characters to Unicode code points in the range of U+0000 to U+00FF. However, when you try to convert a wide character string to UTF-8, you need to use the `CP_ACP` character encoding, which is the default encoding for Unicode characters in the range of U+0000 to U+10FFFF.
Here's an updated version of your code that fixes the issue:
```c++
// From file
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(""rb""));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);

// convert multibyte to wide char
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

wstring str(pUTF16);

// convert wide char to multi byte UTF-8 before writing to a file
string result = WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0);

// write the result to a file
ofstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out);
File << result;

File.close();
```
In this updated code, we've changed the `CP_UTF8` character encoding to `CP_ACP` for the `MultiByteToWideChar` function, as I mentioned earlier. We've also changed the `WideCharToMultiByte` function to use the `CP_UTF8` character encoding, which is the correct one for converting wide characters to multi-byte encoding in UTF-8.

1 | 1           == 1             - | is applied last

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand how to fix the problem with the bitwise operators in Python!
Let's break down the expression `print(1 | 0 ^ 1 &amp; ~0)`:
1. `1 | 0`: The bitwise OR operator `|` takes two bits as input and returns the highest bit set (i.e., the leftmost bit that is 1). In this case, `1` has the highest bit set, so the output is 1.
2. `0 ^ 1`: The bitwise XOR operator `^` takes two bits as input and returns the difference between the two bits. In this case, `0` is the difference between `1` and `0`, so the output is 0.
3. `1 &amp; ~0`: The bitwise AND operator `&` takes two bits as input and returns the lowest bit that is 1 (i.e., the leftmost bit that is set). In this case, `1` is the lowest bit that is set, so the output is 1.
4. `~0`: The bitwise NOT operator `~` takes a single bit as input and returns the opposite value (i.e., 0 if the input is 1, and 1 if the input is 0). In this case, `0` is the input, so the output is 1.
So, putting it all together, the expression `print(1 | 0 ^ 1 &amp; ~0)` evaluates to 1.
Now, let's talk about the bitwise operators you mentioned:
* `ball`: Ball is not a recognized term in Python.
* `carrot`: Carrot is not a recognized term in Python.
* `ampersand`: The ampersand operator `&` is used in Python to concatenate strings or to combine two values into a single variable. For example, `x = ""hello "" & y` would concatenate the string ""hello "" with the value of the variable `y`.
* `tilde`: The tilde operator `~` is used in Python to get the inverse of a binary number. For example, `x = ~0` would give you the inverse of the binary number 0, which is -1.

","To understand the step-by-step explanation of the given code, let's break it down:

1. The expression `1 | 0 ^ 1 & ~0` is evaluated from left to right based on operator precedence.

2. The bitwise operator `&` has higher precedence than `^` and `|`, so we start by evaluating `1 & ~0`.

3. The `~` operator is the tilde operator, which performs a bitwise negation. It flips all the bits of the operand. In this case, `~0` flips all the bits of 0, resulting in -1 in two's complement representation.

4. The bitwise operator `&` performs a bitwise AND operation. It compares the corresponding bits of the two operands and returns 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0. In this case, `1 & ~0` compares the bits of 1 and -1, resulting in a value of 1.

5. Now we have `1 | 0 ^ 1`, which is evaluated next.

6. The bitwise operator `^` performs a bitwise XOR operation. It compares the corresponding bits of the two operands and returns 1 if the bits are different; otherwise, it returns 0. In this case, `0 ^ 1` compares the bits of 0 and 1, resulting in a value of 1.

7. Finally, the bitwise operator `|` performs a bitwise OR operation. It compares the corresponding bits of the two operands and returns 1 if at least one of the bits is 1; otherwise, it returns 0. In this case, `1 | 1` compares the bits of 1 and 1, resulting in a value of 1.

8. The overall expression `1 | 0 ^ 1 & ~0` evaluates to 1.

          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

If you use the `ngIf` directive to conditionally load the image, you can attach the `ngIf` directive to the `image` element, like this:
&lt;img *ngIf=&quot;loadImage&quot;&gt;

Then, you can define a function `loadImage()` that checks whether the image has finished loading before displaying it:


function loadImage() {
   return this.image.src === 'https://example.com/Mor.png';

}
You can call the `loadImage()` function in the `setTimeout()` callback, like this:




setTimeout(() => {

  this.loadImage();


}, 1500);

}

This way, the image will only be displayed if it has finished loading, otherwise it will be hidden until it finishes loading.
You can also use the `async` pipe to wait for the image to load before displaying it, like this:






image = 'https://example.com/Mor.png';




If you use the `async` pipe, you don't need to define a separate `loadImage()` function, you can simply use the `async` pipe to wait for the image to load before displaying it.

    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}

The user provides the name of the property to filter by and the query string. What I had in mind is that I needed to allow the users to query Tickets by a computed property in Tickets, such as
public Employee LatestEmployee
{
    get =&gt; History.MaxBy(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).Employee;
}

I was suggested to leave the Entity models strictly to reflect the db structure and use a separate class to represent queryable properties of the entity:
public class TicketSummary
{
    public int TicketId {get;set;}
    public Employee LatestEmployee {get;set;}
}

            TicketId = t.Id,
            LatestEmployee = t.History.MaxBy(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).Employee
        });
}

And then call BuildSummaryQuery().Where(x=&gt;x.LatestEmployee.Name == &quot;Batman&quot;). However, I found out MaxBy() could not be translated into a valid query on the MySQL Database. I keep getting a The LINQ expression could not be translated. How can I work out a similar, valid query?
","As per StriplingWarrior's comment (What is the correct way to use computed properties with Dynamic LINQ?), instead of using MaxBy(), I successfully managed to create a valid query using OrderByDescending() and FirstOrDefault()
First, instead of computed properties on the entity, the actual queryable entity is
public class TicketSummary
{
    public string TicketId { get; set; }
    public History? LatestHistory { get; set; }
}

Then, the query is composed as follows
//Includes the tables needed for the filterable properties.
var firstQuery = _context.Tickets.Include(t =&gt; t.Histories).ThenInclude(h =&gt; h.Employee);

//Creates an IQueryable&lt;TicketSummary&gt; with the latest History entity
var ticketSummariesQueryable = firstQuery.Select(x =&gt; new TicketSummary
{
    TicketId = x.Id.ToString(),
    LatestHistory = x.Histories.OrderByDescending(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).FirstOrDefault()
});

//Finally apply the filters given by the user
var filteredQuery = ticketSummariesQueryable.Where(ts=&gt;ts.LatestHistory.Employee.Name == &quot;Black Canary&quot;);

This way the most recent History is stored on LatestHistory to be promptly used on queries.
","  The issue you're facing is that MySql does not support the `MaxBy()` extension method, which is used in the `LatestEmployee` property to retrieve the latest employee. MySql does not support the `OUTER APPLY` clause, which is used in the `MaxBy()` extension method to apply the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses to the subquery.
To achieve the same result in MySql, you can use a subquery to retrieve the latest employee and then join the subquery with the `Tickets` table. Here's an example of how you can modify the `BuildSummaryQuery()` method to make it work with MySql:
public IQueryable&lt;TicketSummary&gt; BuildSummaryQuery()
    return _context.Tickets.Select(t =&gt; new TicketSummary
        {
            TicketId = t.Id,
            LatestEmployee = (from h in t.Histories
                                    orderby h.Timestamp descending
                                    select h.Employee).FirstOrDefault();
        });

In this modified version of the method, we use a subquery to retrieve the latest employee from the `History` table. The subquery is `orderby h.Timestamp descending` to get the latest timestamp, and then `select h.Employee` to get the employee associated with the latest timestamp. Finally, we use `FirstOrDefault()` to retrieve the latest employee, or return `null` if no employee is found.
You can then use the `Where()` method to filter the results based on the name of the employee:
` var tickets = BuildSummaryQuery().Where(t => t.LatestEmployee.Name == ""Batman"");`
This should give you the same result as the original query, but with the added flexibility of being able to use subqueries to retrieve the latest employee in MySql.",0.6852684020996094,"c#, mysql, dynamic-linq, ef-core-6.0",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I was searching for similar problem and found that when you use make command you should not write make -j6 check but simply make , but this didn't help and using --with-external-capnp flag also didn't help. So the question is how to prevent running tests during the build.
","When cross-compiling, you need to first build and install Cap'n Proto on the host machine, so that the commands capnp and capnpc-c++ are available on the command line.
Once you've done that, you can cross-compile. Pass --with-external-capnp to ./configure when configuring cross-compiling, to tell it to use the installed copy of the tools rather than the self-built copy. Also make sure you make clean or build in a different directory so that the build doesn't accidentally try to use the host-built objects.
If this &quot;doesn't help&quot;, you'll need to provide more detail on what you're doing and what went wrong.
","  Thank you for providing more details about the issue you're experiencing with building capnproto on an ARM machine using an x64 compiler. Based on your description, it seems that the problem is related to the mismatch between the architecture of the machine running the build process and the architecture of the code being compiled.
To solve this issue, you have a few options:
1. Use a cross-compilation toolchain: You can use a cross-compilation toolchain like Crosstool-ng or Ninja to build the capnproto library for the ARM architecture using an x64 compiler. This way, the build process will be executed on an x64 machine, but the resulting code will be compiled for the ARM architecture.
Here's an example of how to use Crosstool-ng to build capnproto for the ARM architecture:
```
$ crosstool-ng --arch arm -mittle endian capnproto
```
This will build the capnproto project for the ARM architecture using the x64 compiler.
2. Use the `--with-external-capnp` flag: As you mentioned, using this flag did not help. However, you can try passing the `--with-external-capnp` flag along with the `--host` flag to specify the architecture of the machine running the build process.
For example:
```
$ make V=1 --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++ --with-external-capnp
```
This will tell the build process to compile the capnproto library for the ARM architecture using an x64 compiler, but to link it with the external capnp library for the ARM architecture.
3. Use a different compiler: If you cannot use a cross-compilation toolchain or the `--with-external-capnp` flag, you can try using a different compiler that is optimized for the ARM architecture. For example, you can use the arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++ compiler instead of the x64 clang++ compiler.
Here's an example of how to use the arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++ compiler to build capnproto:
```
$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++ -c -o capnproto.o capnproto.cpp
$ make V=1 arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++
```
This will build the capnproto project using the arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang++ compiler, which is optimized for the ARM architecture.

@Where(clause = &quot;deleted_at=null&quot;)
public class Example {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy= GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  Long id;
  String name;
  Timestamp deletedAt;
}

","For anyone looking into this in the future, the solution is to use
@Where(clause = &quot;deleted_at IS NULL&quot;)

","  It seems you are trying to use the `@Where` annotation to filter entities based on the `deleted_at` column, but you are facing issues when the `deleted_at` value is null.
The problem is that `NULL` is a valid value in a timestamp column, so Hibernate is interpreting your query as `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, which will exclude all entities where `deleted_at` is null.
To solve this issue, you can use the `IS NOT NULL` operator instead of `IS NULL`:
```diff idle-1002.java diff-1002.java diff-1002.java diff-1002.java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name=""examples"")
@NamedQuery(name=""Example.findAll"", query=""SELECT l FROM Example l"")
@SQLDelete(sql=""UPDATE examples SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() WHERE id = ?"")
@Where(clause = ""deleted_at IS NOT NULL"")
public class Example {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    Long id;
    String name;
    Timestamp deletedAt;
}
```
By using `IS NOT NULL` instead of `IS NULL`, Hibernate will filter entities where `deleted_at` is not null, which will include entities where `deleted_at` is null.
You can also use the `IN (` operator instead of `= NULL` to filter entities where `deleted_at` is null:
```diff idle-1002.java diff-1002.java diff-1002.java diff-1002.java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name=""examples"")
@NamedQuery(name=""Example.findAll"", query=""SELECT l FROM Example l"")
@SQLDelete(sql=""UPDATE examples SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() WHERE id = ?"")
@Where(clause = ""deleted_at IN (NULL)"")
public class Example {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    Long id;
    String name;
    Timestamp deletedAt;
}
```
This will include entities where `deleted_at` is null in the query result.

        bearerFormat = &quot;JWT&quot;,
        scheme = &quot;bearer&quot;
)

    }

And in the controller I have added like this.
@CrossOrigin(&quot;*&quot;)

Here after all these changes  still I can submit a post request without the Bearer token and get 200 Success response.
","In the controller :
@SecurityRequirement(name = &quot;bearerAuth&quot;) has to name the right requirement name :
try :
@SecurityRequirement(name = &quot;Bearer Authentication&quot;)
Regards
","  The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that you have not properly configured Spring Security to use the `bearer` token scheme in your Swagger configuration. Here are some possible solutions to fix the issue:
1. Change the `bearerFormat` property in your Swagger configuration to `JSON Web Token` (JWT):
```
@SecurityScheme(
    name = ""Bearer Authentication"",
    type = SecuritySchemeType.HTTP,
    bearerFormat = ""JWT"",
    scheme = ""bearer""
)
```
In this solution, the `bearerFormat` property is set to `JWT`, which tells Spring Security to expect a JWT token as the bearer token.
2. Add the `BearerToken` filter to your spring security configuration:
```
@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.oauth2Login()
            .userInfoEndpoint()
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(new BearerToken filter(), SecurityFilter.class);
    }

```
In this solution, the `BearerToken` filter is added to the Spring Security configuration, which will validate the bearer token before allowing access to the protected resources.
3. Configure the `BearerToken` filter to expect the JWT token:
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.oauth2Login()
            .userInfoEndpoint()
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(new BearerToken filter(), SecurityFilter.class)
            .filter(new JwtTokenValidator());
    }

```
In this solution, the `JwtTokenValidator` filter is added to the `BearerToken` filter, which will validate the JWT token before allowing access to the protected resources.
4. Add the `BearerToken` producer to your spring security configuration:

```
@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.oauth2Login()
            .userInfoEndpoint()
            .and()
            .addProducer(new BearerTokenProducer());
    }

```
In this solution, the `BearerTokenProducer` is added to the Spring Security configuration, which will produce the bearer token for authentication.
By implementing any of these solutions, you should be able to fix the issue and receive a 401 Unauthorized response when attempting to submit a POST request without the bearer token.",0.6069797277450562,"spring-boot, jwt, swagger, swagger-ui, bearer-token",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Yes, you can use the `coalesce` function in Apache Spark to handle null values in the `MAX` aggregation. The `coalesce` function returns the first non-null value from a list of arguments, or null if all arguments are null.

In this example, the `coalesce` function is applied to the `MAX` aggregation result. If any of the values in the `col_name` column are null, the `coalesce` function will return null, rather than ignoring the null value.
Alternatively, you can also use the `na.max` function from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module, which returns the maximum non-null value from a sequence of values.
Here's an example:

","Yes, there is a way to aggregate using MAX without ignoring null values. You can use the `coalesce` function in combination with `max` to achieve this.

Here's how you can modify the code to include null values in the MAX calculation:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Create the dataframe
df = spark.createDataFrame([(None,), (1,), (2,)], ['col_name'])

# Calculate MAX, including null values
max_with_null = F.coalesce(F.max('col_name'), F.lit(None)).alias('col_name')

# Aggregate using MAX, including null values
df.agg(max_with_null).show()
```

This will give you the following output:

```
+--------+
|col_name|
+--------+
|    null|

What I am trying to say, Is that unless you iterate the process and fetch the POM files of the dependencies yourself, with a custom task, All you can use is gradle dependencies command to check the transitive dependencies used by your project or module.
UPDATE:
You can easily start a new gradle project by following these simple steps.

mkdir gradleExp
 cd gradleExp
gradle init  # 1.basic 1.groovy random name
update the empty build.gradle with the following

plugins {
    id 'java'
}
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation &quot;com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0&quot;
}


gradle dependencies # to list all
gradle dependencies --configuration compileClasspath  # reduce output to show only Compile classpath for source set 'main'

NOTE: missing either google() or mavenCentral() will show some failure in the result shown.
","  Sure! To get the dependency tree of a library using Gradle, you can use the `dependencies` block in your Gradle build file. Specifically, you can use the `--tree` option to get the dependency tree for a particular artifact.
Here's an example of how to retrieve the dependency tree of the `com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0` artifact using Gradle:
1. Open your Gradle build file in an editor.
2. Find the `dependencies` block in your build file, usually located at the top of the file.
3. Add the `--tree` option to the `dependencies` block, like so:
```
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies here
    // Add the --tree option to get the dependency tree for the Firebase Firestore library
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0' --tree
}
```
In this example, the `--tree` option is added to the `implementation` dependency, which indicates that we want to retrieve the dependency tree for the `com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0` artifact.
4. Save the Gradle build file and run `gradle dependencies` command in the terminal to generate the dependency tree for the `Firebase Firestore` library.
The output will show the dependency tree for the `com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0` artifact, including the direct dependencies and the transitive dependencies.
Here's an example of what the output might look like:
```

","I think you can access it via counterForm's elements and you need to set what kind of html element is counterForm
you can simply use it in this way :
const counterForm = document.getElementById(&quot;counter__form&quot;) as HTMLFormElement;
counterForm.elements[0];

","  Ah, I see the issue. The `event` object in TypeScript is of type `EventTarget`, which does not have a direct `[]` notation for accessing properties. Instead, you can use bracket notation `[]` to access properties of the `EventTarget` object.
So, in your code, you can change `event.target[0]` to `event.target].[0]`.
Here's the updated code:
```typescript
counterForm.addEventListener(""submit"", event => {
  event.preventDefault();
  if (event.target) {
    console.log(event.target.[0]);
  }
});
```
This should fix the squiggly red line under `event.target[0]`.
Also, worth noting is that `event.target` is a `EventTarget` object, so you may also use `event.target.children[0]` to access the first child element of the `event.target` object, which in this case is the input element.

but it could be quite large, the names would vary in number and suffix, .number.suffix is a group to average throughout.
I would like to average the contents of prefix.1.suffix with prefix.3.suffix with prefix.5.suffix and put these averages in a new column prefix.135.suffix
I have tried
avg135 = df_ex.columns[(df.columns.str.contains('alpha.1') | df.columns.str.contains('alpha.3') | 
                           df.columns.str.contains('alpha.5')].tolist()

to create a list of columns to slice the data frame because there could be more than the headers seen here and I want the option to select a subset. But the rest, grouping similar suffix and averaging them is a bit out of my programming skills.
","You can use MultiIndex:
# Split each column header into a 3-tuple, e.g.: (&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;try&quot;),
# (&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;test&quot;), etc.
df_ex.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([col.split(&quot;.&quot;) for col in df_ex.columns])

# Group by prefix and suffix and take the mean of each column group
result = df_ex.groupby(level=[0,2], axis=1).mean()

# Rename the resulting columns
result.columns = [f&quot;{a}.135.{b}&quot; for a, b in result.columns]

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To average the values in the columns with similar suffixes, you can use the pandas groupby function. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
# create a list of column names that match the pattern
prefix_suffix = ['alpha.1', 'alpha.3', 'alpha.5']
# group the data frame by the prefix column and calculate the mean of the values in the suffix columns
df_ex.groupby(df_ex['prefix'].apply(lambda x: [x.str.slice(0,2)])).agg({'suffix': 'mean'})

# output:

    prefix      suffix
    0    alpha.1        2.5
    1    alpha.3       11.0
    2    alpha.5       6.5

In this example, we first create a list of column names that match the pattern `'alpha.1', 'alpha.3', 'alpha.5'`, which you provided. We then use the `groupby()` function to group the data frame by the `prefix` column, and calculated the mean of the values in the `suffix` columns for each group. Finally, we reset the index and columns to make the output more readable.
Note that in the `groupby()` function, I used the `apply()` function to create a sequence of slice indices for each prefix column. The `slice(0,2)` operator extracts the first two characters of each prefix column, which are the same for all suffix columns. This allows us to group the data frame by the prefix column and calculate the mean of the values in the suffix columns for each group.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",0.7471796870231628,"pandas, average, prefix, suffix",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74065917,Looking to get the frequency of an int array through a hashmap,"public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0 || k &lt;= 0) return new int[0];
    Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; freqMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (int currNum : nums) freqMap.put(currNum, freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1);

I don't understand what the .getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1); is doing, but it seems to calculate the frequency properly. I'd like some clearance on this method please and how exactly it's working.
","
The getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue) method of Map
interface, implemented by HashMap class is used to get the value
mapped with specified key. If no value is mapped with the provided key
then the default value is returned.
Syntax: default V getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)
Parameters: This method accepts two parameters:

key: which is the key of the element whose value has to be obtained.

defaultValue: which is the default value that has to be returned, if no value is mapped with the specified key.


Return Value: This method returns value mapped with the specified key, otherwise default value is returned.

Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashmap-getordefaultkey-defaultvalue-method-in-java-with-examples/
So, by using that method, first, you're trying to get key's value from the freqMap. If you can find it in map, then you're adding 1 to it and putting it back to freqMap. So, that means that you encountered this key before. Otherwise, that method , .getOrDefault(), returns you default value, which is 0, then you're adding 1 to it since you encountered it recently. And putting that value 1 to back to map. So, in the future, when you see that key again, you'll get it's value 1 that you added to the map before, will increase it to 2, and will put it back into the map.
","  The code you provided is using a `HashMap` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the input `int` array `nums`. Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. `if (nums == null || nums.length == 0 || k &lt;= 0) return new int[0];`: This checks if the input array is null, has length 0, or the `k` parameter is negative (which means you don't want to find the top `k` frequent elements). If any of these conditions are true, the method returns an empty array `new int[0]`.
2. `Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();`: This line creates a new `Map` object named `freqMap` and initializes it with keys of type `Integer` and values of type `Integer`.
3. `for (int currNum : nums) freqMap.put(currNum, freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0) + 1);`: This loop iterates over the elements of the input `int` array `nums`. For each element `currNum`, it checks if the corresponding value in the `freqMap` is not null (i.e., if there is already an entry for that element). If that's the case, it increments the value of the entry by 1. If not, it creates a new entry with the value 1.
The `.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)` method is used to retrieve the value associated with the key `currNum` in the `freqMap`. If the key is not present in the map (i.e., the value is null), the method returns the default value `0` (which is assigned to the key). This ensures that if an element is not present in the map yet, its frequency is initialized to 0.
So, the code is effectively maintaining a count of the frequency of each element in the input array using a `HashMap`. The `.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)` method ensures that the frequency of each element is initialized to 0 if it's not present in the map yet.
For example, if the input array is `[3, 2, 5, 2, 3]`, the `freqMap` would contain the following entries:
* `3`: 2
* `2`: 2
* `5`: 1
The method returns an array of the top `k` frequent elements, which in this case would be `3`, `2`, and `5`.",0.5657100081443787,java,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","It looks like this logic works properly for the example file in question:
$file = Get-Content path\to\examplefile.txt
$(

    ($file[-1] -as [xml]).SelectNodes('*/LINEITEM').ForEach{
        $_.LINEITEMFIELD.Trim() -join ';'
    }
)

Basically, leave the all lines up until the one before last as they are and the last line treat it as an XML.
Implementing this in your loop, the code would look like this:
foreach($file in $list) {
    $filename   = $file.Name
    $file       = $importfolder + $file.Name
    $outputfile = $outputfolder + $filename

    $content = Get-Content $file

            $_.LINEITEMFIELD.Trim() -join ';'
        }
    ) | Set-Content $outputfile
}

","  To achieve the desired output, you can use a combination of the `Select-Object` cmdlet to remove the unwanted characters and the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet to replace the characters with the desired output.
Here's an example code snippet that should help you achieve the desired output:
```powershell
$list = Get-ChildItem -Path $files | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
ForEach($file in $list) {
    $filename = $file
    $file = $importfolder + $file
    $outputfile = $outputfolder + $filename
    $content = Get-Content $file |
    ForEach-Object {
        if ($_\ -Match '^[a-zA-Z0-9space]$') { # Check if the current character is alphabetical or numerical
            $output = $Replace1 + $_, # Replace the character with the desired output
        } else { # Output the line as is
            $output = $_
        }
        Write-Host $output # Output the modified line
    } | Set-Content $outputfile # Save the modified line to the output file
}
```
In this code, we first use the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get the list of files in the specified path. Then, we loop through the list of files using the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet and use the `Select-Object` cmdlet to remove the unwanted characters from the file content.
The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet is then used to loop through the modified file content and replace the unwanted characters with the desired output. Finally, the modified line is output to the output file using the `Set-Content` cmdlet.
Note that in the regular expression `^[a-zA-Z0-9space]$`, the `^` symbol matches the beginning of the line, and the `[a-zA-Z0-9space]` pattern matches any alphabetical or numerical character or space. The `$_` variable in the regular expression refers to the current character being processed in the loop.",0.6127077341079712,powershell,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I use Performance Counter but it needs administration privilege which is not possible on App Service. on another hand it only works fully functional if the operation system of App Service is Windows.
Does someone know how I can get the CPU usage of my application on Azure App Service programmatically?
","For a cross platform cpu measurement use event counters:

EventCounters are .NET APIs used for lightweight, cross-platform, and near real-time performance metric collection. EventCounters were added as a cross-platform alternative to the &quot;performance counters&quot; of .NET Framework on Windows. In this article, you'll learn what EventCounters are, how to implement them, and how to consume them.
The .NET runtime and a few .NET libraries publish basic diagnostics information using EventCounters starting in .NET Core 3.0. Apart from the EventCounters that are provided by the .NET runtime, you may choose to implement your own EventCounters. EventCounters can be used to track various metrics. Learn more about them in well-known EventCounters in .NET
EventCounters live as a part of an EventSource, and are automatically pushed to listener tools on a regular basis. Like all other events on an EventSource, they can be consumed both in-proc and out-of-proc via EventListener and EventPipe. This article focuses on the cross-platform capabilities of EventCounters, and intentionally excludes PerfView and ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) - although both can be used with EventCounters.

There are several event counter provided by the .Net framework, listened here.
You can listen to these events in-proc using an EventListener. The code below shows an example implementation. The value of EventCounterIntervalSec determines the frequency in seconds of the measurements.
First, we need a hosted service that listens to the runtime event source during the lifetime of the web app process
public class CpuUsageListenerService : BackgroundService
{
    private CpuUsageListener cpuListener;

    protected override Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        cpuListener = new CpuUsageListener();

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public double LastValue =&gt; cpuListener.LastValue;
}

public sealed class CpuUsageListener : EventListener
{
    public double LastValue { get; private set; }

    protected override void OnEventSourceCreated(EventSource eventSource)
    {
        if (eventSource.Name.Equals(&quot;System.Runtime&quot;))
            EnableEvents(eventSource, EventLevel.LogAlways, EventKeywords.All, new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { &quot;EventCounterIntervalSec&quot;, &quot;1&quot; } });
    }

    protected override void OnEventWritten(EventWrittenEventArgs eventData)
    {
        if (eventData.EventName != &quot;EventCounters&quot;)
            return;

        var payload = (IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)eventData.Payload[0];
        var isCpuCounterValue = payload[&quot;Name&quot;] == &quot;cpu-usage&quot;;
        if (!isCpuCounterValue)
            return;

        LastValue = (double)payload[&quot;Mean&quot;];
        Console.WriteLine(LastValue); // Output value to console every second
    }
}

Register the service in your startup.cs:
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
            
    services.AddSingleton&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;();
    services.AddHostedService(sp =&gt; sp.GetService&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;());
            
    ...
}

The, finally, in your controller you can get the last value like this:
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService;

    public ValuesController(CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService)
    {
        this.cpuUsageListenerService = cpuUsageListenerService;
    }

    [HttpGet(&quot;/api/cpu&quot;)]
    public ActionResult&lt;double&gt; CpuUsage()
    {
        return cpuUsageListenerService.LastValue;
    }
}

","  Yes, I can certainly help you with that! Measuring CPU usage for an application hosted on Azure App Service can be a bit challenging due to the lack of access to performance counters without administrative privileges. However, there are a few approaches you can take to achieve this:
1. Use Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor provides a feature called ""CPU Usage"" that can be used to monitor the CPU usage of your application. To access this feature, go to the Azure Portal, navigate to your App Service, and click on ""Overview"" in the left-hand menu. In the ""Overview"" blade, you should see a ""Monitoring"" tab. Click on this tab, and you will see a ""CPU Usage"" chart that displays the CPU usage of your application over time.
However, this approach has a limitation that it only shows the CPU usage for the last 5 minutes. If you want to monitor the CPU usage for a longer period, you will need to use a third-party library or a custom solution.
2. Use a third-party library: There are several third-party libraries available that can help you measure the CPU usage of your application hosted on Azure App Service. One such library is ""System.Diagnostics.Process"" which is available in .NET framework. You can use this library to launch a process that runs on the server hosting your application and measure its CPU usage.
Here's an example of how you can use this library to measure the CPU usage of your application:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Diagnostics.Process;
namespace MeasureCPUUsage
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Launch a process that runs on the server hosting your application
            Process proces = new Process();
            proces.StartInfo.FileName = ""cmd.exe"";
            proces.StartInfo.Arguments = ""/C @echo CPU Usage: "";
            proces.Start();

            // Measure the CPU usage of the process
            proces.WaitForExit();
            string cpuUsage = proces.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
            Console.WriteLine($""CPU Usage: {cpuUsage}"");

        }
    }

```
This code will launch a command prompt process that runs on the server hosting your application and measures the CPU usage of the process using the ""cpu Usage"" command. You can then read the output of the command to get the CPU usage of your application.
3. Use a custom solution: If you want to measure the CPU usage of your application for a longer period than the Azure Monitor provides, you can create a custom solution that runs on the App Service container. This solution can use performance counters to measure the CPU usage of your application.
Here's an example of how you can create a custom solution that measures the CPU usage of your application:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Threading;
using Azure.AppService.Extensions;
namespace MeasureCPUUsage
{
    public class CPUUsage : IWorker
    {
        private readonly PerformanceCounter _cpuUsageCounter;

        public CPUUsage(IAppService appService)
        {
            _cpuUsageCounter = appService.GetExtension<IExtension<PerformanceCounter>>()!;

            _cpuUsageCounter.CounterName = ""Process"";

            _cpuUsageCounter.MaxDataAgeSec = 10; // Set the maximum age of the counter data to 10 seconds

        }

        public async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var currentCpuUsage = await _cpuUsageCounter.ReadValueAsync(cancellationToken);
            // Measure the CPU usage of your application
            var applicationCpuUsage = currentCpuUsage * 100;
            Console.WriteLine($""CPU Usage: {applicationCpuUsage}"");

        }

    }

}

```
This code creates a custom extension that registers a performance counter that measures the CPU usage of your application. The counter is named ""Process"" and its maximum age is set to 10 seconds. The ExecuteAsync method reads the value of the counter and measures the CPU usage of your application as a percentage.
In summary, measuring CPU usage for an application hosted on Azure App Service can be challenging due to the lack of access to performance counters without administrative privileges. However, using Azure Monitor, a third-party library, or a custom solution can help you achieve this.",0.55780029296875,"c#, azure, azure-appservice",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Does someone know how I can get the CPU usage of my application on Azure App Service programmatically?
","For a cross platform cpu measurement use event counters:

EventCounters are .NET APIs used for lightweight, cross-platform, and near real-time performance metric collection. EventCounters were added as a cross-platform alternative to the &quot;performance counters&quot; of .NET Framework on Windows. In this article, you'll learn what EventCounters are, how to implement them, and how to consume them.
The .NET runtime and a few .NET libraries publish basic diagnostics information using EventCounters starting in .NET Core 3.0. Apart from the EventCounters that are provided by the .NET runtime, you may choose to implement your own EventCounters. EventCounters can be used to track various metrics. Learn more about them in well-known EventCounters in .NET
EventCounters live as a part of an EventSource, and are automatically pushed to listener tools on a regular basis. Like all other events on an EventSource, they can be consumed both in-proc and out-of-proc via EventListener and EventPipe. This article focuses on the cross-platform capabilities of EventCounters, and intentionally excludes PerfView and ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) - although both can be used with EventCounters.

There are several event counter provided by the .Net framework, listened here.
You can listen to these events in-proc using an EventListener. The code below shows an example implementation. The value of EventCounterIntervalSec determines the frequency in seconds of the measurements.
First, we need a hosted service that listens to the runtime event source during the lifetime of the web app process
public class CpuUsageListenerService : BackgroundService
{
    private CpuUsageListener cpuListener;

    protected override Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        cpuListener = new CpuUsageListener();

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public double LastValue =&gt; cpuListener.LastValue;
}

public sealed class CpuUsageListener : EventListener
{
    public double LastValue { get; private set; }

    protected override void OnEventSourceCreated(EventSource eventSource)
    {
        if (eventSource.Name.Equals(&quot;System.Runtime&quot;))
            EnableEvents(eventSource, EventLevel.LogAlways, EventKeywords.All, new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { &quot;EventCounterIntervalSec&quot;, &quot;1&quot; } });
    }

    protected override void OnEventWritten(EventWrittenEventArgs eventData)
    {
        if (eventData.EventName != &quot;EventCounters&quot;)
            return;

        var payload = (IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)eventData.Payload[0];
        var isCpuCounterValue = payload[&quot;Name&quot;] == &quot;cpu-usage&quot;;
        if (!isCpuCounterValue)
            return;

        LastValue = (double)payload[&quot;Mean&quot;];
        Console.WriteLine(LastValue); // Output value to console every second
    }
}

Register the service in your startup.cs:
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
            
    services.AddSingleton&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;();
    services.AddHostedService(sp =&gt; sp.GetService&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;());
            
    ...
}

The, finally, in your controller you can get the last value like this:
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService;

    public ValuesController(CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService)
    {
        this.cpuUsageListenerService = cpuUsageListenerService;
    }

    [HttpGet(&quot;/api/cpu&quot;)]
    public ActionResult&lt;double&gt; CpuUsage()
    {
        return cpuUsageListenerService.LastValue;
    }
}

","To get the CPU usage of your application hosted on Azure App Service programmatically, you can use the Azure Monitor Metrics API. This API allows you to query and retrieve various metrics, including CPU usage, for your Azure resources.

Here are the steps to accomplish this:

1. First, you need to authenticate your application with Azure. You can use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication or a service principal for this purpose.

2. Once authenticated, you can use the Azure Monitor Metrics API to query the CPU usage metric for your App Service instance. The API provides a REST endpoint that allows you to retrieve the metric data.

3. To query the CPU usage metric, you need to specify the appropriate parameters such as the resource URI of your App Service instance, the metric name (e.g., ""\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time""), and the time range for which you want to retrieve the data.

4. Send an HTTP GET request to the Azure Monitor Metrics API endpoint with the required parameters. You can use the HttpClient class in C# to send the request and receive the response.

5. Parse the response to extract the CPU usage data. The response will typically be in JSON format, and you can deserialize it into a suitable data structure in C# to work with the CPU usage values.

6. Finally, you can process and use the CPU usage data as per your application requirements. You can display it in a dashboard, log it for analysis, or take any other action based on the CPU usage value.

It's important to note that the Azure Monitor Metrics API is available for all Azure resources, including Azure App Service, and does not require administrative privileges. Additionally, this approach is platform-independent and works irrespective of the operating system of your App Service instance.

By using this method, you can programmatically retrieve and monitor the CPU usage of your application hosted on Azure App Service.",0.5630857944488525,"c#, azure, azure-appservice",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

var newa= document.createElement('p'); 
  newa.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;span&gt;Or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a&gt;make your renewal payment&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;

I added it this way because the client needs them to have different styles with a border in the anchor only.
I tried this:
var linkdiv = document.querySelector(&quot;.renewnow&quot;); /*parent div*/
const getlink = linkdiv.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;);
getlink.href=&quot;/newa&quot;

I feel it's not possible to do that, but I tried it anyway
","The way you are trying to handle the element with innerHTML is not wrong, but then you have a string that you have to work with and the only way to modify this string is using Regex. But there is an easier way if you just create all required elements.


const p = document.createElement('p');
const span = document.createElement('span');
span.innerText = 'Or ';
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.innerText = 'make your renewal payment';
a.href = 'https://example.com';

p.append(span);
p.append(a);

document.body.append(p);



","  Yes, you are correct that it is not possible to set the `href` attribute of an `a` element inside a `p` element directly using JavaScript. This is because the `a` element is a descendant of the `p` element, and therefore, the `href` attribute can only be set on the element itself, not on its descendants.
However, there are a few ways you can achieve this:
1. Use a nested `a` element: You can create a new `a` element inside the `p` element using the `createElement` method, like this:
```
var newa = document.createElement('a');
newa.innerHTML = `&lt;span&gt;Or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a&gt;make your renewal payment&lt;/a&gt;`;

var parent = document.querySelector('.renewnow');
parent.appendChild(newa);
```
This way, you create a new `a` element inside the `p` element and set its `innerHTML` to the desired value.
2. Use the `querySelectorAll` method: You can use the `querySelectorAll` method to get all the `a` elements inside the `p` element, and then set the `href` attribute of each `a` element to the desired value:
```
var linkdiv = document.querySelector('.renewnow'); /*parent div*/
var links = linkdiv.querySelectorAll('a');
links.forEach(function(link) {
link.href = '/newa';

 });
```
This method will return all the `a` elements inside the `p` element, and you can then iterate over them and set the `href` attribute of each `a` element to the desired value.
Note: In both the above examples, the `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` methods are used to select the `a` elements inside the `p` element, and then the `href` attribute is set on those elements.

// What would make sense:
bar.remove(&quot;a&quot;); // remove the element &quot;a&quot;

In short, in a List&lt;String&gt;, you're usually going to be calling remove(String) or removeAll(Collection&lt;String&gt;), not remove(List&lt;String&gt;), which won't really do what you want.
","  The warning you're seeing in IntelliJ is related to the fact that the `bar` list is assigned a new list instance that is backed by the `foo` list, but then attempts to manipulate the original `foo` list through the `bar` reference. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if `foo` is null, as you mentioned.
In your first example, `bar` is created using `new ArrayList<>(foo)`, which means that it is a new list instance that is backed by the `foo` list. However, when you call `bar.remove(foo)`, IntelliJ is warning you that the `List<String>` type of `bar` may not contain objects of type `List<String>`. This is because the `bar` list is not the same as the `foo` list, even though they share the same type.
In your second example, you're using the `if` statement to check if `foo` and `bar` are not null before removing the element from `bar`. This is a good practice, as it avoids the potential issue of attempting to manipulate a null list.
To resolve the warning, you can either:
1. Remove the element from the `bar` list directly, without using the `foo` reference:
```
bar.remove(""a"");
```
or

List&lt;String&gt; bar = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(foo);
bar.remove(""a"");
```
2. Initialize the `bar` list with a copy of the `foo` list using `List.copyOf()`:

List&lt;String&gt; bar = List.copyOf(foo);
bar.remove(""a"");
```
By doing so, you ensure that `bar` is a separate instance of the list, unrelated to `foo`.
In summary, the warning you're seeing in IntelliJ is related to the potential issue of manipulating a null list. To resolve the warning, you can use one of the approaches mentioned above to ensure that you're working with separate instances of the list.",0.614858090877533,"java, intellij-idea, intellij-14",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73410047,Displaying random RGB pixels in Python,"I am starting a little project and I am having some difficulty in finding the answer that I am looking for. I don't really know exactly what terms I should be using to search, and couldn't find anything similar so I am sorry if this has been asked previously.
I am essentially trying to have a 2D plot of a set size, 300x300 for example full of random RGB pixels. I have figured out how to plot them with imshow and remove the axis labels so far, but it looks odd like it is zoomed in too far. Also, I know I can use RGB arguements in imshow, but the matplotlib manual touches on it, but never gives any examples. The closest cmap I have found to RGB is hsv so I am using that for now until I find the RGB solution.
Can anyone help me with assigning a random RGB value to each pixel instead of using cmap, and maybe adjusting the apparent size of the image so the pixels are less &quot;zoomed in&quot;? I am open to using something other than imshow for flexibility, it is just the only thing I found to do what I want. Thank you very much in advance!
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
from numpy import random

Z = random.random((300,300))
plt.imshow(Z, cm.get_cmap(&quot;hsv&quot;), interpolation='nearest')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

","Here's how you do it with PIL:
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

data = (np.random.random( (300,300,3) ) * 256).astype(np.uint8)
img = Image.fromarray(data)
img.show()
img.save('rand.png')

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To assign a random RGB value to each pixel and adjust the apparent size of the image, you can use the `imshow` function from matplotlib with the `interpolation` parameter set to `'nearest'`. This will display the pixels as individual points instead of a continuous image, which is what you're looking for.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

Z = np.random.random((300,300))
# Assign a random RGB value to each pixel
red = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=Z.shape[0])
green = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=Z.shape[0])
blue = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=Z.shape[0])
# Create a new image with the RGB values

img = np.dstack((red, green, blue))

# Display the image with interpolation set to nearest

plt = plt.imshow(img, interpolation='nearest')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```
In this example, we first generate a random RGB value for each pixel using the `np.random.randint` function. Then, we create a new image with the RGB values by stacking the red, green, and blue values using the `np.dstack` function. Finally, we display the image using `imshow` with the `interpolation` parameter set to `'nearest'`. This will display the pixels as individual points, regardless of their actual size.
If you want to adjust the apparent size of the image, you can use the `scale` parameter of `imshow`. For example, to display the image with a scale factor of 2, you can call `t.scale(2)` before displaying it.

Axios Error

details of request/response


Response of login

","Update 2
Having seen the code, I think the problem is here:
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

axios.defaults.baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

if (localStorage.getItem('user')) {
    const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${user?.accessToken}`;
}

this will read the axios.defaults.headers when the helpers/axios.js file is loaded. This is why axios.get('/users'); only works on second load, or rather only when the authentication is already loaded into localStorage. A change to the user object or a local storage will not update since this code only runs once at the beginning, the change to axios.defaults.headers needs to be dynamic.
Update
if setTimeout didn't work that could be due to a different issue. Also, if your request works a second time, but it also works if the authentication is passed directly, it seems to me that it has something to do with the authentication being handled implicitly.
I think what's happening is that you are creating multiple instances of axios and relying on shared authentication
// create single axios instance
export const api = axios.create({
   withCredentials: true,
   baseURL: BASE_URL // optional
})

// then use
await api.post('/auth/login', {
  username: username,
  password: password
});

// and 
await api.get('/users');

This might make the axios instance remember the authentication information between calls. It may still require handling race condition if you have an app that doesn't wait on the login request to finish.

I think this is just an issue with a race condition
POST:/login and GET:/users requests appear to be done in parallel.
onMounted( async () =&gt; {
  // this should wait until the `login` has been handled
  const response = await axios.get('/users');
  users.value = response.data;
})

I don't see how you call login so can't offer the the exact solution, but if you can store the login request state as a reactive variable, you can do something like
watch: {
  loginState:{
    immediate: true
    handler(value){
      if (value === LOADED) {
        const response = await axios.get('/users');
        users.value = response.data;
      }
    }
  }
})

here's what the changes to the authStore might look like
export const STATES = {
  INIT:&quot;INIT&quot;,
  PROCESSING:&quot;PROCESSING&quot;,
  ERROR:&quot;ERROR&quot;,
  LOADED:&quot;LOADED&quot;,
}
export const loginState = ref(STATES.INIT);

async login (username, password) {
    loginState.value = STATES.PROCESSING
    try{
      const response = await axios.post('/auth/login', {
        username: username,
        password: password
      });
      loginState.value = STATES.LOADED
      this.user = response.data;
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(this.user));

      await router.push('/');
    }catch(e){
      // handle error
      loginState.value = STATES.ERROR
    }
},

","  The issue you're facing is that Vue is not fetching data from the API in the first render after logging in. This is because the `this.user` object is not available in the component until the `mounted` lifecycle hook is executed, which happens after the component has been instantiated and mounted to the DOM.
Here are some possible solutions:

1. Using **async** lifecycle hooks: Instead of using the `mounted` hook, you can use the `created` or `prepended` hook to fetch the data from the API in the first render. These hooks are executed before the component is mounted to the DOM, so you can retrieve the data from the API in these hooks.
Here's an example of how you can use the `created` hook to fetch data from the API in the first render:
```javascript
<script setup>
    const response = await axios.get('/users');
users.value = response.data;
</script>
```
1. Using **@Watch**: You can also use the `@Watch` decorator to watch the `user` object and fetch data from the API whenever the `user` object changes. This can be useful if you have some other data that is dependent on the `user` object.
Here's an example of how you can use `@Watch` to fetch data from the API whenever the `user` object changes:
```javascript setup script>
<script setup>
    const response = await axios.get('/users');
users.value = response.data;

@Watch('user', {
    deep: true
})
fetchData() {
    axios.get('/users');
}

</script>

```1. Using a **ref**: Another option is to use a `ref` to fetch the data from the API in the first render. A `ref` is a special type of Vue component that returns a Vue instance. You can use a `ref` to wrap the `axios.get` call and return the data from the API.
Here's an example of how you can use a `ref` to fetch data from the API in the first render:

```javascript setup script>

<script setup>

const response = useRef(async () => {

    const result = await axios.get('/users');

return result.data;


}).value;

users.value = response.value;


</script>

```1. Using **Vuex**: If you're using Vuex, you can use the `useStore` hook to fetch data from the API in the first render. The `useStore` hook returns a Vuex store instance, which you can use to fetch data from the API.
Here's an example of how you can use `useStore` to fetch data from the API in the first render:

```javascript setup script>

<script setup>

const store = useStore();

const response = await axios.get('/users');

store.dispatch('fetchUsers', {
    data: response.data
});

users.value = response.data;


</script>

```
These are some possible solutions to fetch data from the API in the first render after logging in. You can choose the approach that best fits your requirement.",0.5733366012573242,"vue.js, axios, vuejs3, vue-router",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

But I have no access to note.id here:  @deleteItem=&quot;deleteNote(note.id)&quot;. Any ideas, how to solve this problem?
","Try this approach.
When you click on the div, instead of set visibality of modal,

set selectedItem
set visibility

then you accept by modal, you have a `selectedItem' for delete
After delete, clear the selectedItem.
","  To get the `id` of the note that was clicked on within the modal, you can pass it as a prop to the modal component and then use it to delete the note when the user accepts the modal. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:
In your `DeleteModal` component:
```javascript
<template>
  <div class=""modal"" :class=""{ 'modal-full': modalFull }"">
    <div class=""modal-content"">
      <h3 v-if=""modalType"">{{ modalTitle }}</h3>
      <div class=""text-center text-xl"">
        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-link"" @click=""modalType = false; modalVisible = false"">
          {{ __('general.cancel') }}
        </button>
        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-link"" @click=""deleteItem"">
          {{ __('general.delete') }}
        </button>

      </div>

    </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      modalVisible: false,
      modalType: null,
      noteId: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    deleteItem() {
      this.deleteNote(this.noteId);
      this.modalVisible = false;
    },
    // Get the ID of the note that was clicked on
    getNoteId(note) {
      this.noteId = note.id;
      return this.noteId;
    },
  },
};
```
In your `Note` component:

```javascript

<template>

  <div v-for=""note in notesForIssue"" :key=""note.id"">

    <div class=""flex flex-row justify-between"">

      <div class=""px-8 py-4"">

        <p>{{ note.text }}</p>

      </div>

      <div class=""flex flex-row items-center justify-between"">

        <span class=""text-[#2563EB]"">{{ note.updated_at }}</span>

        <p class=""ml-2"">{{ __('history.by') }}</p>

        <p class=""font-bold ml-2 text-[#2563EB]"">{{ note.updated_by }}</p>

      </div>

      <div @click.prevent=""modalType = 'accept'; modalVisible = true"">

      </div>

    </div>

  </template>

<script>

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      notesForIssue: null,
      issueId: null,
    };
  },
  computed: {
    getNoteId() {
      return this.notesForIssue.find(note => note.id === this.issueId);
    },
  },
  methods: {
    deleteNote(id) {

      // Call the deleting function here
      this.$inertia.delete(route('notes.destroy', id));

      this.notesForIssue = this.notesForIssue.filter((note) => note.id !== id);

      this.issueId = null;

    },
  },
};
```
In your `notesForIssue` data:

```javascript

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      notes: null,
      issueId: null,
    };
  },
};
```
Now, when you render a note, you can get the `id` of the note that was clicked on within the modal by using the `getNoteId` method in your `Note` component:

```javascript

<div class=""my-4"" v-for=""note in notesForIssue"" :key=""note.id"">

    <div class=""flex flex-row justify-between"">

      <div class=""px-8 py-4"">

        <p>{{ note.text }}</p>

      </div>

      <div class=""flex flex-row items-center justify-between"">

        <span class=""text-[#2563EB]"">{{ note.updated_at }}</span>

        <p class=""ml-2"">{{ __('history.by') }}</p>

        <p class=""font-bold ml-2 text-[#2563EB]"">{{ note.updated_by }}</p>

      </div>

      <div @click.prevent=""modalType = 'accept'; modalVisible = true"" :id=""note.id"">


      </div>

    </div>

```
In your `DeleteModal` component, you can then use the `noteId` prop to delete the note:

```javascript

deleteItem() {
      this.$inertia.delete(route('notes.destroy', this.noteId));

      this.modalVisible = false;

    },
```
Note that I've modified the `DeleteModal` component to accept a `noteId` prop, which you can pass in from your `Note` component using the `getNoteId` method. This will give you the `id` of the note that was clicked on within the modal, which you can then use to delete the note.",0.6292864680290222,"vue.js, vuejs3, vue-composition-api, vue-script-setup",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","To solve the problem of not having access to the note ID in the modal component, you can make use of a data property and a method in the parent component that handles the rendering of notes.

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

1. In your parent component, create a data property called `selectedNoteId` and initialize it with `null`:
```javascript
data() {
  return {
    selectedNoteId: null,
    // other data properties
  }
},
```

2. Modify the rendering of notes in the parent component to include a click event that sets the `selectedNoteId` when the delete button is clicked:
```html
<div @click=""selectedNoteId = note.id""></div>
```

3. Update the `@deleteItem` event in the modal component to use the `selectedNoteId` instead of `note.id`:
```html
<DeleteModal
  :modalVisible=""modalVisible""
  :restore=""modalType""
  @closeModal=""modalVisible = false""
  @deleteItem=""deleteNote(selectedNoteId)""
  @restoreItem=""restore()""
/>
```

4. In the delete method of the parent component, you can now access the correct note ID using `selectedNoteId`:
```javascript
const deleteNote = (id) => {
  Inertia.delete(route('notes.destroy', id));
  getNotes();
};
```

By setting the `selectedNoteId` in the parent component when the delete button is clicked, you can then pass that value to the modal component and use it in the delete method.",0.605366587638855,"vue.js, vuejs3, vue-composition-api, vue-script-setup",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

For example, to extract the p-value for the comparison between the `HC` and `CONN` groups in the `fusiform` subtest, you can use the following code:
```
A$""fusiform""[,""p.value""]
```
This will give you the p-value for the comparison between the `HC` and `CONN` groups in the `fusiform` subtest.
You can also use the `summary()` function to extract the statistics for each comparison in a tidy format:
```
A$""summary()""
```
This will give you a tibble with the p-value, t statistic, confidence interval, and group means for each comparison.
If you want to extract specific values from the result objects, you can use indexing and subsetting. For example, to extract the t statistic for the comparison between the `HC` and `CONN` groups in the `fusiform` subtest, you can use the following code:
```
A$""fusiform""[,""t.statistic""]
```
This will give you the t statistic for the comparison between the `HC` and `CONN` groups in the `fusiform` subtest.
You can also use the `colSums()` function to extract the sum of the t statistics for a specific column:
```
A$""fusiform""[,""t.statistic""]
colSums(A$""fusiform""[""t.statistic""])
```
This will give you the sum of the t statistics for the `fusiform` subtest.

73232841,How the datas are get in Power Bi (direct query) with a filter,"I was wondering, when you get the data in power bi (with Direct Query)
And you filter the data in the Power Query Editor.(Lignes filtrées = Filtered rows)
You will get the data first then you filter the data,
or you filter the data first the you get the data?

","Actually, both are data which contains different values.
PowerBI is operating data from top to bottom. So, it gets the data from Source, then navigates to the selected table, then applies filters and some other jobs.
So, getting the data first and then filtering it is meaningful because you can see all the data changes in the Edit Query page.
But getting the data after filtering it in query may also meaningful because all the filtering is handled in database and if you have a good infrastructure, your data will come faster.
And the best case approach is: &quot;using filtering in queries is OK but don't be complex on your database queries&quot;. So, there is no correct answer for your question, you should just use a little bit of this and that depend on the quality of your data.
","  When using Direct Query in Power BI, you can filter the data either before or after retrieving it from the source. The order in which you perform these operations does not affect the final result. Here's a step-by-step guide to filtering data in Power BI using Direct Query:
Step 1: Connect to the data source and select the relevant tables.
Step 2: In the Power Query Editor, click on the ""Filter"" button in the ""Modeling"" tab.
Step 3: Select the table or tables you want to filter, and then add the filter criteria. For example, if you are filtering a table called ""Sales"" based on a date range, you could enter ""Sales[Date] >= '2022-01-01' AND Sales[Date] <= '2022-01-31'"" in the filter dialog box.
Step 4: Apply the filter by clicking the ""OK"" button. The filtered data will be added to the query model.
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any additional filters you want to apply.
Step 6: When you are finished filtering the data, click ""Load Data"" to load the filtered data into Power BI.
It's important to note that when you filter data in Power BI using Direct Query, the filtering is done on the fly as you filter the data in the Power Query Editor. This means that the filtered data is loaded directly into Power BI without the need to refresh the query.
Alternatively, you can filter the data first and then retrieve it from the source. This approach can be useful when you have a large dataset and want to filter it before loading it into Power BI. Here's how to do it:
Step 1: Connect to the data source and select the relevant tables.
Step 2: Filter the data based on the desired criteria using the SQL syntax. For example, if you are filtering a table called ""Sales"" based on a date range, you could use the following SQL syntax:
""SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE Sales[Date] >= '2022-01-01' AND Sales[Date] <= '2022-01-31'""
Step 3: Save the filtered data as a new table in the data source. This will create a new table with only the filtered data.
Step 4: Disconnect from the data source and close the Power BI desktop app.
Step 5: Open Power BI again and load the filtered data into a new query. To do this, go to the ""Get Data"" tab in the Power BI ribbon and select ""From Other Sources"" > ""From Microsoft Query"". In the ""Microsoft Query"" dialog box, select the filtered data table that you created in step 3. Click ""OK"" to load the filtered data into Power BI.
In summary, you can filter data in Power BI using Direct Query either before or after retrieving it from the source. The order in which you perform these operations does not affect the final result.",0.6647050976753235,"powerbi, directquery",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Sure, I can help you with that! In PySimpleGUI, you can change the default behavior of using the tab key to move to the next input field by using the `set_keys` method of the `SGText` widget. Here's an example:
Let's say you have a form with an `SGText` widget for each input field, and you want to use the enter key to move to the next field. Here's how you can do it:
1. First, find the `SGText` widget that corresponds to the field you want to move to next. You can do this by iterating through all the widgets in the form using the `for` loop.
```
```
for widget in form.children():
    if isinstance(widget, SGText):
        # Do something with the widget
        break
```
1. Once you have the `SGText` widget that you want to change, use the `set_keys` method to set the enter key as the trigger for moving to the next field. Here's the code:
```
text_widget.set_keys([ord('Enter'),])
```
1. In this code, `text_widget` is the `SGText` widget that you want to change, and `ord('Enter')` is the ASCII value of the enter key (which is 10).

By setting the `set_keys` method to `ord('Enter')`, PySimpleGUI will recognize the enter key press as a request to move to the next input field.

Here's the complete code example:

import pySimpleGUI as sg

form = sg.Flexible()
text_widget1 = sg.Text('Text input 1', size=(20, 1))
text_widget2 = sg.Text('Text input 2', size=(20, 1))
text_widget3 = sg.Text('Text input 3', size=(20, 1))
form.add_with_padding(text_widget1, size=(100, 1))
form.add_with_padding(text_widget2, size=(100, 1))
form.add_with_padding(text_widget3, size=(100, 1))
form.set_keys([ord('Enter')])
sg.read()

This code creates a form with three `SGText` widgets for input fields, and sets the `set_keys` method to `ord('Enter')` for the form. Now, when you press the enter key while focused on one of the input fields, the focus will move to the next field.

I need the structs as pointers, because I save references to some of them e.g. to the player instance and they'll get invalidated otherwhise.
It seems I can neither pass the map nor the vectors by reference. So this..
    std::map&lt;myEnum, std::vector&lt;const myStruct&amp;&gt;&gt; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

..aswell as..
    const std::map&lt;myEnum, std::vector&lt;myStruct*&gt;&gt;&amp; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

doesnt work.
Is there any way to solve this?
Sorry if the question is dumb, I'm kinda new to C++ and often don't know what to search for.
Thanks for you help!
","First of all, you should declare the member function itself const, otherwise it can't pick the member function for the const circumstance when the object itself is const.
Second, you don't have to think about the exact typing, you can let the compiler figure it out by saying const auto&amp;. then it will return a constant reference, so it won't be modifiable:
const auto&amp; GameLogic::getMap() const {
    return myMap;
}

","  It's not dumb at all! Passing a mutable container without its contents being modifiable can be a challenge in C++, especially when working with enums and pointers to structs. Here are a few ways to solve the problem:
1. Use a const std::vector:
Instead of passing the entire vector by reference, you can pass a const std::vector instead. This ensures that the contents of the vector cannot be modified. You can do this by using a qualified name, like `const std::vector<const myStruct*>&`:
    std::map<myEnum, const std::vector<const myStruct*>&> getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

2. Use a std::vector of pointers to const myStruct:
Another option is to create a std::vector of pointers to const myStruct instead of a std::vector of myStruct. This way, the contents of the vector cannot be modified, and you can pass it by reference without any issues:
    std::map<myEnum, std::vector<const myStruct*>&gt; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }
3. Create a wrapper struct for myStruct:
If you can't change the code that uses the map, you can create a wrapper struct for myStruct that is mutable, but has a const pointer to the real myStruct inside. This way, you can pass the wrapper struct by reference without any issues:
    struct MyStructWrapper {
        const myStruct* ptr;
        MyStructWrapper(myStruct* p) : ptr(p) {}
    };

 Then, you can pass the wrapper struct by reference to the function that needs to access the map:
    std::map<myEnum, std::vector<MyStructWrapper*>&gt; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }
4. Use a boost::optional:
If you're using C++11 or later, you can use a boost::optional to wrap the struct and pass it by reference without any issues:
    std::map<myEnum, boost::optional<myStruct>&gt; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

By doing this, you ensure that the contents of the vector cannot be modified, and the struct is passed by reference without any issues.

","  The issue you're facing is that the `visibility` attribute in the `FloatingActionButton` widget is not being updated properly when you click on it again. This is because the `FloatingActionButton` widget is not attached to the UI thread, which means that the `visibility` attribute is not being updated immediately when you set it.
Here are a few solutions you can try to fix this issue:
1. Use a `Handler` to update the `visibility` attribute:
```java
        // Create a handler to update the visibility of the floating buttons
        Handler handler = new Handler(this);
        FloatingActionButton addFloatingBtn = findViewById(R.id.add_floating_btn);
        addFloatingBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Update the visibility of the floating buttons
                handler.post(() -> {
                    // Make the floating buttons visible
                    addVideoFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                    addNotesFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                    // Start the animation
                    addVideoFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);
                    addNotesFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);
                    addFloatingBtn.startAnimation(rotateOpen);
                    // Update the visibility of the floating buttons
                    isFloatingActionBtnVisible = true;
                    Toast.makeText(getContext(), ""Animation Added"", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                });
            }
        });
```
In this example, we create a `Handler` and use it to update the `visibility` attribute of the `FloatingActionButton` widget. The `Handler` will run on the UI thread, which means that the `visibility` attribute will be updated properly when you click on the button again.
2. Use a `Runnable` to update the `visibility` attribute:
```java

        // Create a runnable to update the visibility of the floating buttons

        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {

                // Make the floating buttons visible

                addVideoFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

                addNotesFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

                // Start the animation

                addVideoFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);

                addNotesFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);

                // Update the visibility of the floating buttons

                isFloatingActionBtnVisible = true;

                Toast.makeText(getContext(), ""Animation Added"", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }

        };

        // Set the runnable to update the visibility of the floating buttons

        addFloatingBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {

                // Run the runnable to update the visibility of the floating buttons

                Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);

                thread.start();
            }

        });
```
In this example, we create a `Runnable` and use it to update the `visibility` attribute of the `FloatingActionButton` widget. The `Runnable` will run on a separate thread, which means that the `visibility` attribute will be updated properly when you click on the button again.
3. Use a `LinearLayout.ferrer` attribute to update the `visibility` attribute:
```java

        // Set the LayoutManager to wrap the floating buttons

        LinearLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);

        // Set the LayoutManager to wrap the floating buttons

        layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(getContext(), LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false);

        // Add the LayoutManager to the floating buttons

        addFloatingBtn.setLayoutParams(layoutParams);

        addFloatingBtn.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);

        // Add the floating buttons to the layout

        layoutManager.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);

        layoutManager.addView(addVideoFloatingBtn);

        layoutManager.addView(addNotesFloatingBtn);

```
In this example, we use the `LinearLayout.ferrer` attribute to update the `visibility` attribute of the `FloatingActionButton` widget. The `LinearLayout.ferrer` attribute allows us to update the `visibility` attribute of the `FloatingActionButton` widget without having to use a `Handler`, `Runnable`, or separate thread.
I hope these solutions help you fix the issue with the `visibility` attribute not being updated properly when you click on the `FloatingActionButton` widget again. Let me know if you have any further questions!",0.3264991044998169,"java, android",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Thank you for providing the sample data and the desired output. Based on your description, I understand that you want to create a new column in the DataFrame `df` that contains the name of the column header if the value in the `our_value` column is between the lower and upper bounds of the respective column.
Here's a solution that uses a dictionary to map the column names to their corresponding lower and upper bounds, and then uses the `between` method to check if the value in `our_value` is between the lower and upper bounds of the column, and then assigns the column name to the new column `our_opt`.
import pandas as pd
# Create a dictionary of column names and their lower and upper bounds
opt_dict = {'opt1': [10, 20], 'opt2': [21, 30], 'opt3': [31, 40], 'opt4': [41, 50]}

# Apply the logic to the DataFrame
df['our_opt'] = df['our_value'].between(opt_dict[k[0]], opt_dict[k[1]])
   .apply(lambda x: k[0] if x < opt_dict[k[1]] else k[1])

The code works by creating a dictionary `opt_dict` that maps each column name to its lower and upper bounds. Then, we apply the `between` method to the `our_value` column and use the `apply` method to assign the column name to the new column `our_opt` if the value in `our_value` is between the lower and upper bounds of the column.
Note that the `between` method returns a boolean array, so we use the ternary operator (`if x < opt_dict[k[1]] else`) to assign the column name to the new column if the value in `our_value` is between the lower and upper bounds of the column.
Also, we use the `all()` method to check if the value in `our_value` is between the lower and upper bounds of the column for each row in the DataFrame, and assign the column name to the new column `our_opt` only if the value is between the lower and upper bounds of the column.

","To achieve the desired outcome of creating a column 'our_opt' that contains the name of the column header if the value in the 'our_value' column is between the two values in the respective column, you can use the following approach:

# Iterate over each row in the DataFrame
for index, row in sample_df.iterrows():
    our_value = row['our_value']
    
    # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame except 'our_value' and 'our_opt'

1         24  10 - 20  21 - 30  31 - 40  41 - 50    opt2
```

In this approach, we first create an empty 'our_opt' column in the DataFrame. Then, we iterate over each row and for each row, we iterate over each column (except 'our_value' and 'our_opt'). We split the values in the column to obtain the lower and upper bounds. We then check if the value in 'our_value' is between the lower and upper bounds. If it is, we assign the column name to the 'our_opt' column for that row.",0.6673468947410583,"python, pandas",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

If I run the main function, I will get back:
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_long finished in 0.20 seconds
    
[20, 10, 10]

which looks sensible, since sleep_short takes shorter time to complete. However, if I define the function:
async def main():
    tasks = [simple_count(), sleep_short(), sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

I will get this output:
Async function simple_count finished in 4.18 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds

which implies (?) that the simple_count coroutine is completed first, even though it is much slower to sleep_short.
I am pretty sure this is due to my misconception of how async/await works, so I would appreciate it, if you could help me understand this concept better through this example.
","Asynchronous functions allow you to run concurrent tasks, i.e. coroutines, that yield control back to the caller at certain points. Concurrent execution is by no means parallelization. For the latter you'll want to use threads or processes. Since _simple_count() only performs one lengthy task without ever yielding back control to the calling function, it will block other concurrent tasks until it is done, since you literally await its result in the timing decorator's wrapper.
","  No worries! You've provided a great example to demonstrate the confusion around asynchronous programming with `async/await` in Python. I'll break down the issue and explain how to fix it.
The problem is that you're expecting the `simple_count` coroutine to finish first, but it's actually running concurrently with the `sleep_short` coroutines, causing the unexpected output.
Here's what's happening:
1. `simple_count` is created as an asynchronous function using the `@timing_async` decorator. This means that the coroutine returned by `simple_count` will be executed concurrently with other coroutines in the `main` function.
2. When you call `gather` on the `tasks` list, it creates a new event loop and schedules all the coroutines in the list to run concurrently. Since `sleep_short` is a coroutine too, it'll be scheduled to run concurrently with `simple_count`.
3. Since `sleep_short` takes less time to complete than `simple_count`, it'll finish first and return its result before `simple_count` has a chance to finish.
4. When `simple_count` finally finishes, it'll return its result, but it'll be discarded since the `gather` function has already returned.
To fix this issue, you can use `asyncio.create_task` to schedule the `simple_count` coroutine as a separate task, ensuring it runs after the `sleep_short` coroutines:
 async def main():
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(sleep_short()), sleep_short(), asyncio.create_task(simple_count())]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

This code will output:
Async function simple_count finished in 4.18 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds

Explanation:
`asyncio.create_task` is a function that creates a new task for a coroutine, scheduling it to run in a separate event loop. When you use `create_task` on a coroutine, it'll be executed after all the coroutines scheduled in the same event loop.
By scheduling `simple_count` as a separate task using `create_task`, we ensure that it'll run after the `sleep_short` coroutines have finished, giving it a chance to complete before they do.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you fix the issue with your `Trans` component in React i18next. It looks like you're trying to display a link after the text ""Ich stimme die app"", but the link is not being displayed properly.
The problem is that in JavaScript, URLs are considered as strings, so when you use them within a react component, they are treated as text and not as links. To make it work, you need to wrap the URL in a React element that understood as a link, such as a `Link` component.
Here's an updated version of your `Trans` component that should work:
    &lt;Trans
      i18nKey=&quot;login_screen:terms_of_use&quot;
      components={{
        privacy_policy: (
          &lt;Link&gt;{t('privacy_policy')}&lt;/Link&gt;
          &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;
        ),
      }}
    /&gt; 

In this version, I've added a `Link` component around the `privacy_policy` prop, like this:
```{t('privacy_policy')}`
This will render a link that points to the value of the `privacy_policy` prop, which in your case is the URL ""https:....."".
Note that you may need to adjust the quotes around the JSON keys to match the syntax of your JSON file.

","  To achieve the desired output, you can use a combination of the `os` and `datetime` modules in Python. Here's an example solution:
First, define a function that takes a dictionary of `({path: {name, last_modified}})` and returns a list of objects with the minimum path and name:
```python
def get_min_path(data):
    min_path = None
    result = []
    for item in data:

        # Get the current path and name
        path = os.path.dirname(item['name']).strip('/')
        # Check if the path is shorter than the current minimum path
        if path.replace('/', '').startswith('/'):
            # If the path is shorter, update the minimum path and name
            if min_path is None or len(min_path) > len(path):
                min_path = path
                result.append({'name': item['name'], 'last_modified': item['last_modified']})

    return result
```
Now, apply the function to the list of dictionaries `data`:

data_dict = {}
for item in data:

    dir = os.path.dirname(item['name'])
    if dir not in data_dict:
        item['count'] = 1
        data_dict[dir] = item
    else:
        count = data_dic[dir]['count'] + 1
        if item['last_modified'] > data_dict[dir]['last_modified']:
            data_dict[dir] = item
        data_dic[dir]['count'] = count

result = list(get_min_path(data_dict.values()))

```
Explanation:

The function `get_min_path` takes a dictionary of `({path: {name, last_modified}})` and returns a list of objects with the minimum path and name. It works by:

1. Looping through each dictionary in the input list.
2. Extracting the path and name from each dictionary.
3. Checking if the current path is shorter than the current minimum path. If it is, update the minimum path and name.
4. Appending the new dictionary to a list.

The function uses the `os` module to extract the path and name from each dictionary. It uses the `.strip('/')` method to remove any unnecessary slashes from the path. It also uses the `.replace('/', '').startswith('/')` method to check if the path is shorter than the current minimum path.

In the second part of the code, we define a dictionary `data_dict` and loop through each dictionary in the input list. We apply the `get_min_path` function to each dictionary and store the results in a list. Finally, we print the list of objects with the minimum path and name.

The output should be:

```
data = [
        {'name': 'root/folder1/f1/s1.csv'},
        {'name': 'root/folder2/f2/s2/file.csv'}, 
        {'name': 'root/folder2/f_1/f_2/f_3/file.csv'},
        {'name': 'root/folder2/f3/s3/file.csv'},
        {'name': 'root/folder3/f3/s3/s4/file4.csv'}

    }
}

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To change the return type of the `colors()` function based on a condition, you can use a higher-order function (HOF) type. A HOF is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with a different return type.
Here's an example of how you can modify your `colors()` function to return either `LinearGradient` or `AngularGradient` based on the value of the `backgroundColor` variable:
```swift
func colors(backgroundColor: BackgroundType) -> ShapeStyle {
   // Check the value of backgroundColor and return the appropriate gradient
   if backgroundColor == .linear {
    return LinearGradient(
            gradient: Gradient(colors: [
                Color(red: 135/255, green: 206/255, blue: 235/255),
                Color(red: 255/255, green: 160/255, blue: 122/255)
            ]),
            startPoint: .topLeading,
            endPoint: .top
        )
   } else {
       return AngularGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [
            Color(red: 135/255, green: 206/255, blue: 235/255),
            Color(red: 255/255, green: 160/255, blue: 122/255)
        ]),
                        center: .topLeading,
                        angle: .degrees(180 + 45))
   }
}

In this example, we define a new function `colors(backgroundColor: BackgroundType)` that takes a `BackgroundType` parameter, which determines the return type of the function. We then use a HOF to create a new function that returns `LinearGradient` or `AngularGradient` based on the value of `backgroundColor`.
You can then use this function inside the `.background()` modifier like this:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
   @State private var backgroundColor: BackgroundType = .linear

   var body: some View {
      Rectangle(colors: colors(backgroundColor: $backgroundColor))
   }
```
In this example, we define a `backgroundColor` state variable and observe its value using the `@State` decorator. We then use the `colors()` function to create the background gradient, and pass the value of `backgroundColor` as a parameter to the function.

","The database is likely trying to join these tables on your != condition, and as a result is producing (or trying to produce) a cartesian product of the tables. Essentially all records from job are being joined with all records from job_application. Depending on table sizes this is likely a HUGE result.
Instead use NOT IN in your WHERE clause to filter the records in job:
SELECT job.*
FROM job
WHERE job.id NOT IN 
    (
         SELECT jobID 
         FROM job_application

    )

","  The issue you're experiencing with the SQL query editor freezing and crashing when running the query is likely due to one or more of the following reasons:
1. Subqueries: The query contains a subquery in the `WHERE` clause, which can cause performance issues and potential crashes.
2. Join operation: The query performs a join operation between the `job` and `job_application` tables, which can also lead to performance issues, especially if the tables are large.
To fix the issue, you can try the following approaches:
Approach 1: Optimize the query
1. Avoid using subqueries: Instead of using a subquery, you can use the `IN` operator to check if the `id` column in the `job_application` table exists in the `id` column of the `job` table. Here's an updated query:
SELECT job.*
FROM job
WHERE job.id NOT IN (SELECT jobId FROM job_application WHERE freelancerId = '4ac4bac0-23bf-4ff6-a3a6-61282e87f7bc');

This query avoids the subquery and uses the `IN` operator to check for the existence of the `id` column in the `job` table that corresponds to the `jobId` column in the `job_application` table.
1. Use indexes: Make sure to use indexes on the columns used in the `WHERE` and `JOIN` clauses to improve the query performance.
Approach 2: Optimize the database configuration

1. Check the database server configuration: Ensure that the database server has sufficient resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk space, to handle the query.
2. Optimize the database settings: Adjust the database settings, such as the buffer size and connectionlimit, to improve the query performance.

Approach 3: Break the query into smaller parts:

1. Split the query into smaller parts and execute each part separately to identify the part causing the issue.
2. Optimize each part of the query individually to improve performance.

Conclusion:

The issue you're experiencing with the SQL query editor freezing and crashing when running the query is likely due to one or more of the reasons mentioned above. By optimizing the query, using indexes, and adjusting the database settings, you can improve the query performance and avoid the issue. Additionally, breaking the query into smaller parts and executing each part separately can help identify the part causing the issue and improve performance.",0.7211430668830872,"sql, database, amazon-web-services, amazon-rds",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a Teradata query that should give you the desired results:
SELECT cust, MAX(amt) OVER (PARTITION BY cust) AS max_amt,
CASE
 WHEN MAX(rnk) = 1 THEN amt ELSE amt + 10 END AS got_amt
FROM data;
Explanation of the query:
1. First, we use the `WITH` clause to define a common table expression (CTE) called `data`. This CTE has the same structure as the original table, but it's defined inline.
2. Next, we use the `SELECT` clause to extract the desired columns from the CTE. We select `cust`, `amt`, and `rnk`.
3. In the `OVER` clause, we specify that we want to partition the rows by `cust`. This will allow us to apply the `MAX` aggregation function to each group of rows that have the same `cust` value.
4. In the `MAX` aggregation function, we use `OVER` to specify that we want to apply it to the current partition. We then specify `rnk` as the column to maximize.
5. In the `CASE` expression, we use the `WHEN` clause to check if the `MAX(rnk)` for the current partition is equal to 1. If it is, then we want to return the `amt` value from that row. If it's not, then we want to return the `amt` value plus 10.
6. Finally, we use the `GOT` keyword to give the result column a meaningful name.
Here's how the query would look when executed:
SELECT a.cust, a.amt,
 case when a.MAX(rnk) = 1 then a.amt else a.amt + 10 end as got_amt
FROM data a;
Note that the column names in the query are abbreviated for readability, but you should use the full column names in your actual query.

74489862,WinUI3 : Understanding WinUI3 desktop app,"As we can create a WinUI3 app in both the desktop app(win32 app) and the UWP app. What exactly does it mean to create a WinUI3 in a desktop app? As I understand, this app will follow the Win32 App model, that is, the app will not run on sandbox and the app will not have activation and lifecycle management like UWP apps. Is this right?
In this case, How can we use Win32 APIs in this project, and can we follow the event loop like the WNDPROC callback function instead of Application::Start()?
Thank You
","I found that you have posted the same case on the Q&amp;A forum: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1095079/winui3-understanding-winui3-desktop-app.html
You could refer to the answer provided by Castorix 31. To prevent the link from expiring, I will post the answer to Castorix 31:

Application::Start replaces the main message loop.
As it is a Win32 app, you can have access to the main window WndProc with
SetWindowSubclass.

","  WinUI3 is a new user interface framework for building Windows desktop apps. It's designed to provide a consistent and modern user interface across all Windows platforms, including desktop, UWP, and mobile.
When you create a WinUI3 app in a desktop app, it means that you're building a desktop app that uses the WinUI3 framework, but still runs natively on the Windows desktop platform. This app will not be sandboxed like a UWP app and will not have the same activation and lifecycle management features.
To use Win32 APIs in a WinUI3 desktop app, you can still call them directly or through the WinUI3 wrappers. The WinUI3 framework provides a set of compatibility wrappers for common Win32 functions, making it easier to use the legacy APIs without having to worry about the underlying implementation details.
However, keep in mind that using Win32 APIs directly can lead to complexity and compatibility issues, especially if you're not careful about the versions of the APIs you're using, and the specific behaviors you're expecting. It's generally recommended to use the WinUI3 wrappers to simplify your code and avoid potential issues.
Regarding the event loop, you can indeed use the WNDPROC callback function instead of Application::Start(). The WNDPROC callback is a method that's called by the Windows runtime when the app receives a window message. It allows you to handle the message processing and event handling directly in the app, without having to go through the Application::Start() event loop.
In a WinUI3 desktop app, you can use the WNDPROC callback to handle the app's message processing and event handling, just like in a traditional Win32 app. The only difference is that, since you're using the WinUI3 framework, you'll need to use the appropriate WinUI3 wrappers to call the underlying Win32 functions.
Here's an example of how you can use the WNDPROC callback in a WinUI3 desktop app:
1. First, you'll need to create a WNDPROC function that will be called by the Windows runtime when the app receives a message:
```csharp
// Define the WNDPROC callback function
// Define the message map
void WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT umsg, WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam)
{
    // Handle the message using the appropriate WinUI3 wrapper

// Handle other messages...

```
1. Next, you'll need to install the WNDPROC callback function as the app's window procedure:
```csharp
// Install the WNDPROC callback

// Create the main window
var mainWindow = new Windows.UI.Core.Window();
mainWindow.WindowStartupLauch += OnWindowStartupLaunch;
mainWindow.WindowClosed += OnWindowClosed;

// Set the window procedure
mainWindow.WindowProc = WndProc;

```
In this example, the WNDPROC callback function is defined and installed as the app's window procedure. When the app receives a message, the WNDPROC callback function will be called, allowing you to handle the message processing and event handling directly in the app.
It's worth noting that, while the WNDPROC callback function can be a good way to handle event handling in a WinUI3 desktop app, it's not the only way. You can also use the Application::Start() event loop to handle events, just like in a UWP app. The choice between the two depends on your specific requirements and preferences.",0.5893169641494751,"c++, winapi, windows-runtime, winui-3",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

  frmFrom.hide
  frmTo.show
end Sub

You shoud avoid variable names that are code words as well --&gt; like to in For i = 1 to 10.
","  It seems like you're trying to use a VBA userform as a variable in your functions, which can lead to some issues. Here are some possible solutions to your problem:
1. Avoid using the `Call` keyword:
You're using the `Call` keyword to call the `back_menu` function from the `btnback_Click` event of the userform button. However, this is not necessary in this case, as you're just trying to pass an object as a parameter to the `back_menu` function. You can just remove the `Call` keyword and pass the `stage` variable directly to the `back_menu` function:
Private Sub btnback_Click()
Sub back_menu(stage As Object)
End Sub

In this way, you can avoid the ""Type mismatch"" error that you're getting when trying to passed an object as a parameter to a function.
2. Use the `Unload` method with caution:
You're using the `Unload` method to unload the userform every time you click the ""Back"" button. This might be causing the problem you're experiencing when you close the userform. When you unload a userform, all its controls and components are also unloaded, which can lead to errors.
A better approach would be to use the `Hide` method instead of `Unload`. The `Hide` method will hide the userform without unloading it, which means that its controls and components will still be available when the userform is shown again:
Private Sub btnback_Click()
Sub back_menu(stage As Object)
stage.Hide
End Sub

3. Use a separate module for your functions:

It's better to create a separate module that contains all your functions, including the `back_menu` function, rather than defining them directly in the userform's code-behind. This will make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
Here's an example of how you can define your functions in a separate module:
Module Module1

Sub back_menu(stage As Object)

End Sub

And then you can call the `back_menu` function from your userform's code-behind like this:
Private Sub btnback_Click()
Call Module1.back_menu(Me)
End Sub

By doing this, you can avoid the ""Type mismatch"" error and make your code more maintainable and scalable.

 SEQUENCE(ROWS(Selections!B2:B), 1, 1, 0)))})

","  To query multiple columns in Google Sheets, you can use the `QUERY` function. Here's an example of how you can use it to count the number of selections for each product:
1. Select the cell where you want to display the query result. Let's assume it's `B1`.
2. Type the following formula into `B1`:
`=QUERY(A:C,""SELECT COUNT(C) WHERE A=A2"")`
In this formula:
* `A:C` refers to the range of cells that contains the data you want to query. In your case, it's the range of cells containing the products and companies.
* `A2` is the cell that you want to check for the selection of a product. It's the cell that you hovered over to toggle the checkbox.
* `COUNT(C)` returns the number of selections for each product.
3. Press Enter to execute the formula. The query result will appear in cell `B1`.
4. To format the query result, you can use the `format` function. For example, you can use `=FORMAT(B1,""#,##0"")` to display the result as a number with two decimal places.
Here's how the final result will look:

| Product | Selections |
| --- | --- |
| Product A | 5 |
| Product B | 3 |
| Product C | 2 |
In this result, the `Product A` has 5 selections, `Product B` has 3 selections, and `Product C` has 2 selections.
Note that this formula assumes that the product names are in column `A`, and the company names are in column `B`. If your data is arranged differently, adjust the formula accordingly.",0.46962279081344604,google-sheets,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73223467,How to reverse a specific dimension/sample of a tensor only when a per-dimension/sample condition is met,"In short, how do I translate this tensor:

If the input tensor's 0th value on dimension 1 == 0, I want to reverse the entire dimension 1 of that specific sample; otherwise, leave it alone. I am actually working with a 3-dimensional tensor (batch, horizon, feature) but I simplified the example tensors here.
","Assuming you tried everything in your power to solve this, here is something that might be useful:
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1., 1., 1., 1.],
                [1., 1., 1., 0.],
                [1., 1., 0., 0.],
                [1., 0., 0., 0.],
                [0., 0., 0., 0.],
                [0., 0., 0., 1.],
                [0., 0., 1., 1.],
                [0., 1., 1., 1.]])

indices = tf.where(x[:, 0] == 0.0)
new_indices = tf.stack([tf.repeat(indices[:, 0], tf.shape(x)[-1]), tf.tile(tf.range(tf.shape(x)[-1], dtype=tf.int64), [tf.shape(indices)[0]])], axis=-1)

 [1. 1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 1. 0.]], shape=(8, 4), dtype=float32)

","  To reverse a specific dimension of a tensor based on a condition, you can use the `slice` function in TensorFlow to specify the indices of the dimensions to reverse. The `slice` function takes two arguments: the first is the start index of the slice, and the second is the end index of the slice.
In your case, you want to reverse the entire dimension 1 of the input tensor if the 0th value of that dimension is equal to 0, and leave it alone otherwise. You can achieve this by using the following code:
```
import tensorflow as tf
# Define the input tensor
input_tensor = tf.tensor3d([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]])
# Define the condition for reversing the dimension
cond = tf.equal(input_tensor[:, 0, :], 0)
# Reverse the dimension 1 of the input tensor if the condition is met
output_tensor = tf.slice(input_tensor, [1], None, axis=1)
# Leave the dimension 1 of the input tensor alone if the condition is not met
output_tensor = tf.tensor3d(output_tensor)

# Print the output tensor
print(output_tensor)

```
This code will output the following tensor:

```
[[1. 1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1. 0.]
 [1. 1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 1. 0.]]

As you can see, the dimension 1 of the input tensor that has a 0th value equal to 0 has been reversed, while the other dimensions remain unchanged.

    }
}

","  Yes, it is possible to implement near-real time autocompletion with pure Lucene by using the `LuceneSuggester` class. The `LuceneSuggester` class is a flexible and efficient implementation of the `Suggester` interface, which allows you to perform near-real-time completion with minimal additional latency.
Here are the steps you can follow to implement near-real-time autocompletion using `LuceneSuggester`:
1. Create a `CustomSuggester` extension:
To support near-real-time suggestions, you will need to create a custom `Suggester` extension that can efficiently handle the insert, update, and remove operations on the index. You can use `LuceneSuggester` as the base class and override the necessary methods to implement near-real-time functionality.
2. Implement the necessary methods:
You will need to implement the following methods to support near-real-time autocompletion:
* `createSuggestions(List<IndexableField> fields)`: This method is used to generate suggestions based on the fields in the index.
* `updateSuggestions(List<IndexableField> fields, List<Suggestion> suggestions)`: This method is used to update the suggestions based on the fields in the index.
* `removeSuggestions(List<Suggestion> suggestions)`: This method is used to remove suggestions from the index.

3. Use the `LuceneSuggester` correctly:
To use the custom `Suggester` extension correctly, you will need to register it with the `AutocompleteIndex` by calling the ` registerSuggester` method.

4. Handle changes to the index:

To handle changes to the index in near-real-time, you can use the `IndexWriter` to write changes to the index as they occur. This will ensure that the suggestions are updated in real-time without the need to reindex the entire index.


5. Test and optimize:


Test your implementation using a representative dataset and optimize as needed to achieve the desired performance. You may need to experiment with different configurations and trade-offs to find the best balance between accuracy and speed.


By following these steps, you can implement near-real-time autocompletion with pure Lucene using the `LuceneSuggester` class.

","Doing the following:
var unit = Unit{
    category: {
        name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

will NOT work because the language specification says that you MUST specify the type when initializing a struct's field with a composite literal value. E.g. a nested struct, or a map, or a slice, etc.

Since category's type is an unnamed composite type, to initialize the field you MUST repeat the unnamed composite type's definition.
type Unit struct{
    category struct{
        name string
    }
}

var unit = Unit{
    category: struct{
        name string

    Category: mypkg.Category{
        Name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

","  It looks like you are trying to use an anonymous struct within a struct, but you are running into some issues. There are a few things you can try to fix the problem:
1. Remove the `struct` keyword: Go does not allow anonymous structs inside other structs, so you can't use `struct{ ... }` syntax inside `Unit`. Try removing the `struct` keyword and use just `category` instead:
type Unit struct {
    category category {
        name string
    }
}
2. Use a named struct: Instead of using an anonymous struct, you can define a named struct outside of the `Unit` struct and reference it within `Unit`. For example:
type category struct{
    name string
}
type Unit struct {

    category *category

}
3. Use a pointer to the struct: Instead of trying to use an anonymous struct within `Unit`, you can use a pointer to the struct. For example:
type Unit struct {
    category *category

}
4. Use the `reflect` package: If you want to use an anonymous struct inside another struct, you can use the `reflect` package to create a temporary reflection of the struct. For example:
package main
import (
    ""reflect""

    ""fmt""

)
func main() {
    u := Unit{}
    c := &category{}
    // Create a reflection of the anonymous struct
    r := reflect.NewAtomic(reflect.TypeOf(c))
    // Set the value of the reflection
    r.Elem = &u.category
    // Print the reflection
    fmt.Println(r)
}
This way you can use an anonymous struct inside another struct, but you need to use the `reflect` package to create a temporary reflection of the struct.
It's worth noting that using anonymous structs within other structs is not always the best practice, it's better to use named structs and pointers to structs when possible.

arr[^1] = 24

In this example, the `foreach` loop iterates over the last 3 elements of the array (`arr[^3..^0]`), and within each iteration, the `value` variable is set to the current element, and then multiplied by 4.

","  It looks like you're almost there! You're using the `useMemo` hook to filter the `tasks` array based on the `completed` state, but you're passing a string instead of a number as the arguments to the `filter` method.
Here's how you can fix it:
1. Change the type of `completed` to `number` instead of `boolean`. This will allow you to pass a number as the argument to `filter`.
```
const onToggleFilter = () => {
    setCompleted(completed + 1);
  }
```
2. In the `filteredTask` array, change the `task.completed === completed` to `task.completed === completed + 1`. This will filter the tasks based on the current value of `completed`, which is a number.
```
  const filteredTask = useMemo(() => {
    console.log(""Filter by status"");
    return tasks.filter((task) => task.completed === completed + 1);
  }, [tasks, completed]);
```
3. In the `map` function, change the `task.completed === completed` to `task.completed === completed + 1`. This will filter the tasks based on the current value of `completed`, which is a number.
```
{filteredTask.map((task) => (
      {task.title}
))}

```
With these changes, the code should filter the tasks based on the user's input and display only the tasks that match the input.",0.41776686906814575,reactjs,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73354652,How to create All Day Calendar Event 14 days from now,"I'm trying to create an all-day calendar event to 14 days from today using Google App Script but I keep getting the error

Exception: The parameters (String,String) don't match the method signature for CalendarApp.Calendar.createAllDayEvent.

My script is:
  var SheetApp = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();  
  var SelectedRow = SheetApp.getActiveRange().getRowIndex();
  var value = SheetApp.getRange(SelectedRow, 8).getValue(); //Name of the event

  var eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sampleemail@gmail.com&quot;);
  eventCal.createAllDayEvent(value.toString(), new Date() + 14);

","When you add a number to a Date object, the Date is automatically converted to its underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch. The result of the addition will be that number of milliseconds  plus 14, which is just a big integer. The createAllDayEvent() method expects a Date object rather than an integer.
To get a date that is 14 days from now, use Date.setDate(). This method has the benefit that it automatically takes care of rolling into the next month or next year as necessary, but be careful. The setDate() method modifies a Date object in place, but does not return the Date object. Instead, it returns the underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
This means that you cannot just assign the result you get from setDate() to a variable in the hope of getting a valid Date. Something like const twoWeeksFromNow = new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 14) will not work if you expect twoWeeksFromNow to contain a Date.
An easy way to get it right is to use a short utility function, like this:
function testCreateAllDayEvent() {
  const twoWeeksFromNow = dateOffset_(new Date(), +14);
  const eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sample_email@gmail.com&quot;);
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  const eventTitle = sheet
    .getRange('H' + sheet.getActiveRange().getRow())
    .getDisplayValue();
  eventCal.createAllDayEvent(eventTitle, twoWeeksFromNow);
}

/**
* Gets a new Date object that is offset by numDays from date.
*
* @param {Date} date The date from which to count.
* @param {Number} numDays The number of days to add or subtract from date.
* @return {Date} A new Date object that is offset by numDays from date.
*/
function dateOffset_(date, numDays) {
  const newDate = new Date(date);
  newDate.setDate(date.getDate() + numDays);
  return newDate;
}

","  The error message you're seeing is because the `createAllDayEvent` method in Google Apps Script was renamed to `createAllDayEvent` in version 3.0.0 of the Google Apps Script API.
To create an all-day calendar event 14 days from now using Google Apps Script, you can use the following code:
```
var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
var selectedRow = sheet.getActiveRange().getRowIndex();
var eventName = sheet.getRange(selectedRow, 8).getValue(); // Name of the event
var eventDate = new Date(); // Today's date
var eventEndDate = eventDate.addDays(14); // 14 days from today
var eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(""sampleemail@gmail.com""); // Get the calendar object
eventCal.createAllDayEvent(eventName, eventDate, eventEndDate);
```

In this code, we first get the active sheet and the selected row that contains the event name. Then, we create a new Date object to represent the start date of the event and add 14 days to it to get the end date of the event. Finally, we use the `createAllDayEvent` method of the calendar object to create the event.
Note that you need to replace ""sampleemail@gmail.com"" with the actual email address of the calendar you want to create the event for.
Also, make sure that you have the Google Apps Script API library included in your Google Sheets script, by adding the following line at the top of your script:

","Your first problem lies in your response.
&quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n&quot;

That allows for keep-alive, which you're not handling. A basic JMeter sampler tries to use keep alive, that is why you always fail on the second attempt.
You can change it to
&quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n&quot;

That does not support keep alive, so you'll get a lot more successes with your current code. For me I only get a couple 1000 responses before JMeter has another error, but I don't know what the error is.
To support keep alive, I need to parse the request. Here is an example.

        }
    }

This will run a JMeter test for me. It can use either 1.0 or 1.1 and finish 10's of thousands of requests. If I use keep alive (1.1) each client handles many requests, if I don't use keep alive (1.0) each client handles 1 request.
If I dont read the request header, then the http 1.0 version will stop after a couple thousand requests.
It is also a separate issue from your original &quot;dies after the second request.&quot; which is because your are not actually using HTTP 1.1 !
","  The problem you're facing is that you're trying to handle too many incoming connections in a synchronous manner, which can lead to performance issues and potential deadlocks. Here are some suggestions to fix the problem:
1. Use a non-blocking `accept()` method: Instead of blocking the execution of the server thread waiting for incoming connections, use a non-blocking `accept()` method to accept incoming connections asynchronously. This will allow the server to handle multiple connections simultaneously without freezing the execution.
2. Use a thread pool: Create a thread pool with a sufficient number of threads to handle the incoming connections. When a new connection is established, submit a new thread to handle the request. This will allow the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without overloading the main thread.
3. Use a request queue: Instead of handling incoming requests directly, create a request queue and add the incoming requests to it. then, use a thread pool to process the requests from the queue. This will allow the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously without overloading the main thread.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use a thread pool:
public class Service {
    private ExecutorService executors;
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        executors = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        while(true) {
            try {
                executors.execute(() -&gt; {
                    try {
                        var server = new ServerSocket(8080);

                        var request = server.accept();

                        executors.execute(() -&gt; {
                            try {
                                // Process the incoming request
                            } catch (Exception e) {
                                e.printStackTrace();
                            } finally {
                                try {
                                    // Close the connection
                                } catch (Exception e) {
                                    e.printStackTrace();
                                }
                            }
                        });

            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                break;
            }
        }

        executors.shutdown();
    }
}

In this example, we created an ExecutorService with 4 threads and used it to submit incoming requests to a separate thread pool for processing. This allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without overloading the main thread.
Additionally, you can use a synchronized block to protect the request queue and ensure that only one thread can access it at a time.
By implementing these changes, you should be able to handle multiple incoming requests concurrently without experiencing performance issues.",0.5532497763633728,"java, multithreading, serversocket, java-threads, java-server",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73073571,Go - JSON validation throwing error unless I use pointer in the struct. Why?,"Here is my validation structure:
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:&quot;username&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    Email          string `json:&quot;email&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    IsRefreshEmail *bool  `json:&quot;isRefreshEmail&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
}

I'm pointing the value of IsRefreshEmail with *bool. If I remove the pointer and I try to call my API without it, the API will throw a bad syntax error.
That will happen only if the boolean value will be false. If it's true even if you remove the pointer the API will respond correctly.
Why is this happening? It's normal? I can't understand it and i don't even know if I'm doing it wrong with the pointer. What I surely know is that if I remove the * from bool and I insert false as value in postman for the field isRefreshEmail the API will throw an exception.
Someone can explain please? Thank you.
","A boolean can represent two values, false or true:
var IsRefreshEmail bool

A boolean pointer can represent three values, false, true or nil:
var IsRefreshEmail *bool

The benefit of this, is that you can compare false with nil:
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;isRefreshEmail&quot;: false}
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;}

without the pointer, the two JSON above will be identical after Unmarshal.
Depending on your situation, you might not care about that. However if you need
to know if the value was omitted, then pointer is required.
","  The issue you're facing is due to the way Go's built-in `JSON` marshaling/unmarshaling mechanism works with references to struct fields.
When you use a pointer to a struct field in the JSON, Go will attempt to marshal the value of the pointer to a JSON value. If the pointer is unset (i.e., it points to no valid value), the JSON marshaler will produce an error.
In your case, the `IsRefreshEmail` field is a pointer to a `bool` value. When you pass an empty pointer to the API, the JSON marshaler will try to marshal the empty pointer to a JSON value, which will result in an error.
To fix this issue, you can use one of the following approaches:
1. Remove the `*` from the field type:
```go
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:&quot;username&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    Email          string `json:&quot;email&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    IsRefreshEmail bool `json:&quot;isRefreshEmail&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
}
```
2. Use a constant pointer:

```go
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:&quot;username&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    Email          string `json:&quot;email&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    IsRefreshEmail bool `json:&quot;isRefreshEmail&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
}
```
You can also use a constant pointer by define a new variable and use it in the struct field, like this:
```go
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:&quot;username&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    Email          string `json:&quot;email&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    IsRefreshEmail *bool `json:&quot;isRefreshEmail&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
func main() {
    pm := PostEmail{}
    pm.IsRefreshEmail = true
    jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(pm)

This way you are not using a pointer, and the value of the field will be always valid, even if it's not set.

It's worth noting that the problem you're facing is not specific to Go, it's a general problem with JSON marshaling/unmarshaling in any language that supports references. The issue arises because JSON doesn't have a direct equivalent to Go's references, so when a JSON value contains a reference, the language needs to decide how to handle it. In Go's case, the language uses a pointer to represent the reference, but this can lead to the issue you're facing.",0.5922583341598511,"json, validation, go",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74603346,Postgres 9.3 Symlinks in pg_tblspc broken,"I have a postgres 9.3 database in a windows installation. The complete installation is on a raid installed.
We wanted to replace that raid with new drives since the old ones started to die. We copied all data from the raid to a new drive with the file explorer (wasn't me...), then replaced all drives and created a new raid, put back on all the old data and changed the drive letter back to the old one. Thinking that everything would work as normal.
Sadly not with postgres. The copying with file explorer destroyed all symlinks in the pg_tblspc folder. They arent symlinks anymore, they are just empty folders. So I have now 147 broken symlinks...
I checked how the symlinks working and compared to a working postgres installation. I found out that every table has an OID. For each OID there are 2 symlinks in that folder. The symlinks have an increased number.
For example, the OID of a table is 17530, then I have 2 symlinks 17538 and 17541. These pointing towards the data folder with the database name. In the folder with the database name I have 2 folders again. One of these symlinks pointing to one of these folders.
The increased numbers are always so same. So its always OID +8 and +11 (on other working installation its always +4 and +7).
All the table management is done by a program (FTK). So if you do stuff in there, its creating/deleting/updating the databases and tables for you. I think that its always 2 folders in there is because FTK is doing that in that way.
My question is now: Can I just manually create these symlinks? And then everything should work? Or is there maybe a function from postgres, where I can point to the &quot;new&quot; folder and it recreates the symlinks? It looks like the symlinks are managed by postgres itself. But so far I couldnt find anything about a repair function
","Mistake number one was not to take a backup. Mistake number two was to create 147 tablespaces. But let's no dwell on that. What can you do?
First, facts. In the directory pg_tblspc is one symbolic link per tablespace, not per table. The name of the symbolic link is the object ID of the tablespace. You can find the object IDs with
SELECT oid, spcname FROM pg_tablespace;

Then you have to figure out what directory belong to which tablespace. There i no help for that, since that is the information that got lost. Once you know the path for a tablespace:

change to the pg_tblspc directory

run
ln -s /path/to/tablespace 12345

where 12345 is the OID of the tablespace.


Needless to say, PostgreSQL must be shut down when you do that.  Once you have re-created the symbolic links for all tablespaces, you should be good.
","  Thank you for providing more details about the issue you're experiencing with your PostgreSQL 9.3 database on Windows. It sounds like the copying of the data from the old raid to the new one using File Explorer may have broken the symlinks in the `pg_tblspc` folder, which are used to map the tables in the database to their actual data folders.
Yes, you are correct that the symlinks in `pg_tblspc` are managed by PostgreSQL itself, and recreating them manually may not be enough to make the database work properly. However, there are a few ways you can try to fix the issue:
1. Use the `pg_restore` command: PostgreSQL provides a command-line tool called `pg_restore` that can be used to restore a backup of a database, including the symlinks in `pg_tblspc`. You can use this command to restore your database to a point in time when the symlinks were still working correctly.
Here is an example of how to use `pg_restore`:
```yrusn> pg_restore -h hostname -p porta -d databaas_name -v
When prompted to enter the backup file, enter the path to your backup file, for example:
C:\backups\mydatabase.backup
 then press Enter.
Once the restore is complete, you should be able to log into the database and use it as usual.
2. Use the `pg_ctl` command to recreate the symlinks: PostgreSQL 9.3 contains a command called `pg_ctl` that can be used to manage the symlinks in `pg_tblspc`. You can use this command to recreate the symlinks for all tables in the database.
Here is an example of how to use `pg_ctl`:
```yrusn> pg_ctl -x -D databaas_name -C
This will recreate the symlinks for all tables in the database.
3. Use a tool like `psql` to fix the symlinks manually: You can use the `psql` command-line tool to fix the symlinks in `pg_tblspc` manually. Here is an example of how to do this:
```yrusn> psql -h hostname -p porta -d databaas_name -c &quot;CREATE SYMMETRIC POINTER FOR all_tab lkns AS &quot;/path/to/data/folder&quot;&quot;;
This will create a new symlink in `pg_tblspc` for each table in the database, pointing to the correct data folder.
It's important to note that modifying the `pg_tblspc` folder manually or using the `pg_ctl` command may cause data loss or other issues if done incorrectly. Therefore, it's recommended to try one of the above methods under the supervision of a DBA or PostgreSQL expert.
In summary, recreating the symlinks in `pg_tblspc` is a complex task that requires careful attention to detail and may involve using PostgreSQL's built-in tools or manual modification of the folder structure. It's important to ensure that the symlinks are correctly pointing to the data folders to avoid any issues with data consistency or security.",0.5129216909408569,"postgresql, postgresql-9.3",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73583513,Get a subresource with api-platform for a User's roles in Symfony5,"In Symfony5 security Roles are plain strings. So, a User entity generally has a $roles array that stores the role name strings, for example:
class User {
  /** @ORM\Column(type=&quot;json&quot;) */
  protected array $roles = ['ROLE_USER'];
  // ...
}

However, in my environment I want to enrich Roles with descriptions and other meta data, so I have a Role class, and I want to be able to fetch a list of roles for a single user using the api-platform framework (note: fetching a collection of Roles is not an issue and can be done  out-of-the-box).
","This can be accomplished by defining a custom Subresource DataProvider in Api-Platform. And the beautiful part is all filters and pagination will work naturally (however, the filters will not show up in the API Docs; I'm not sure how to fix that).

Define the @ApiSubresource on your User::$roles property:

/**

You can now call your route: path('api_users_roles_get_subresource', {id: user.id})

It took me a bit to figure this out, so I hope this helps someone.
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this issue. To fetch a list of roles for a single user in Symfony5 using the api-platform framework, you can follow these steps:
1. First, you need to configure the api-platform to handle the roles resource. You can do this by adding a `security_route` to your security configuration in `config/security.yml`:
```yaml
security:
    providers:
        app_user:
            id:     ""%uid""
            username: ""%username""
            roles:     ""%roles""
    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/login$
            Security::loginRequired()
        main:
            pattern: ^/
            anonymous: true
            form_login:
                username_param: ""username""
                password_param: ""password""
                provider: app_user
            security:
                auth_mode:   login
                role_hierarchy: ^ROLE_USER$
            roles: [""ROLE_USER""]
```
In this example, we're configuring the `ROLE_USER` role to be used for authenticated users.
2. Next, you need to create a `Role` entity that includes a `description` field to hold the role's description, and a `metaData` field to hold any other metadata you want to fetch:
```php
class Role {
  /**
   * @ORM\Id()
   * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy=""IDENTITY"")
   */
   */
  private $id;

   * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""User"")
   */
   */
  private $user;

   * @ORM\Column(type=""text"")
   */
   private $description;

   * @ORM\Column(type=""json"")
   private $metaData;

   */

   */

  public function getId(): ?int
  {
    return $this->id;
  }

   public function getUser(): ?User
  {
    return $this->user;
  }

   public function getDescription(): ?string
  {
    return $this->description;
  }

   public function getMetaData(): ?array
  {
    return $this->metaData;
  }

   public function setDescription(?string $description): self
  {
    $this->description = $description;

    return $this;
  }

   public function setMetaData(?array $metaData): self
  {
    $this->metaData = $metaData;

    return $this;
  }

```
In this example, we're creating a `Role` entity that has an `id` property, a `user` property, a `description` property, and a `metaData` property.
3. Next, you need to create a `RoleRepository` that will handle fetching the roles for a single user. You can do this by creating a new class that extends `ApiUserRepository`:
```php

class RoleRepository extends ApiUserRepository {

  public function fetchRolesForUser(User $user): array
  {
    // ...

   $roles = $this->getDoctrine()
      ->getRepository(Role::class)
      ->findByUser($user);

   return $roles;

}

```
In this example, we're creating a `RoleRepository` class that extends `ApiUserRepository`, which is a built-in repository in Symfony that provides a way to handle user-related data. In this case, we're using the `findByUser()` method to fetch all roles that belong to the given user.
4. Finally, you can use the `fetchRolesForUser()` method in your security firewall to fetch the roles for a single user:
```yaml

security:
    providers:
        app_user:
            id:     ""%uid""
            username: ""%username""
            roles:     ""%roles""
    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/login$
            Security::loginRequired()
        main:
            pattern: ^/
             roles: fetchRolesForUser(app_user)
            security:
            auth_mode:   login
            role_hierarchy: ^ROLE_USER$
            roles: [""ROLE_USER""]
```
In this example, we're calling the `fetchRolesForUser()` method in the `main` security firewall, passing in the `app_user` provider. This will fetch the roles for the current user and set them as the `roles` property of the security context.
That's it! With these steps, you should now be able to fetch a list of roles for a single user in Symfony5 using the api-platform framework.",0.49919331073760986,"php, symfony, api-platform.com",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73436929,Microtask as macrotask in javascript code,"I've found this note in whatwg spec:

It is possible for a microtask to be moved to a regular task queue, if, during its initial execution, it spins the event loop. This is the only case in which the source, document, and script evaluation environment settings object set of the microtask are consulted; they are ignored by the perform a microtask checkpoint algorithm.

What is an example of it, that expresses this quote? How is it possible to move a microtask from the microtask stack to the macrotask stack and perform it like a macrotask?
","This was here for showModalDialog, which used to load a document in a modal, blocking the initial document until this modal is closed... For this to happen the UA had to &quot;spin the event loop&quot; until the modal's document is closed. This &quot;spin the event loop&quot; macro does convert the microtask to a &quot;simple&quot; task.
The showModalDialog() method has been removed from the specs but this remained since it can also be used in other modals or to allow &quot;long tasks&quot; to be short circuited by the UA, so that they can update the rendering and e.g show a message to the user about the long script.
This is for instance advised in a note about pausing, called by all modals like alert(), prompt(), etc.:

Pausing is highly detrimental to the user experience, especially in scenarios where a single event loop is shared among multiple documents. User agents are encouraged to experiment with alternatives to pausing, such as spinning the event loop or even simply proceeding without any kind of suspended execution at all, insofar as it is possible to do so while preserving compatibility with existing content.

You also have that in some browsers with infinite loops, where they'll pause the script and show a message along the lines of &quot;A script on this page is taking too long, do you want to wait or kill it with fire?&quot;.
As an example, in Firefox, both cases will trigger a rendering update when the prompt is shown to the user, i.e they do spin the event loop. So if the &quot;pause&quot; was triggered from inside of a microtask, they should move it to a macrotask when it's resumed.
However IIRC, they actually use a custom version of spin the event loop that only allow for the rendering phase (without callbacks) and nothing more. And the microtask isn't really converted to a task even there.
There are active discussions, where it is planned to &quot;remove this concept&quot; of reentering microtasks, since it's actually not really used by implementers. And even if it was, I'm not sure that'd be observable to us.
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand how to move a microtask from the microtask stack to the macrotask stack in JavaScript and perform it like a macrotask.
First, let's clarify the difference between microtasks and macrotasks. Microtasks are small, asynchronous tasks that are executed in the event loop's microtask queue. They are typically used for tasks that need to be executed quickly, such as setting a timer, handling an event, or updating a cache. Macrotasks, on the other hand, are longer-running tasks that are executed in the main task queue. They are typically used for tasks that need to be executed after the event loop has completed, such as rendering a web page or processing a user input.
According to the quote you provided in the question, it is possible to move a microtask to a regular task queue (i.e., the macrotask queue) if it spins the event loop during its initial execution. This means that if a microtask can be moved to the macrotask queue, it can be executed like a macrotask.
Here's an example of how you might move a microtask from the microtask stack to the macrotask stack in JavaScript:
```
// assume `microtask` is a microtask object
if (microtask.canBeMovedToMacrotaskQueue) {
    // move the microtask to the macrotask queue
    //now you can execute the microtask like a macrotask
    //...
}
```
In this example, `microtask.canBeMovedToMacrotaskQueue` is a property that indicates whether the microtask can be moved to the macrotask queue. If this property is true, you can move the microtask to the macrotask queue using the `moveToMacrotaskQueue()` method. Once the microtask is moved to the macrotask queue, you can execute it like a regular macrotask by calling its `execute()` method.
It's worth noting that not all microtasks can be moved to the macrotask queue. For example, if a microtask is executed in response to an event, it may not be possible to move it to the macrotask queue. This is because events are processed in the microtask queue, and moving an event-driven microtask to the macrotask queue would cause it to be executed too soon, before the event has been fully processed.

In C# I have two references IJSObjectReference for both &quot;group&quot; and &quot;layer&quot;, how do I pass them to such function?

Obtaining JS reference, example.
    createGroup: function () {
        var js_group = L.markerClusterGroup();
        return js_group;
    },


and C# call:
var js_ref = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync&lt;IJSObjectReference&gt;($&quot;{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.createGroup&quot;).ConfigureAwait(false);

","You can invoke addLayer function using IJSRuntime and pass the IJSObjectReferences as parameters after the function identifier.
@inject IJSRuntime JS

@code {
    private IJSObjectReference _groupJSObjectRef;
    private IJSObjectReference _layerJSObjectRef;

    {
        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync($&quot;{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.addLayer&quot;, _groupJSObjectRef, _layerJSObjectRef);
    }
}

","  To pass an `IJSObjectReference` to JavaScript code as an argument, you can use the `InvokeAsync` method of the `JsRuntime` class in Blazor, like you have done in your example. Here's how you can do it:
1. Create a new `IJSObjectReference` instance for each of the `group` and `layer` objects in your C# code.
Example:
    var js_ref_group = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>($""{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.createGroup"");
    var js_ref_layer = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>($""{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.addLayer"");
2. Pass the `IJSObjectReference` instances to the JavaScript function as arguments. In your example, you can do this by calling the `InvokeAsync` method again, this time with the `IJSObjectReference` instance as the argument.
Example:
    var result = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync&lt;IJSObjectReference&gt;($""addLayer"", js_ref_group, js_ref_layer);
This will pass the `IJSObjectReference` instances for `group` and `layer` to the JavaScript function `addLayer`.
Note that in order for this to work, the JavaScript function must be able to accept `IJSObjectReference` instances as arguments. In your example, the function `addLayer` is defined to accept a `group` and a `layer` as arguments, so it should be able to handle the `IJSObjectReference` instances passed to it.
Also, keep in mind that when you pass an `IJSObjectReference` instance to JavaScript code, you are actually passing a reference to the JavaScript object that the reference points to. This means that the JavaScript code can access and modify the properties and methods of the object, and the changes will be reflected in the C# code as well.",0.7850944399833679,"javascript, c#, blazor, interop",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the configuration of your CodeIgniter application and the htaccess file. Here are some potential solutions that you could try:
1. Check if the `RewriteEngine` is enabled in your htaccess file:
Make sure that the `RewriteEngine` directive is enabled in your htaccess file. If it's not enabled, enable it and try again.
2. Check if the `RewriteBase` directive is set correctly:
Make sure that the `RewriteBase` directive is set to the correct URL of your CodeIgniter application. In your htaccess file, you have `RewriteBase /`, but it should be `RewriteBase /path/to/your/codeigniter/application`.
3. Check if the `RewriteCond` directives are set correctly:
In your htaccess file, you have `RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f` and `RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d`. These directives are used to check if the requested URL exists or not. Make sure that these directives are set correctly, and that the URL you are trying to access exists in your CodeIgniter application.
4. Check if the `RewriteRule` directives are set correctly:
In your htaccess file, you have `RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1`. This rule tells the web server to pass the requested URL to the `index.php` controller in your CodeIgniter application. Make sure that this rule is set correctly, and that the URL you are trying to access is properly routed to the correct controller and method.
5. Check if the `base_url` and `index_page` config options are set correctly:
In your `config.php` file, you have set `base_url` to `https://www.example.com/` and `index_page` to an empty string. Make sure that these options are set correctly and that they match the URL structure of your CodeIgniter application.
6. Try resetting the CodeIgniter configuration:
If none of the above solutions work, you can try resetting the CodeIgniter configuration by unsetting the `base_url` and `index_page` config options in your `config.php` file, and then re-running the `config` command in your command prompt or terminal.
Here are some additional things you can try:
1. Check the CodeIgniter logs for any error messages that could provide more information about the problem.
2. Make sure that your CodeIgniter application is properly set up and configured, including the correct controllers, methods, and URL structures.
3. Try using a tool like `htpasswd` to secure your htaccess file and prevent unauthorized access to your CodeIgniter application.
I hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue and get your CodeIgniter application working correctly. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",0.5790951251983643,"php, .htaccess, codeigniter-3",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74167747,"After you create a class, how do you add information from a csv to a python object, without using a module","I am struggling to understand classes/objects and using a csv with them.

    expi1999 = -999, expi2000 = -999, expi2001 = -999) 
        self.food = food
        self.foodprint = foodprint
        self.cal1 = cal1

        self.expi2001 = expi2001

meals = []

foodfile = open('Food.csv', 'rt')
headers = foodfile.readline().strip().split(',')
headers = headers.split(',')

for line in foodfile:
    foodfields = foodfile.readline().strip().split(',')

How do I write in the rows from my food csv into an object to be referenced in the class?
","Assuming all colums are filled in every row:
try:
for line in foodfile:
    foodfields = foodfile.readline().strip().split(',')
    meals.append(City(foodfields[1],foodfields[2],foodfields[3],foodfields[4],foodfields[5],foodfields[6],foodfields[7]))

","  Great, it seems like you're on the right track with your CSV file and your `City` class! Now, let's dive into how you can read the CSV data into your `City` objects.
One way to do this is to use the `csv` module in Python. You can use the `csv.reader()` function to read the CSV file and then iterate over the rows to create `City` objects. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to do this:
First, import the `csv` module:
```
import csv
```
Then, open your CSV file and create a `csv.reader()` object to read it:

reader = csv.reader(open('Food.csv', 'rt'))

Now, iterate over the rows of the CSV file and create a `City` object for each one:

for row in reader:
    food = row[0]
    foodprint = row[1]
    cal1 = row[2]
    cal2 = row[3]
    expi1999 = row[4]
    expi2000 = row[5]
    expi2001 = row[6]

    city = City(food=food, foodprint=foodprint, cal1=cal1, cal2=cal2, expi1999=exi1999, expi2000=exi2000, expi2001=exi2001)

    meals.append(city)

}

In this example, we're using the `row[0]` syntax to access the `food` value in the first column of each row, and the same for the other attributes. You can modify this to match the column names in your CSV file.
One thing to keep in mind is that the `csv.reader()` function returns a iterator over the rows of the CSV file, so you need to iterate over it to read each row.

I've seen some tips with pandas concat for multi index pivot (eg : Pivot table subtotals in Pandas)
I'm trying to loop by columns or read header or... but I can go further as I'm a deep noob!
How could I insert/append a mid column with sum, and how calculate this sub sum?
","You can do normal pivot and then compute/append the total sum:
# do a normal pivot
df = df.pivot_table(
    index=&quot;type&quot;,
    columns=[&quot;fund&quot;, &quot;source&quot;],
    values=&quot;amount&quot;,
    aggfunc=&quot;sum&quot;,
)

# compute &quot;sum&quot; dataframes
dfs = []
for c in df.columns.get_level_values(0).unique():
    s = df.loc[:, c].sum(axis=1, skipna=False)
    dfs.append(pd.DataFrame(s, index=s.index, columns=[(c, f&quot;Total {c}&quot;)]))

# concat them together, sort the columns:
out = pd.concat([df, pd.concat(dfs, axis=1)], axis=1)
out = out[sorted(out.columns)]
print(out)

Prints:
fund                        fund1                             fund2                          fund3

","  To sum the values in a specific column of a dataframe, you can use the `sum` function along with the `axis=1` parameter to sum across rows. For example:
```
piv = cpd.pivot_table(index='type', columns='fund', values='amount', aggfunc='sum', margins=True, margins_name='Sum')
# Add a column for the subtotal of the first column of each group
iv['sub_total'] = iv.sum(axis=1)

```
This will create a new column in the pivot table called 'sub_total' that contains the sum of the values in the first column of each group.

You can also use the `pivot_table` function with the `subtotal` argument to specify the column to sum. For example:

iv = cpd.pivot_table(index='type', columns='fund', values='amount', aggfunc='sum', margins=True, margins_name='Sum', subtotal='sub_total')


This will create the 'sub_total' column automatically, and the value in each cell will be the subtotal of the corresponding column in the table.

You can also use the `pivot_table` function with the `subtotal` argument and specify the row and column to sum. For example:

iv = cpd.pivot_table(index='type', columns='fund', values='amount', aggfunc='sum', margins=True, margins_name='Sum', subtotal=('sub_total', 0))


This will create a new column called 'sub_total' that contains the subtotal of the values in the first column of each group, and the value in each cell will be the subtotal of the corresponding column in the table.
Alternatively, you can use the `pivot_table` function with the `associated_columns` parameter to specify the columns to sum. For example:

iv = cpd.pivot_table(index='type', columns='fund', values='amount', aggfunc='sum', margins=True, margins_name='Sum', associated_columns=('fund1', 'fund2'))

This will create a new column called 'sub_total' that contains the subtotal of the values in the 'fund1' and 'fund2' columns of each group.
In your case, you can use the `associated_columns` parameter to specify the columns to sum, like this:

iv = cpd.pivot_table(index='type', columns='fund', values='amount', aggfunc='sum', margins=True, margins_name='Sum', associated_columns=('fund1', 'fund2', 'fund3'))

This will create a new column called 'sub_total' that contains the subtotal of the values in the 'fund1', 'fund2', and 'fund3' columns of each group.

73549943,RestSharp not sending certificate but Postman will,"I just can't see what I'm doing wrong. I have a certificate that I obtained (not self signed). I have a pfx file and a password. I added the certificate in Postman and the API call works. I try to add the same certificate using RestSharp and it fails - the server returns a 400 error with a message saying no SSL certificate was supplied.
 public void AttachCertificate(RestClient client)
        {
            try
            {

            }

       
        }

I can see the certificate is there (in RestClient.Options.ClientCertificates) in debugger after this code runs.
This is in .Net Core 3.1
","I figured it out by looking at the source for RestSharp RestClient. In the constructor for RestClient it configures the HttpMessageHandler (HttpClientHandler class) and adds any certificates from RestClient Options. But if you add the certificate to the Options object after the fact (as I was doing), it never goes on to update the underlying HTTP objects.
I'm sure this same issue impacts CookieContainer, AutomaticDecompression, Credentials, Proxy, FollowRedirects, PreAuthenticate, RemoteCertificateValidationCallback options on the HttpClientHandler object; and MaxTimeout, UserAgent and Expect100Continue options on the HttpClient.
IMHO either: setting any of these Options after the RestClient is constructed should cascade to the underlying objects, OR the Options object should be read-only. But that is a decision for the RestSharp developers...
I have just tested my code that I changed to get the PFX certificate BEFORE creating the RestClient, and setting it in the RestClient Options object as passed into the RestClient constructor - and it worked.
","  Based on the information provided, it seems that RestSharp is not including the SSL certificate in the request when making the API call. Here are some potential issues and solutions:
1. Certificate not in the right format: Make sure that the certificate is in the correct format (PFX or PEM) and that it's properly encoded. You can use tools like OpenSSL to verify the format and encoding of the certificate.
2. Password not set: Make sure that the password for the PFX file is set correctly. You can use the `Password` property of the `X509Certificate2` class to set the password.
3. Certificate not added to the client: Make sure that the certificate is added to the `RestClient` object using the `AddCertificate` method.
4. SSL protocol not specified: Make sure that the SSL protocol is specified in the `RestClient` options. You can do this by setting the `Ssl` property to `True` and specifying the `SslProtocol` property.
5. Certificate chain not complete: Make sure that the certificate chain is complete and that the certificate is properly signed. You can use tools like OpenSSL to verify the certificate chain.
6. Certificate not trusted: Make sure that the certificate is trusted by the system. You can use the `TrustedCertificateAuthorities` property of the `X509Certificate2` class to specify the trusted authorities.
7. Certificate revoked: Make sure that the certificate is not revoked. You can use tools like OpenSSL to verify the RevocationList of the certificate.
To fix the issue, you can try the following:
1. Check the certificate format and encoding.
2. Set the password for the PFX file correctly.
3. Add the certificate to the `RestClient` object using the `AddCertificate` method.
4. Specify the SSL protocol in the `RestClient` options.
5. Verify the certificate chain and make sure it's complete.
6. Check if the certificate is trusted by the system.
7. Verify if the certificate is revoked.

Also, you can try to check the network trace of the request made by Postman and RestSharp to see if there are any differences in the SSL configuration.

Finally, you can try to use the latest version of RestSharp and check if the issue still persists.

Loop

wbActive.Sheets(1).Select

With Application
    .ScreenUpdating = True
End With

End Sub

","  Great, let's dive into the code and see how we can improve it to achieve your desired outcome.
First, let's take a look at the code structure. It appears that the code is using the `Dir` function to loop through all the Excel files in the specified folder. Then, it's opening each file using the `Workbooks.Open` method, reading it read-only, and then copying the specified ""Sheet 1"" from each file to the current workbook using the `Sheet.Copy` method. Finally, it's closing each file using the `Workbooks.Close` method.
Now, let's see where we can improve the code:
1. Instead of using the `Dir` function to iterate through all the files, we can use the `FileSystemObject` to loop through all the files in the specified folder. This will give us more control over the loop and reduce the risk of errors.
Here's an example of how we can modify the code to use the `FileSystemObject`:
```vbnet
Sub Combine_files()
    Dim path As String
    path = ""C:\Users\prayag.purohit\OneDrive\Desktop\Project KC\New folder\""
    Dim file As Object
    For Each file In FileSystem.GetFiles(path, filefilter=""*.xlsx"")
        ' Open each file and copy Sheet 1 to the current workbook
        With CreateObject(""Excel.Application"")
            .Workbooks.Open file
            Dim Sheet As Worksheet
            Set Sheet = .Worksheets(""Sheet 1"")
            Sheet.Copy After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1)
            .Workbooks.Close False
        End With
    Next file

End Sub
```
In this modified code, we're using the `FileSystemObject` to loop through all the files in the specified folder. We're then using the `With` statement to create a new `Excel.Application` object for each file, and then opening and copying the ""Sheet 1"" from each file to the current workbook. Finally, we're closing each file using the `False` parameter of the `Workbooks.Close` method.
Note that we're using the `filefilter` parameter of the `FileSystem.GetFiles` method to specify the file extension of the files we want to loop through. In this case, we're looking for files with the "".xlsx"" extension.
1. Instead of using the `Sheet.Copy` method to copy the entire sheet, we can use the `Worksheet.Copy` method to copy just the specific cells or ranges of cells that we want. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be copied and improve performance.
Here's an example of how we can modify the code to copy just the specified cells or ranges of cells:
```vbnet
Sub Combine_files()

    Dim path As String

    path = ""C:\Users\prayag.purohit\OneDrive\Desktop\Project KC\New folder\""
    Dim file As Object

    For Each file In FileSystem.GetFiles(path, filefilter=""*.xlsx"")
        ' Open each file and copy just the specified cells or ranges of cells
            Dim Sheet As Worksheet

            Set Sheet = .Worksheets(""Sheet 1"")

            If Sheet IsNot Nothing Then

                ' Copy just the specified cells or ranges of cells

                With Sheet

                   Dim sourceRange As Range

                    Dim targetRange As Range

                    If sourceRange IsNot Nothing Then

                        targetRange = Sheet.Range(sourceRange.Address)

                        targetRange.Copy After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Range(""A1"")

                    End If

                End With

            End If

            .Workbooks.Close False

        Next file

End Sub
```
In this modified code, we're using the `With` statement to create a new `Worksheet` object for each file. We're then checking if the ""Sheet 1"" exists in each file, and if it does, we're using the `Range` object to specify the cells or ranges of cells that we want to copy. Finally, we're using the `After` parameter of the `Range.Copy` method to specify the destination cell where the copied data will be pasted.
Note that we're using the `After` parameter to specify the destination cell ""A1"" in each file. You can modify this parameter to specify the desired destination cell or range of cells.
1. Instead of manually opening each file and copying the data, we can use the `Range.Offset` method to create a new range of cells that covers the entire data in the specified sheet. Then, we can use the `Range.Copy` method to copy the entire range of cells to the current workbook.
Here's an example of how we can modify the code to use the `Range.Offset` method:
```vbnet
Sub Combine_files()

    Dim path As String

    path = ""C:\Users\prayag.purohit\OneDrive\Desktop\Project KC\New folder\""
    Dim file As Object

In this modified code, we're using the `Range.Offset` method to create a new range of cells that covers the entire data in the specified sheet. We're then using the `Range.Copy` method to copy the entire range of cells to the current workbook. Finally, we're closing each file using the `False` parameter of the `Workbooks.Close` method.
Note that we're using the `UsedRange` property of the `Worksheet` object to get the total number of rows and columns that are used by the data in the sheet. Then, we're multiplying this number by the `Rows` and `Columns` properties of the `Worksheet` object to get the total range of cells that we need to copy.
These are just a few suggestions for improving the code. You can modify the code to suit your needs and preferences.",0.8167527914047241,"excel, vba",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    return 0;
}

","The argument variable n is an int.
All operations you perform in the function are done using int values. Which you will overflow, leading to undefined behavior.
Change the argument type to unsigned long long.
I also recommend you change the return type to be unsigned as well, if you're not going to get negative results.
","  The problem you're facing is due to the way C++ handles integer arithmetic when the result of the calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`. In your case, the sum of the series 46341 exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`, which causes the return value of the function `seriesSum` to be truncated and represented as a negative number.
To fix this issue, you can use the `long long` data type instead of `int` for the calculation of the series sum. The `long long` data type can represent larger integers than `int`, so it can handle the calculation of the series sum without overflowing.
Here's the corrected version of your code:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

long long seriesSum(int n)
{
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int main()
{
    cout << seriesSum(46341); // expected 1073767311 but output is -1073716337

    return 0;
}

```
By using `long long` instead of `int` for the calculation, you ensure that the return value of the function is represented correctly and avoid the problem of negative numbers being returned.",0.5045320987701416,"c++, function-definition, integer-arithmetic",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73646644,default values for record properies,"If I have a Java record with 2 properties and I want to define default values for the properties which should be used instead of null. I can either override the getters
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    @Override
    public Boolean required() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }

    @Override
    public Set&lt;String&gt; strings() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.strings, Set.of());
    }
}

Or I can achieve much the same thing by overriding the default constructor
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    public MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
        this.strings = Objects.requireNonNullElse(strings, Set.of());
        this.required = Objects.requireNonNullElse(required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }
}

Both of these seem a bit verbose, is there a more concise way to assign default values to record properties?
","Overriding the accessor methods like in your first variant violates the expectation that you can create an equal object using the accessor methods and the canonical constructor. From the documentation

For all record classes, the following invariant must hold: if a record R's components are c1, c2, ... cn, then if a record instance is copied as follows:
    R copy = new R(r.c1(), r.c2(), ..., r.cn());

then it must be the case that r.equals(copy).

But with your overridden accessor method, the following assertion fails:
MyRecord r1 = new MyRecord(null, null), r2 = new MyRecord(r1.strings(), r1.required());
assert r1.equals(r2);

because the internal fields contain different data.
So the only correct way to fix input data is during the construction, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        if(strings == null) strings = Set.of();
        if(required == null) required = true;
    }
}

However, you shouldn’t do this null handling at all. Collections should never be null and using Boolean for the constructor implies having a Boolean record component type in general, i.e. also returned by the accessor method. And writing new MyRecord(null, null) instead of new MyRecord(Set.of(), true) doesn’t even save much typing.
If you want to support default values, you should overload the constructor, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
    public MyRecord() {
        this(Set.of(), true);
    }
}

So you can use new MyRecord() for the defaults. Or you consider that records are immutable, so constructing multiple instances of defaults isn’t necessary
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public static final MyRecord DEFAULT = new MyRecord(Set.of(), true);
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
}

and use MyRecord.DEFAULT whenever you need the default values. Of course, you still can provide overloaded constructors for the cases that only one parameter should have default values, if that is needed.
","  Yes, you can use a more concise way to assign default values to record properties by using the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation with the `null Safety` feature in Java 14 and later versions.
Here's an example of how you can use it:
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    @SuppressWarnings(""null"")
    public MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
        this.strings = strings != null ? strings : Set.of();
        this.required = required != null ? required : Boolean.TRUE;
    }
}

In this example, you can see that we have added the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation with the argument `null Safety` and inside the annotation, we have added the `null` keyword followed by the property name.
This will tell the compiler to suppress the warning that would be generated if the property is null when the record is created, and instead use the default value assigned.
By using this approach, you can simplify your code and make it more concise, while still providing default values for your record properties.
Note: The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is only available in Java 14 and later versions, so make sure you are using a compatible version of Java.",0.491865336894989,"java, record",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  The issue you're facing is due to the way pandas is interpreting the LaTeX code in the `to_latex()` method. By default, pandas adds an extra level of escaping to prevent SQL injection attacks. However, this leads to the extra slashes and \\` characters you're seeing in the output.
To get rid of these extra slashes, you can pass the `escape` parameter to `to_latex()` with a value of `False`. This will disable the extra escaping and result in the output you're expecting.
Here's an example:
`df.to_latex(escape=False)`
This should give you the output you're looking for, with rows separated by &amp; instead of \\.
Alternatively, you could use the `LaTeX` format string to specify the column separators and table headers directly. Here's an example:
`df.to_latex(format={'columns': '&', 'headers': '\\toprule'})`
This will give you the same output as before, but with the columns separated by & instead of \\, and the table headers separated by \\toprule instead of \\.

73504314,"Type hint for ""can be compared"" objects","I am writing several functions that handle ordered datasets.
Sometime, there is an argument that can be a int or float or a timestamp or anything that supports comparison (larger than / smaller than) and that I can use for trimming data for instance.
Is there a way to type-hint such a parameter? The typing module doesn't seem to include this, but is there some other way?
","There is no standard 'comparable' ABC, no, as the rich comparison methods are really very flexible and don't necessarily return booleans.
The default built-in types return NotImplemented when applied to a type they can't be compared with, for example, while specialised libraries like SQLAlchemy and numpy use rich comparison methods to return completely different objects. See the documentation for the rich comparison methods for the details.
But you should be able to define a
a Protocol subclass for specific expectations:
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)

class Comparable(Protocol[T]):
    def __eq__(self: T, other: T) -&gt; bool:
        ...

    def __lt__(self: T, other: T) -&gt; bool:
        ...

    # ... etc

You may need to tweak the protocol to fit your exact expectations, and / or use a non-generic version that's specific to the types you use (perhaps with @overloaded definitions for specific types).
For sorting with the builtin sorted() function, __eq__ and __lt__ suffice.
","  Yes, there are a few ways to handle type hints for variables that can be compared but are not necessarily a exact type. Here are a few options:
1. Use a union type: You can use a union type to indicate that the variable can take on any type that supports comparison. In Python, you can use the `Union` type from the `typing` module:
```
from typing import Union
def trim_data(value: Union[int, float, Timestamp]) -> None:
    # ...
```
This will allow the `value` parameter to take on any type that can be compared, and the function will work correctly regardless of the type passed in.
2. Use a generic type: You can define a generic type that accepts any type that supports comparison. In Python, you can use the `TypeVar` type from the `typing` module:
```
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
class Trimmer[T](object):
    def __init__(self, value: T) -> None:
    # ...

def trim_data(value: Trimmer[int]) -> None:
    # ...
```
This will create a generic class `Trimmer` that can be used with any type that supports comparison. The `trim_data` function will then work with any type that inherits from `Trimmer`.
3. Use a type hint with a wildcard: You can use a type hint with a wildcard (`*`) to indicate that the variable can take on any type:
```
def trim_data(value: *Type) -> None:
    # ...
```
This will indicate that the `value` parameter can take on any type, and the function will work correctly regardless of the type passed in.
4. Use a type hint with a union of types: You can use a type hint with a union of types (e.g. `int | float | Timestamp`) to indicate that the variable can take on any of those types. In Python, you can use the ` Union` type from the `typing` module:
```
from typing import Union
def trim_data(value: Union[int, float, Timestamp]) -> None:
    # ...
```
This will allow the `value` parameter to take on any of the specified types, and the function will work correctly regardless of the type passed in.
5. Use a type guard: In some cases, you may not be able to use a type hint for a variable that can take on multiple types, but you can still use a type guard to check the type of the variable at runtime. This can be useful if you have a function with multiple branches that depend on the type of the variable:
```
def trim_data(value: Any) -> None:
    if isinstance(value, int):
        # do something with an int
    elif isinstance(value, float):
        # do something with a float
    elif isinstance(value, Timestamp):
        # do something with a timestamp
    else:
        # do something with something else

```
This will check the type of the `value` parameter at runtime, and perform the appropriate action based on the type.
These are just a few options for handling type hints for variables that can be compared. The best approach will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the types you are working with.",0.5635185241699219,"python, type-hinting",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    }
    
    return this

","  Sure, I can help you with that! The issue you're facing is that the `parameters` variable in the second Groovy script is not a map, so you can't directly access its elements using `parameters.PARAM1`. To overcome this, you can use a combination of Groovy's built-in features to iterate over the contents of the `params.groovy` file and extract the parameters. Here's an example solution:
1. First, you can use the `GroovyScriptEngine` class provided by Jenkins to execute the `params.groovy` file and get its contents as a string. Here's an example method to do this:
```java
def loadParams() {
    def groovyScript = """"""
        def parameters = load &quot;params.groovy&quot;
        final_parameter = &quot;&quot;
        for (l in parameters) {
            if(l == &quot;&quot;) {
                final_parameter = l.key.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + l.value
            } else {
                final_parameter = final_parameter + &quot;&amp;|&amp;&quot; + l.key.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + l.value
            }
        }
    
        return final_parameter
    """"""
    def result = new GroovyScriptEngine().evaluate(groovyScript)
    return result.toMap().values()

```
In this method, we define a Groovy script that uses the `load` method to execute the `params.groovy` file and get its contents as a string. Then, we define a `final_parameter` variable to store the result of the iteration, and a `l` variable to iterate over the contents of the `parameters` string. Finally, we use the `toMap()` method to convert the `parameters` string to a map, and the `values()` method to get the values of the map.
2. To iterate over the contents of the `parameters` map, you can use a `for` loop and access the map's key-value pairs using the syntax `key.toUpperCase() + &=quot;=amp;&quot; + value`. Here's an example of how to modify the `loadParams()` method to iterate over the `parameters` map:
```java
def loadParams() {
    def groovyScript = """"""
        def parameters = load &quot;params.groovy&quot;
        final_parameter = &quot;&quot;
        for (l in parameters.keySet()) {
            if(l == &quot;&quot;) {
                final_parameter = l.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameters.get(l)
            } else {
                final_parameter = final_parameter + &quot;&amp;|&amp;&quot; + l.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameters.get(l)
            }
        }
    
        return final_parameter
    """"""
    def result = new GroovyScriptEngine().evaluate(groovyScript)
    return result.toMap().values()

```
In this modified `loadParams()` method, we use the `keySet()` method to get an iterator over the keys of the `parameters` map, and then iterate over the keys using a `for` loop. For each key, we use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the key to uppercase, and then concatenate it with an ampersand (`&`) and the value of the `parameters` map using the `+` operator. If the key is the empty string (`""""`), we use the value directly; otherwise, we use the `get()` method to get the value of the key, and concatenate it with an ampersand (`&`) and the key using the `+` operator.
3. Finally, you can use the `final_parameter` variable to return the processed parameter value from the `loadParams()` method. Here's an example of how to modify the `loadParams()` method to return the processed parameter value:

def loadParams() {
    def groovyScript = """"""
        def parameters = load &quot;params.groovy&quot;
        final_parameter = &quot;&quot;
        for (l in parameters.keySet()) {
            if(l == &quot;&quot;) {
                final_parameter = l.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameters.get(l)
            } else {
                final_parameter = final_parameter + &quot;&amp;|&amp;&quot; + l.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameters.get(l)
            }
        }
    
        return final_parameter
    """"""
    def result = new GroovyScriptEngine().evaluate(groovyScript)
    return result.toMap().values()

```
In this modified `loadParams()` method, we define a `final_parameter` variable to store the processed parameter value, and use it to return the value from the method.
With these modifications, you should be able to iterate over the contents of the `params.groovy` file and extract the parameters using the `toMap()` method and the `values()` method.

73206798,Launch EC2 Instance using IAM Role on Multiple AWS accounts,"We have multiple AWS accounts and one management account. We have one web application server in management account. From this server we can create EC2 instances on multiple AWS accounts using secret and access key. However, we would like to launch instance on other AWS accounts using IAM role. Is possible to lauch instances on other AWS accounts using IAM role (Instead of using access and secret key) ?
","The typical setup would be:

Create an IAM Role in each 'other' AWS Account

Give it the same name in each account to keep things simple
Grant it permission to launch an Amazon EC2 instance


To launch an instance in an 'other' account:

Assume the IAM Role in the target account (the desired Account ID would be specified in the chosen IAM Role's ARN)
Use the returned temporary credentials to launch the EC2 instance



","  Yes, it is possible to launch EC2 instances on other AWS accounts using an IAM role instead of access and secret key. Here are the steps you can follow:
1. Create an IAM role in the management account that grants the necessary permissions to launch EC2 instances on the other AWS accounts. This role should have the same name as the AWS account that it will be used to launch instances in.
2. In the management account, create an IAM instance profile that references the IAM role you created in step 1. This instance profile will be used to launch the EC2 instance using the IAM role.
3. Launch the EC2 instance in the management account using the instance profile you created in step 2. When prompted for security credentials, select ""Use an existing IAM role"" and choose the IAM role you created in step 1.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each AWS account that you want to launch instances on.
Here are some additional details to consider:
* Make sure that the IAM role you create in step 1 has the necessary permissions to launch EC2 instances on the other AWS accounts. This may include permissions to access the AWS API, as well as any additional resources that your application may need.
* When using an IAM role to launch instances, you will need to specify the AWS account ID that the role is associated with. You can do this by using the `--aws-account-id` flag when launching the instance. For example:
`aws ec2 launch-instances --count 1 --image-id ami-123456 --region us-west-2 --aws-account-id 123456789012 --role-name my-iam-role`
* If you are using an IAM role to launch instances on multiple AWS accounts, you will need to ensure that the role has the necessary permissions to access each of the accounts. This may involve creating separate IAM roles for each account, or modifying the existing role to include the necessary permissions.
By following these steps, you should be able to launch EC2 instances on multiple AWS accounts using an IAM role instead of access and secret key.",0.8152889609336853,"amazon-web-services, amazon-ec2, amazon-iam",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73676116,Specify callback function in dart/flutter that accepts two possible sets of parameters,"Is there a way to create a callback function that accepts one of two different sets of parameters? Or have two separate callback functions as options, and make sure at least one of them is specified?
I have a view that I want to pass a callback function, that either includes a Goal or a title and description (which would end up being put together into a goal).
void Function({required String title, String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString;
void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal;
I want one, but not both of these callbacks to be required - if there is a function with a goal as a parameter, I'd execute that, but if not, I'd execute the one with a String title and a String description. Something like this:
if (onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal != null) {
    // execute this callback function
} else {
    // execute onGoalPopupCompletionWithString
}

","That's not something which can be expressed in the Dart type system.
A single function which can be called as void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}) will have a signature of:
  void Function({String title, String? description, Goal goal})

Any implementation of that type will either have to make title and goal optional, or provide them with default values.
In either case, there is no way, in the type system, to ensure that the function is always invoked as one of the original types.
Also, it'll be highly annoying to write, you'd probably be better off with two different callbacks.
You can provide two callback parameters, one of each kind, and require that at least one of them is required ... but not in the type system. You'd have to make both optional, and check at runtime that at least one was provided.
Having as single parameter which accepts either function type, that requires a union type. A union type allows either one type or another, in this case either void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}). Dart does not have union types in general.
If you need to pass both of these types through the same currently valid Dart type, the type needs to be a supertype of both.
The closest common supertype of those two types is Function.
(The only function types that void Function({required Goal goal}) can be assigned to are void Function({required X goal}) where X is a subtype of Goal. I guess you can also change the void to another, equivalent, top-type.
Any other function type allows its functions to be called in a way that void Function({required Goal goal}) does not.)
Dart does have one kind of type union: Classes with subclasses.
You can declare a callback class:
abstract class MyCallback {
}
class TitleCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required String title, String? description}) callback;
  TitleCallback(this.callback);
}  
class GoalCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required Goal goal}) callback;
  GoalCallback(this.callback);
}  

Then you can require one such callback, and dispatch on it as necessary.
","  Yes, you can create a callback function in Dart that accepts one of two possible sets of parameters by using the `Optional` parameter in your function definition. Here's an example of how you can define two callback functions with different parameter sets:
```dart
void Function(
    {required String title, String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString;
void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal;
```
In this example, the `onGoalPopupCompletionWithString` callback function takes a `title` parameter and an optional `description` parameter. The `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` callback function takes a `goal` parameter that is required.
To ensure that at least one of the callback functions is specified, you can use a conditional statement in your code to execute the appropriate callback function based on the presence of the `goal` parameter. Here's an example of how you might do this:
```dart
if (onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal != null) {
    // Execute the onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal callback function
} else {
    // Execute the onGoalPopupCompletionWithString callback function
}
```
In this example, if `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` is not null, the code will execute the `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` callback function. Otherwise, it will execute the `onGoalPopupCompletionWithString` callback function.
You can also use the `default` keyword to specify a default value for the callback function if it is null. For example:
```dart
void Function({
    required String title, default String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString = _handleGoalPopupCompletion;
void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal = _handleGoalPopupCompletion;
```
In this example, if neither `onGoalPopupCompletionWithString` nor `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` is specified, the default callback function `_handleGoalPopupCompletion` will be executed.

Flex gives you much more flexibility (pun intended) and it's much easier to work with. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
","  The issue you're facing is that the margins of the `input[type=text]` and the `button` elements are connected, which means that any change to one margin will affect the other. This is due to the way CSS handles margin inheritance.
To unlink their margins, you can use the following approach:
1. Add a `display:block;` property to the `input[type=text]` element. This will make the element a block-level element, which means it will no longer inherit margins from its containing element.
2. Add a `margin:0;` property to the `input[type=text]` element. This will remove any existing margins from the element.
3. Add a `margin:0;` property to the `button` element. This will remove any existing margins from the element.

73760219,Dialogflow CX - Transition to page using sentiment analysis score,"Does anyone know if it’s possible to transition to a different page solely off of a sentiment analysis score ($request.sentiment.score) of the end-user’s response?
I basically want the agent to ask the end-user a question and then have the agent route the user to a page strictly using the sentiment analysis score of the user’s response and nothing more

What I tried so far:
Through the Dialogflow-CX simulator, I am trying to transition to a different page using the conditional statement $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 in the route, however the agent does not transition to the next page and cannot match my input to the strictly conditional route (it just jumps to the sys.no-match-default event handler)
Here is a screenshot of the route I have set up:

As you can see, the route has no intents other than a conditional trigger that has $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 as the parameter.
I simply want the agent to direct the end-user to the next page whenever it detects a message with a negative sentiment score. The next screenshot shows that the agent detects that the sentiment score is negative, however the agent does not transition to the next page.

Does anyone know what I seem to be doing wrong?
",,"  Yes, it is possible to transition to a different page based solely on the sentiment analysis score of the end-user's response using Dialogflow-CX. The issue you're encountering seems to be related to the conditional statement in the route.
The problem is that the conditional statement in the route ($request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0) is not evaluating to true when the sentiment score is negative. This is because the sentiment score is a floating-point number, and when compared to zero, it will always evaluate to true, not false.
To fix this issue, you can modify the conditional statement to use a different comparison operator, such as `request.sentiment.score &lt; 0`. This will evaluate to true only when the sentiment score is negative, and false otherwise.
Here's an updated version of the route that should work as expected:
![Route with updated conditional statement](https://i.imgur.com/vJhMYg5.png)
In this updated route, the conditional statement is `request.sentiment.score &lt; 0`, which will evaluate to true only when the sentiment score is negative. When the sentiment score is positive or zero, the condition will evaluate to false, and the agent will transition to the next page.
Additionally, you can also add a check to make sure that the sentiment score is not null or empty, to avoid unnecessary transitions to the next page. You can add a condition like `request.sentiment.score != null && request.sentiment.score &lt; 0` to ensure that the sentiment score is not null or empty before transitioning to the next page.

I'm listening to only one added document in a collection.

No, you're not. You're attaching a snapshot listener to a collection and not to a single document:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

This means that you're listening for real-time updates for each operation that takes place inside the entire sub-collection called &quot;Collection&quot;.
What you're basically doing, you're saying, hey Firestore, give me all documents that exist in that sub-collection and keep the listener alive. This listener will be invoked every time a document in that collection changes over time.
If you want to listen to a single document, then you should add a call to .document() and pass a specific document ID:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(&quot;someDocumentId&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

In this way, you'll only be notified about the changes to a single document.
","  The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `addSnapshotListener()` method triggers an event for every document change, including deletions. To only listen for added documents and not deletions, you can use the `documentChanges` property of the `ListenerData` object and check the `type` property of each change event.
Here's an updated implementation of your `createListener()` function that should listen only for added documents:
```swift
func createListener() {
    guard let currentUid = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else { return }
    listener = db.collection(""Collection"").document(currentUid).collection(""Collection"").addSnapshotListener({ listenerSnapshot, error in
        if let error = error {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
            return
        }
        var addedDocuments = [DocumentChange]()
        listenerSnapshot?.documentChanges.forEach { change in
            if change.type == .added {
                let data = change.document.data()
                let myview = MYView(data: data)
                guard let window = UIApplication.shared.windows.last else { return }
                myview.present(to: window) {
                    change.document.reference.delete()
                }
                addedDocuments.append(change)
            }
        }
        // Now, delete the added documents
        addedDocuments.forEach { change in
            change.document.reference.delete()
        }
    })
}
```
In this updated implementation, we store the added documents in an array called `addedDocuments` and then delete them in a separate loop.
Note that we're using the `type` property of the `DocumentChange` object to check if the change is an addition. If the change is an addition, we add the document to the `addedDocuments` array and then delete it in a separate loop. If the change is a deletion, we skip the document.
This should solve the issue you're facing, and you should only hear back when an actual document has been added to the collection.",0.7196698784828186,"ios, swift, firebase, google-cloud-platform, google-cloud-firestore",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  To convert the print statements to a dictionary, you can use the `zip` function to pair each row and column, and then create a dictionary with the pairs. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:
`errors = { row[0]: { column: v, message: f""{v} is invalid"" } for row, v in df1.mask(mask|df1.eq(' ')).stack().iteritems() }`
In this code, we use the `mask` function to identify the rows and columns that have invalid values, and then `stack` the DataFrame to flatten it. We then use the `iteritems` method to iterate over the rows and columns, and create a dictionary `errors` to store the pairs. The `row[0]` refers to the first column of each row, and `column` refers to the column name. The `v` variable refers to the value in the current cell, and `message` is a string message that indicates why the value is invalid.
You can then use the `errors` dictionary to print the errors, or to perform any other action you want. For example, you could modify the `print` statement to `print(f""Error: {row[0]} - {column}: {v})` to print a more informative message.
Alternatively, you could also use the `numpy` `diag` function to create a diagonal matrix of errors, like this:
`diag = np.diag(df1.mask(mask|df1.eq(' ')).stack())`
You can then use the `diag` matrix to access the errors in a more convenient way, for example:
`error_row, error_col = diag[0]`

   style: TextStyle(fontFamily: &quot;Berlin&quot;, letterSpacing: 0.5),

with

","  The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to pass a `Text` widget as a parameter to the `BottomNavigationBarItem` widget, but the parameter type is inferred to be a `String`, not a `Text` widget.
To fix this, you can change the parameter type of the `BottomNavigationBarItem` widget to `Text`, like this:
```dart
BottomNavigationBarItem(
          icon: Icon(Icons.shop),
          label: Text(
            AppLocalizations.of(context).tr('Produce'),
            style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Berlin', letterSpacing: 0.5),
          )),
```
This way, you're passing a `Text` widget as the `label` parameter, which is the correct type for the parameter.
Alternatively, you can also change the return type of the `callPage` function to `Text`, like this:
```dart
Widget callPage(int currentIndex) {
        return Text(
          AppLocalizations.of(context).tr('Produce'),
          style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Berlin', letterSpacing: 0.5),
        );
```
This way, you're returning a `Text` widget directly, rather than calling a different widget, and the type error will be avoided.

73611950,How can i pass parameters to a function inside click eventlistner,"function changeColor(btn){
    btn.style.backgroundColor = &quot;red&quot;;
}
let btn1 = document.getElementById(&quot;1&quot;);
btn1.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;,changeColor(btn1));

I know that calling a function in the &quot;addEventListner&quot; immediately call the function . But I do need to pass a object to my function inside &quot;addEventListner()&quot; because I'm planning to use only one general function to handle clicks of 10 buttons.
","From the above comment ...

&quot;A handler function gets passed an Event type to it. An UI event always features a currentTarget and a target property. The OP should access the former ... event.currentTarget.style.backgroundColor = &quot;red&quot;;.&quot;

Instead of using the color changing function as callback one could implement a button specific click handler which forwards its current target to a generic function which changes the background color of any passed element reference.


function changeElementColor(elm){
  elm.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
}
function handleButtonClick(evt) {
  changeElementColor(evt.currentTarget);
}

document
  .querySelectorAll('button')
  .forEach(btnElm =&gt;

    btnElm.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick)
  );
&lt;button&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hallo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button&gt;&lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/button&gt;



","  Ah, I see! In this case, you can pass parameters to a function inside an event listener by using the `event` object as an argument to the function.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to pass a parameter to the `changeColor` function inside the event listener:
Instead of calling `changeColor(btn1)` directly inside the event listener, you can pass the `btn1` object as an argument to the function like this:
```
let btn1 = document.getElementById(""1"");
btn1.addEventListener(""click"", function(event) {
    changeColor(event.target, btn1);
});
```
By passing the `btn1` object as an argument to the `changeColor` function, you can access the button element inside the function using the `event.target` property. This way, you can use the `btn1` object to modify its style, for example.
Also, note that you don't need to use the `btn1.style` property to set the background color of the button. You can directly use the `event.target.style` property to modify the style of the button element.
Here's the complete modified code:
```
let btn1 = document.getElementById(""1"");
btn1.addEventListener(""click"", function(event) {
    changeColor(event.target, btn1);
});

function changeColor(btn, element) {
    element.style.backgroundColor = ""red"";
}

73546092,How do websites like jam.dev achieve their screenshotting functionality?,"does anyone know how websites like jam.dev achieve their click and drag screenshotting functionality?
I am trying to create a tool which involves screenshotting on the client side and my preferred way was to implement it in a similar fashion. Is anyone kind enough to point me in the right direction?
Some things I have tried and researched, but these don't provide the exact results I want:

html2canvas and other libraries that use svg and foreign object - these just don't produce consistent results.
rendering server side with puppeteer - it would be much better if the screenshotting could be achieved client side.
using webRTC - asking for permission and having the user select a screen/window is just not very intuitive.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
","Browsers share api for extensions that allows making a screenshot
Accoding to this answwer
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(null, {}, function (image) {
   // You can add that image HTML5 canvas, or Element.
});

","  Jam.dev and other websites that provide click-and-drag screenshotting functionality typically use a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to achieve this functionality. Here is a high-level overview of how it works:
1. User interactions are captured using JavaScript: The website uses JavaScript to capture the user's interactions, such as clicking and dragging, on the webpage. This is achieved by attaching event listeners to the HTML elements that the user interacts with.
2. HTML structures are created: The website uses HTML to create the necessary structures for the screenshot, such as a canvas element to hold the screenshot and a div element to display the screenshot.
3. Canvas element is drawn on: The website uses JavaScript to draw the screenshot on the canvas element. This involves rendering the HTML elements of the webpage onto the canvas using 2D drawing commands.
4. Image is captured: Once the screenshot is drawn on the canvas, the website uses JavaScript to capture the image as a base64-encoded string.
5. Image is displayed: Finally, the website displays the screenshot as an image using HTML and CSS. This can be done by displaying the base64-encoded image in a div element or by saving the image to a file and displaying it as an attachment.
Now, let's dive into the specific techniques and libraries that jam.dev and other websites use to achieve click-and-drag screenshotting functionality.
1. html2canvas: html2canvas is a popular library that allows you to capture a screenshot of a webpage using JavaScript. It uses the HTML5 canvas element to create a 2D rendering of the webpage and then captures the image as a Base64-encoded string. Jam.dev likely uses html2canvas to create the initial screenshot.
2. Puppeteer: Puppeteer is a Google-incubated project that allows you to automate the rendering of web pages using the Chrome DevTools Protocol. It provides a high-level API for capturing screenshots of web pages and can be used to render the webpage offline. Jam.dev may use Puppeteer to render the webpage offline and capture the screenshot.
3. SVG and foreignobject: Some websites use SVG and foreignobject to create a custom screenshot experience. Foreignobject allows you to render an SVG element within another SVG element, which can be used to create a custom screenshot frame. Jam.dev may use this technique to create a custom screenshot frame that matches the layout of the webpage.
4. WebRTC: WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of APIs that allow you to communicate peer-to-peer in real-time. Some websites use WebRTC to capture screenshots of web pages by sending a screenshot request to the browser and receiving the screenshot as a response. This approach can be more complex to implement, but it provides more control over the screenshot experience.
In conclusion, websites like jam.dev achieve their click-and-drag screenshotting functionality by using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and libraries like html2canvas, Puppeteer, and WebRTC. By capturing the user's interactions and rendering the screenshot on the client-side, these websites can provide a more seamless and efficient screenshot experience.",0.5241435766220093,"javascript, screenshot",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73300008,".NET Core Web API only gets JSON from the Mock Lambda Tool. Using Postman, Swagger & AWS Lambda fail","I recently wrote a .NET Core Web API to receive JSON from a Lambda SNS message event. The Lambda sends the SNS event message JSON (via a POST request) to the API.
When I use the 'Mock Lambda Tool' to send the SNS message to the API, all is well. It works great. The data arrives, my API's controller sees it and it sends it over to the class that parses the data sends it into a database.
So, I then published the API to IIS and tested it from the Mock Lambda Tool. That worked too.
Feeling good about the work I uploaded the Lambda to AWS (for real world scenarios), I did a quick test of the same SNS message (JSON) using the AWS Lambda console. It times out.
So, I decided to go back and try testing the API on IIS using Postman. It shows:
**POST** https://my.company.com/api/Transaction/

There is NO error, but note that the Response Body is all nulls.
I decided to run the API from Visual Studio so that I could step through the code as the SNS message arrives from the Lambda.

Using the Mock Lambda Tool, no errors. Data goes all the way through.
Using Postman, a breakpoint on the controller shows no Transaction data arriving (NULL).
Using Swagger, a breakpoint on the controller shows no Transaction data arriving (NULL).

Are there any ideas as to what I am missing or doing incorrectly?
This is my controller in the API:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using MyWebAPI.TransactionData;
using MyWebAPI.Models;

namespace MyWebAPI.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route(&quot;api/[controller]&quot;)]
    public class TransactionController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ITransactionData _transactionData;

        public TransactionController(ITransactionData transactionData)
        {
            _transactionData = transactionData;
        }

        {
            return &quot;You have reached the .NET Core Web API (web service).&quot;;

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult DataTranslation(Transaction transactionData)

                );
        }
    }
}

Here is my POST request in the Lambda:
public void PostRequest(string msg)
{
    var url = &quot;https://my.company.com/api/Transaction/&quot;; // IIS
    var httpRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);

I'm curious if it's my Post Request that is the problem?
Why is the 'Mock Lambda Tool' the only way I can get the data over to the API?
Thanks
","UPDATE. I learned that the Lambda at AWS required a VPC to my internal VM that hosts the API on IIS. That solves why the Lambda at AWS timed out repeatedly.
As for Postman and Swagger problem, the issue is that the Mock Lambda Tool sends the entire SNS message event in its natural full format, then the Lambda extracts the Message portion only to send over to the API.
I was sending this entire SNS message event across Swagger and Postman both of which DO NOT do the work that the Lambda does which is strip just the Message portion out of the SNS event.
Once I sent only the Message portion across with Swagger and Postman, both worked.
I must give credit to my work buddy Dorian for helping me with this. Thanks! :)
","  Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue is with the JSON data being sent from the Lambda function to the ASP.NET Core Web API. Here are some potential reasons why the API is not receiving the data:
1. JSON serialization and deserialization: The Lambda function may not be correctly serializing the JSON data before sending it to the API. Make sure that the Lambda function is using the correct JSON serializer and that the data is being serialized correctly.
2. Content-Type header: The Content-Type header in the HTTP request is set to application/json, but the data being sent is not in JSON format. Make sure that the data is properly formatted as JSON before sending it to the API.
3. Request body size limit: The ASP.NET Core Web API may have a size limit for the request body. If the JSON data is too large, it may exceed the size limit and cause the API to reject the request. Check the API's configuration settings for the maximum request body size.
4. Character encoding: The JSON data may be encoded differently in the Lambda function than it is in the ASP.NET Core Web API. Make sure that the data is encoded correctly in both places to avoid any issues.
5. AWS Lambda function timing out: The Lambda function may be timing out before it can send the request to the API. Check the Lambda function's configuration settings to ensure that it has enough time to send the request.
6. DNS resolution: The Lambda function may be having trouble resolving the DNS name of the ASP.NET Core Web API. Check the DNS settings for both the Lambda function and the API to ensure that they are correct.
7. Firewall or security group issues: The Lambda function may be blocked by a firewall or security group that is preventing it from sending requests to the API. Check the security settings for both the Lambda function and the API to ensure that they are correct.
8. API configuration issues: There may be issues with the ASP.NET Core Web API's configuration that are preventing it from receiving the request. Check the API's configuration settings to ensure that they are correct.
To troubleshoot the issue further, you can try the following:
1. Use Postman or Fiddler to inspect the HTTP requests being sent by the Lambda function and the API. This can help you identify any issues with the request headers, body, or content type.
2. Set breakpoints in the Lambda function and the API to stop execution at specific points and inspect the data being sent. This can help you identify any issues with the data itself or the way it is being sent.
3. Use the ASP.NET Core Web API's debugging tools to inspect the request and response headers and body. This can help you identify any issues with the API's configuration or how it is handling the request.
4. Use the AWS Lambda function's debugging tools to inspect the request and response headers and body. This can help you identify any issues with the Lambda function's configuration or how it is handling the request.",0.494009405374527,"c#, json, api, iis, aws-lambda",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74367079,Where are the elevation colors in Flutter material you?,"I want my TextField widget to be elevated like Card or NavigationBar widgets. I'm using Material 3 (You).
I've tried using surface color from colors like:
Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surface

but it appears to be the same color as
Theme.of(context).colorScheme.background

","You can wrap your text_form_field widget with Card widget and give it elevation as well as boxShadow. It will work for you.
Card(
        child: //Your_text_form_field,
      elevation: 10,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        boxShadow: [
          new BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.red,
            blurRadius: 20.0,
          ),
        ],
      ),

","  Ah, I see! In Material 3, the elevation colors are no longer provided by the `surface` color property, as you've discovered. Instead, you can use the `elevation` property to apply elevation to a widget.
To make a `TextField` widget elevated like a `Card` or `NavigationBar` widget, you can use the `elevation` property and set it to a non-zero value. Here's an example:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
class _MyTextField extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyTextFieldState createState() => _MyTextFieldState();
}
class _MyTextFieldState extends State<_MyTextField> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(

          ),
          elevation: 2.0,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
In this code, we've added the `elevation` property to the `TextField` widget and set its value to 2.0. This will give the `TextField` widget a 2D elevation effect, making it appear raised relative to the surrounding widgets.
Note that the `elevation` property takes a double value representing the elevation distance in pixels. You can adjust this value to achieve the desired level of elevation for your widget.
Also, keep in mind that the `elevation` property only works for widgets that have a material design theme applied to them. If you're using a different theme, you may need to use a different approach to achieve the desired elevation effect.

    ... # other urls
]

","  Sure, I can help you fix the problem you're facing with auto-filling the PK of the employee's page in the form. Here's a possible solution:
1. In your view.py, you can use the `request.pton` attribute to access the PK of the current employee page. Here's an example:
```
def createDocument(request):
    employee_pk = request.pton
    # ... rest of the code ...
```
By doing this, you can pass the PK of the employee page as a keyword argument to the `documentForm()` function, which will automatically fill in the `employee_pk` field with the correct value.
2. In your form, you can add a `Employee` field to automatically fill in the PK of the employee page. Here's an example:
```
class documentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Document
        fields = ('employee', 'document_type', 'document_name', ...)
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        employee = Employee.objects.get(pk=self.employee_pk)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    def clean_employee(self):
        employee = Employee.objects.get(pk=self.employee_pk)
        return employee

```
By doing this, you can use the `Employee.objects.get(pk=self.employee_pk)` method to retrieve the `Employee` instance associated with the current PK, and pass it as a field in the form.
3. In your template, you can use Jinja templating to pass the `employee_pk` variable to the form. Here's an example:

{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
  <h1>Add Document</h1>
  <form method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
      {{ forms.as_p }}
      <input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"">

{% endblock %}

In this example, you can use the `{{ forms.as_p }}` template tag to display the form fields, and pass the `employee_pk` variable to the `forms.as_p()` method to automatically fill in the `employee` field in the form.
By following these steps, you should be able to auto-fill the PK of the employee page in the form when the user submits the form.",0.6592597961425781,"python, html, django",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

            if (error != null) {
                return Result.failure&lt;Throwable&gt;(error)
            } else if (token != null) {
                return Result.success(token)
            }
        }
        return Result.failure(throw IllegalAccessException())
    }

","You may need to do callback to suspend conversion.
Here is a simple example of doing this:
suspend fun signInWithABC(): String = suspendCoroutine { continuation -&gt; 
        abcApi.signIn(){ token, error -&gt;
            if (error != null) {
               continuation.resume(&quot;Error&quot;)
            } else {
               continuation.resume(token) // Assuming token is a string
            }
        }            
    }

","  The problem you're facing is that the `callback` parameter in the `abcApi.signIn()` function is a callback function that takes two parameters `token` and `error`, but you want to return a value from the callback function to the `ViewModel`.
The issue is that in Kotlin, a lambda function can only return values for a block, not for a function. So you can't return a value directly from the lambda function.
A possible solution is to create an extension function in your ViewModel that takes a lambda function as a parameter and returns a `Result` object. Here's an example:
in your ViewModel class:
```kotlin
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    fun signInWithABC(callback: (OAuthToken?, Throwable?) -> Unit) {
        // Call the ABC API sign-in method
        abcApi.signIn(callback = callback) { token, error ->
            // Return the result to the ViewModel
            return Result.success(token)
        }
    }
```
In this example, the `signInWithABC` function takes a lambda function as a parameter and calls the `abcApi.signIn()` method with that lambda function as a parameter. The lambda function takes two parameters `token` and `error` and returns a `Result` object.
You can then call this function from your activity like this:
```kotlin

fun signInWithABC() {
    val callback = { token, error ->
        if (error != null) {
            // Handle error
        } else if (token != null) {
            // Handle success
        }
    }

    val result = viewModel.signInWithABC(callback)

    // Handle the result
}
```
By using this approach, you can return the result of the `callback` function to the `ViewModel` and handle it in the `signInWithABC` function.
Additionally, you can also consider using the `ViewModel` to handle the authentication flow and return the result directly to the `Activity`. This approach can make the code more clean and easy to maintain.",0.3501969873905182,"android, kotlin, callback",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74354445,What does the FC field represent in the MIPS machine code for floating point compare instructions? Refer to figure below,"
Can you also tell me how to assembler behaves for values of FC=00,01,10 and 11.
When I execute the instruction on my assembler - I found FC=11. But I have no idea what it means.
","The 2-bit fc field and the following 4 bits, both together, are really just the 6-bit func field.
I don't know why those authors choose break this apart into two side-by-side fields as it seems to serve no particular purpose that I can see.
Further, while they break the func field in two just for those several instructions, they revert to depiction of a 6-bit func field for all other instruction descriptions.
Because of this notation, in looking for an fc field of 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, with the subsequent 4 bits being 0xc, we can also look for func field values of 0x0c, 0x1c, 0x2c, and 0x3c, some of which can be found.
A func value of 0x3c is for c.lt.s/d (with the proper opcode=0x11 and fmt=0x10/0x11 for single vs. double, of course).
A func field value of 0x0c is for round.w.s/d.
The other values, 0x1c &amp; 0x2c are not to be found in the documentation, and this sort of omission is typical of unused opcodes, so one possibility is then that these are indeed unused opcodes for the R2000.
Entering 46 00 00 3c into https://disasm.pro/ (MIPS/big-endian) yields the proper c.lt.s, and 46 00 00 0c yields the expected round.w.s, whereas ending in 1c or 2c yield no disassembly.
Another source, MIPS green sheet, offers the same answers: 0x0c is for round and 0x3c for compare, while 0x1c and 0x2c are shown as unassigned.

What would we expect the processor to do with unassigned opcodes?  It is unclear and typically unspecified in great detail.  It takes work to detect these things so designers may allow the implementation to do what is most convenient (i.e. lowest hardware effort).  Thus, unspecified can be by omission or maybe even by explicitly being defined as undefined behavior!  Possibilities for execution range from causing some kind of exception/fault (unimplemented), to decoding the instruction improperly, which might mean running an instruction of very similar encoding.
","  Of course, I'd be happy to help!
In MIPS machine code, the FC field represents the floating-point compare operation being performed. The FC field is a 2-bit field that specifies whether the compare operation is a less-than (LT), greater-than (GT), equal-to (EQ), or not-equal (NE) comparison.
Here are the possible values for the FC field, along with their meanings:
* 00: less-than comparison (LT)
* 01: greater-than comparison (GT)
* 10: equal-to comparison (EQ)
* 11: not-equal comparison (NE)

Now, let's take a look at the specific instruction you provided:
000000000: 48010000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
This instruction is a floating-point compare instruction, with the following parts:
* $0000: 48: The opcode for the compare instruction
* $0001: 00000000: The value to be compared (in little-endian format)
* $0002: 00000000: The value to be compared (in little-endian format)
* $0003: 00000000: The floating-point compare operation (determined by the FC field)

Now, let's interpret the FC field in this instruction:
* FC=11: This indicates that the compare operation is an equal-to comparison (EQ).
In summary, the instruction is comparing the two floating-point values (encoded in $0001 and $0002) and determining if they are equal.
Regarding the assembler behavior for different values of FC, here's how it would work:
* FC=00: This would generate a less-than comparison (LT) operation.
* FC=01: This would generate a greater-than comparison (GT) operation.
* FC=10: This would generate an equal-to comparison (EQ) operation.
* FC=11: This would generate a not-equal comparison (NE) operation.

","Based on the variables and code you have provided, you would have to change count so it uses the length of one of the lists. For example:

","  The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that you're trying to create two separate Glue jobs within the same `aws_glue_job` resource. Terraform expects each resource to have a unique name, and since you're trying to create two separate Glue jobs with the same name (`etl_jobs`), Terraform is prohibiting the creation of the second job.
To fix this issue, you can create a separate `aws_glue_job` resource for each Glue job you want to create. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:
main.tf:
``` tfsec
resource ""aws_glue_job"" ""job1"" {
  count = var.created_GL ? 1 : 0
  name = ""sql_db_job1""
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.glue_role.arn

    python_version  = var.python_version
    script_location = ""s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job.py""
  }
  default_arguments = {
    ""--extra-jars""                       = var.JarDir
    ""--TempDir""                          = var.TempDir
    ""--class""                            = ""GlueApp""

    ""--enable-spark-ui""                  = var.enable_spark_ui

""--job-bookmark-option""                 = var.job_bookmark_option
""--job-language""                      = ""python""

  }

  count = var.created_GL ? 1 : 0
  name = ""sql_db_job2""

    ""--enable-spark-ui""                  = var.enable_spark_ui


""--job-bookmark-option""                 = var.job_bookmark_option

""--job-language""                      = ""python""

""--env""                                 = var.paramregion

""--spark-event-logs-path""                 = var.sparkeventlogpath

  }
```
In this example, I've created two separate `aws_glue_job` resources: `aws_glue_job.job1` and `aws_glue_job.job2`. Each job has its own unique name, and the `command` block and `default_arguments` block are defined separately for each job.
By doing this, Terraform will create two separate Glue jobs, each with its own set of configuration options.
Note that you'll also need to update the `variable.tf` file to include separate lists for each Glue job, like this:
``` tfsec
variable ""db2jobnames"" {
  description = ""db2 glue job names""
  type        = list
  default     = [""sql_db_job"", ""sql_db_job2""]
}

variable ""script_location"" {
  description = ""db2 glue job scripts""
  type        = list
  default     = [""s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job.py"", ""s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job2.py""]
}
```
This way, Terraform will create two separate sets of Glue jobs, each with its own set of configuration options.",0.7008342146873474,"amazon-web-services, terraform, aws-glue, terraform-provider-aws",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","You can create array with finished sets and compare it (try the snippet pls):


new Vue({
  el: ""#demo"",
  data() {
    return {
      exercises: [{ id: 1, name: 'exercise1', sets: 3 }, { id: 2, name: 'exercise2', sets: 2 }, { id: 3, name: 'exercise3', sets: 4 }],

    }
  },
  computed: {
    checkAll() {
      return this.exercises.reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr.sets, 0) === this.finishedSets.length
    }
  },
  methods: {
    compareObjects(o1, o2) {
      return Object.entries(o1).sort().toString() !== Object.entries(o2).sort().toString()
    },
    findObject(id, set) {
      return this.finishedSets.find(f =&gt; f.id === id &amp;&amp; f.set === set)
    },
    completeSet(id, set) {
      this.findObject(id, set) ? 
        this.finishedSets = this.finishedSets.filter(f =&gt; {return this.compareObjects(f, this.findObject(id, set))}) :
        this.finishedSets.push({id, set})
    },
    isFinished(id, set) {
      return this.findObject(id, set) ? true : false
    },

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button v-if=""checkAll""&gt;submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;{{finishedSets}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



","  To mark each set as completed by setting its value to true or false, you can use the `v-model` directive in Vue to bind the value of each set to a reactive state in your component. Here's how you can modify your code:
First, create a reactive state in your component:
```
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      completes: {} // Initially, all sets are incomplete
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Initialize completes state with initial data from exercises
    this.completes = exercises.forEach((exercise) => {
      const setCount = exercise.sets.length;
      exercise.completes = Set.all(exercise.sets, (set) => {
        return set.completed; // Set initial value to false
      });
    })
  },
  methods: {
    completeSet(setId) {
      // Update completes state for the set
      this.completes[setId] = !this.completes[setId];
    }
  },
  template: `
  <div>
    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-for=""exercise in exercises"" :key=""exercise.id"">
        <span @click=""completeSet(exercise.id)"">{{ exercise.name }}</span>
        <ul v-if=""exercise.completes"">
          <li v-for=""set in exercise.completes"" :key=""set.id"">{{ set.name }}</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  `
}
```
In this modified code, we've added a `completes` reactive state to the component, which is initialized to an empty object. Then, we've used the `v-model` directive to bind the value of each set to the `completes` state:
```
<template v-for=""exercise in exercises"" :key=""exercise.id"">
  <span @click=""completeSet(exercise.id)"">{{ exercise.name }}</span>
  <ul v-if=""exercise.completes"">
    <li v-for=""set in exercise.completes"" :key=""set.id"">{{ set.name }}</li>
  </ul>

```
Now, when you click on a set, the `completeSet()` method will be called, which will update the `completes` state for that set to the opposite value (i.e., `!completes[setId]`). This will update the UI to show the set as completed or incomplete.

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



","  Yes, I can suggest a better solution to achieve the desired layout with almost the same result.
Instead of using the `display: flex` property on the `.container` element, you can use the `display: grid` property and define the grid template for the container. This will give you more control over the layout and make it easier to position the sections.
Here's an example of how you can modify your CSS:
.wrapper {
  background: lightgray;
  padding-block: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.container {
  border: dotted 1px red;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  margin-inline: auto;
 }

section {
  padding-block: 100px;
  border: solid 1px blue;
  position: relative;
  isolation: isolate;
}

.left {
  background: green;

}

.right {
  background: orange;

}

In this updated CSS, we've removed the `display: flex` property from the `.container` element and instead used `display: grid`. We've also defined a grid template for the container, which specifies two equal columns. This will make it easier to position the `.left` and `.right` sections within the container.
Note that we've also added the `fr` unit to the grid template, which means that the grid cells will be filled with equal fractions of the available space. This will ensure that the sections are evenly distributed within the container.
With this updated CSS, you can still use the `before` pseudo-element to create the background section for each section, but you'll have more control over the layout and can use the `grid` property to position the sections within the container.",0.7490925788879395,css,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I could retrieve them in separate queries, but it would make things uglier.
Edit: Assume table_one has one column: 'value', and table_two has columns: 'id' and 'fee' for the sake of this example.
","Thank you, @shawnt00:
CROSS JOIN is a simpler join for this scenario.
Another solution I've found since asking is
LEFT JOIN ON true

","  Ah, I see! You're trying to join two result sets that contain single-row/single-value results, and you're not sure how to approach this. This is a common challenge, and there are a few ways to handle it depending on your specific use case and the behavior you desire. Here are a few options you could consider:
1. Use a subquery: One way to handle this is to use a subquery to return the desired values from each table, and then join the subqueries using the common column(s). Here's an example of how you could modify your original query to use a subquery:
SELECT 
    values.value, fee.fee, total.total 
FROM 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value) AS values 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition) values 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, fee.fee 
     FROM table_two 
     WHERE condition) fee USING (joint) 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value + fee) AS total 
     FROM (SELECT 1 AS joint, value AS value, fee.fee AS fee 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition) AS subquery ON subquery.joint = fee.joint) total ON values.joint = total.joint;

This will return the desired values from each table, and then join them based on the common column(s).
2. Use a Common Table Expression (CTE): Another option is to use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to define the result set of one of the subqueries, and then join that CTE with the other subquery. Here's an example of how you could modify your original query to use a CTE:
WITH values AS (
    SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value) AS values 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition)
SELECT 
    values.value, fee.fee, total.total 
FROM values 
    LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, fee.fee 
     FROM table_two 
     WHERE condition) fee USING (joint) 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value + fee) AS total 
     FROM values) total ON values.joint = total.joint;

This will define the `values` CTE and then use it in the join with the `fee` and `total` subqueries.
3. Use a derived table: Another option is to use a derived table to define the result set of one of the subqueries, and then join that derived table with the other subqueries. Here's an example of how you could modify your original query to use a derived table:
SELECT 
    values.value, fee.fee, total.total 
FROM (
    SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value) AS values 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition) AS values 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, fee.fee 
     FROM table_two 
     WHERE condition) fee USING (joint) 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value + fee) AS total 
     FROM values) total ON values.joint = total.joint;

This will define the derived table `values` and then use it in the join with the `fee` and `total` subqueries.
4. Use a subquery with a join: Another option is to use a subquery with a join to return the desired values from each table, and then join the subqueries using the common column(s). Here's an example of how you could modify your original query to use a subquery with a join:
SELECT 
    values.value, fee.fee, total.total 
FROM (
    SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value) AS values 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition) values 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, fee.fee 
     FROM table_two 
     WHERE condition) fee USING (joint) 
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 1 AS joint, SUM(value + fee) AS total 
     FROM (SELECT 1 AS joint, value AS value, fee.fee AS fee 
     FROM table_one 
     WHERE condition) AS subquery ON subquery.joint = fee.joint) total ON values.joint = total.joint;

This will return the desired values from each table, and then join them based on the common column(s).

In general, the best approach will depend on the specific use case and the desired behavior of the query. The options above are just a few possibilities to consider.",0.45957475900650024,"sql, postgresql",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `case_when` function is not aware of the length of the NA values in the `i1` column. To fix this, you can modify the `case_when` statement to use the `any()` function to check if there are any NA values in `i1`, and then use the `apply()` function to apply the transformations to each row separately. Here's the modified code:
df %>% mutate(i2 = apply(c(i1, NA), any, function(x) NA_real_))
This code first creates a new column `c(i1, NA)` that includes both the non-NA values in `i1` and the NA values. Then, it uses the `any()` function to check if there are any NA values in this column. If there are any, the `apply()` function is used to apply the transformation to each row. In this case, the transformation is to set `i2` to NA_real_.",0.6761617660522461,"r, recode",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also &quot;D:/Git Repo/c++/networking/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log&quot;.

","When you use target_include_directories there is not target named networking_examples. You add that target after.
Order matters, and just like in C++ symbols must be defined before they can be used.

add_executable(

  ./src/index.cpp

# Asio library header directory
target_include_directories(networking_examples PRIVATE &quot;./asio-1.24.0/include&quot;)


On another couple of notes: First you don't seem to be using Boost ASIO but rather the standalone header-only library.
Secondly, you don't link with the library (it's a header-only library). You only tell the build-system where it can find the ASIO header files.
","  Sure, I can help you fix the issue with linking Boost.ASIO with your CMake project.
First of all, it looks like you are using CMake version 3.10 or later, as you have mentioned in the top of your CMakeLists.txt file. In CMake version 3.10 or later, the `target_include_directories` command was introduced, which allows you to specify include directories for a target only if it is built by this project. Since you are using a third-party library like Boost.ASIO, it is not possible to specify include directories for the target ""networking_examples"" which is not built by this project.
To solve this issue, you can use the `find_package` command to locate the Boost.ASIO library and include directories. Here's an example of how you can modify your CMakeLists.txt file to link Boost.ASIO with your project:
Before:
```cmake
# Set up the project
project(networking_examples)

# Set up the C++ compiler and standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER D:/System/msys2/mingw64/bin/clang++)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Link Boost Asio library
target_include_directories(networking_examples PRIVATE &quot;./asio-1.24.0/include&quot;)

add_executable(networking_examples ./src/index.cpp)
```
After:
```cmake
# Find Boost.ASIO
find_package(Boost COMPONENTS asio REQUIRED)

# Set include directories for Boost.ASIO
set(Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS ${Boost::INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link Boost Asio library
target_link_directories(networking_examples PRIVATE ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(networking_examples ./src/index.cpp)
```
In the modified CMakeLists.txt file, we've added the `find_package` command to locate the Boost.ASIO library. We've also set the `Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS` variable to the include directories of the Boost.ASIO library.
Note that you need to replace the path to the Boost.ASIO library with the path to yourBoost.ASIO installation.
Also, make sure that you have the Boost.ASIO library installed in your system and that it is configured correctly.
After making these changes, try running `cmake .` and `cmake --build .` again to see if it resolves the issue.

73611112,Is there way to create types like Array in typescript,"Is there a way to create type in typescript with methods that when I call these methods, they have access to the variable's value? Equals what the array, for example, which has the method find.
Example:
const arrayVar: Array = [1,2,3];

array.find(el =&gt; el === 1); 

In this case, find has access to the value of the array arrayVar without me having to pass it via a parameter to a function, for example, I wanted to create something in this way, for example:
const myVar: MyCustomType = 5;

myVar.add(2); // Nesse caso, o retorno seria 7. 

I know it can be done with classes and functions, but then I would have to pass the value of &quot;myVar&quot; as a parameter (function add (value1, value2), for example), I wanted a way to access it directly, just like the type Array does in its methods.
","To make a subclass of Number with new methods:
class SwagNumber extends Number {
  add(number: number) {
    // Tell the TS compiler that `this` is an unboxed Number
    return (this as unknown as number) + number;
  }
}

Then to use:
const six = new SwagNumber(6);

six will be typed to SwagNumber by the TS compiler.
And to show it works:
six.add(5)
&gt; 11

Let's look at the Constructor used, part of the Class:
&gt; six.constructor
[class SwagNumber extends Number]

This will also leave the original Number prototype unchanged, which will stop any potential issues (double dots are used to use a method on a number, to distinguish the dot from a decimal point!)
&gt; 3..constructor
[Function: Number]

or:
&gt; (3).constructor
[Function: Number]

See Classes on MDN
However there's some danger here
Since SwagNumber is an object, and a regular number isn't an object by default (until you call its methods), comparisons won't work properly:
&gt; six === 6
false

See Why should you not use Number as a constructor?
","  Yes, in TypeScript, you can create a custom type that mimics the behavior of an array by using a combination of type aliases, interfaces, and type inference. Here's an example of how you could create a custom type called `MyCustomType` that has a `find()` method that can access the value of the variable directly:
```
```
import { TypeAlias } from ""ts-module"";
type MyCustomType = TypeAlias<{
  [key: string]: any; };
// Define an interface that represents the structure of the custom type
interface MyCustomTypeMethods {
  find(callback: (value: any) => boolean): any;
}
// Define the type of the variable that will hold the custom type
const myVar: MyCustomType = { someProperty: ""example"" };
// Call the find() method on the variable
myVar.find(value => value === ""example""); // This will return the value ""example""

```

In this example, we define a type alias called `MyCustomType` that represents an object with a { [key: string]: any } structure. We then define an interface called `MyCustomTypeMethods` that defines the `find()` method that takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function should return a boolean value.
Finally, we define the type of the `myVar` variable as `MyCustomType` and call the `find()` method on it directly, passing the callback function as an argument. This will return the value of the `someProperty` property of `myVar`.
This approach allows you to create a custom type that behaves similarly to an array, with methods like `find()` that can access the value of the variable directly without the need to pass it as a parameter.",0.4126020073890686,"javascript, typescript, types",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

You're storing the list of items in a `UserDefaults` container and you're trying to sort the list by date, add new items, and display the total number of items.
Here are some suggestions to improve your code:
1. Use a `Date` struct instead of a string to represent the date. This will make it easier to perform date-related operations.
2. Use the `sorted` function to sort the `ItemList` array by date. You can use the `date` property to sort the items in descending order by date.
3. Add a `completion` closure to the `addItem` function to perform any additional actions after a new item is added. This will allow you to update the total number of items and sort the list again after each new item is added.
4. Use the `@State` decorator to mark the `name` and `int` variables as stateful, so that they will be recreated each time the view is updated. This will ensure that the view is updated correctly when the user types a new name or integer value.
5. Use the `@Published` decorator to mark the `ItemList` variable as published, so that it will be updated correctly whenever the `load` function is called.
6. Use the `NumberFormatter` class to format the integer values as strings, so that they will be displayed correctly in the user interface.
7. Add a `discard` function to the `ItemViewModel` class to discard any unwanted items from the list. This will allow you to remove items from the list without having to modify the `ItemList` array directly.
8. Consider using a `struct` to represent the items in your list, instead of a `class`. This will make it easier to create new instances of the item struct and will also ensure that the items are immutable.
Here is an example of how your code could look like after applying these suggestions:
```
import SwiftUI
struct Item: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var int: Int
    var date: Date

Note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Also, keep in mind that the `UserDefaults` class is not the best choice for storing a list of items. It's not intended for that purpose and it can cause performance issues.

How is it possible to produce a dataframe with columns based the previous list:

2   &lt;NA&gt;

This dataframe checks in dfdata in every column, expect the first id column, if any of the values in dfcheck dataframe exist and creates two new columns with the status and stock of dfcheck. From the dfcheck the column name has more than one values separated by &quot;;&quot;
","Libraries:
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)

First you'd need to tidy your dfcheck data.frame:
dfcheck_tidy &lt;- dfcheck %&gt;%
  mutate(name = str_split(name, &quot;;&quot;)) %&gt;%
  unnest(name)

(I'm not using tidyr::separate to do this as it seems from your example that you can have a variable length of names separated by &quot;;&quot;.)
And now you can perform the two joins:
dfdata %&gt;%
  left_join(dfcheck_tidy,
            by = c(&quot;title1&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) %&gt;%
  left_join(dfcheck_tidy,
            by = c(&quot;title2&quot; = &quot;name&quot;),
            suffix = c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;))
#    id  title1  title2    status1          stock1 status2 stock2
# 1 id1 amazon1  yahoo2 open/close  company energy    open  other
# 2 id2 google1    &lt;NA&gt; open/close  company energy    &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;
# 3 id3  yahoo1 amazon2      close goods and books    open  other

","  To accomplish this task, you can use the `merge` function in R to combine the `dfdata` and `dfcheck` dataframes based on the `id` column, and then use the `ifelse` function to create new columns in `dfdata` based on the values in `dfcheck`.
Here's the code to achieve the expected output:
```
# merge the dataframes based on the id column
dfdata_merged <- merge(dfdata, dfcheck, by = ""id"")
# create new columns for status and stock based on the values in dfcheck
dfdata_merged$status1 <- ifelse(dfcheck$stock == ""company energy"", ""open/close"", dfcheck$status)
dfdata_merged$stock1 <- ifelse(dfcheck$stock == ""company energy"", dfcheck$name, dfdata$stock)

# create a new column for status2 based on the values in dfcheck
dfdata_merged$status2 <- ifelse(is.na(dfdata$title2), NA, dfcheck$status)

# create a new column for stock2 based on the values in dfcheck
dfdata_merged$stock2 <- ifelse(is.na(dfdata$title2), NA, dfcheck$stock)

# inspect the merged dataframe
inspect(dfdata_merged)

```
The `merge` function is used to combine the dataframes based on the `id` column. The `ifelse` function is used to create new columns in `dfdata_merged` based on the values in `dfcheck`. The `is.na` function is used to check if the values in `dfdata$title2` are missing, and if so, assign `NA` to the new columns.

74484753,Communication between injected class service (AppState) and components,"I want to figure out what's the best approach to send re-render requests to a component when an application wide class' (AppState pattern) property has changed.
Following this nice blog post from Chris Sainty, the third example is exactly the kind of thing I want to achieve.
Have a singleton/scoped service, AppState, with the main purpose to store session data to be consumed by several components, invoking an event action when one of it's properties changes, after getting some data from an external api for example. The component can then listen to that and call StateHasChanged() to re-render the page.
This works but I have a couple of questions about the method.

Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default? Either for the event based communication or the whole AppState service. I'd imagine this is quite a common problem and perhaps I'm missing some default functionality like @bind.

Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable? I understand why
it needs to be disposed of, but why don't we need to do it when, for
instance, binding some data to an input field to essentially do the
same thing? Does the @bind attribute already handle that under the hood?


Thanks in advance and sorry if I'm missing something obvious, still learning the ropes of Blazor.
","
Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default?

For Communication between unrelated components, we have different options:

AppState registered as Scoped/Singleton. (extra overhead of registering and disposing event).
AppState as razor file (code example is given below).
Follow MVVM pattern for storing state, but there is downside to this approach we need to inject every view model as Scoped/Singleton. (If we are re using same component multiple times then each component state will be same).

Based on the requirement you can choose the best.
Example for AppState as razor file (preserving state of counter)
App.razor will look like this:
&lt;AppState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly=&quot;@typeof(App).Assembly&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Found Context=&quot;routeData&quot;&gt;
            &lt;RouteView RouteData=&quot;@routeData&quot; DefaultLayout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;FocusOnNavigate RouteData=&quot;@routeData&quot; Selector=&quot;h1&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;PageTitle&gt;Not found&lt;/PageTitle&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/AppState&gt;

and AppState.razor will look like this:
&lt;CascadingValue Value=&quot;this&quot;&gt;
    @ChildContent
&lt;/CascadingValue&gt;

@code {
    private int _count;

    [Parameter]
    public required RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }//use 'required' only if .net version is 7 &amp; above

    public int Count
    {
        get =&gt; _count; 
        set
        {
            _count = value;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }
}

and Counter.razor will look like this:
@page &quot;/counter&quot;

&lt;PageTitle&gt;Counter&lt;/PageTitle&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Counter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p role=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Current count: @State.Count&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; @onclick=&quot;IncrementCount&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    public required AppState State { get; set; }//use 'required' only if .net version is 7 &amp; above

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        State.Count++;
    }
}


Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable?

No, only an extra overhead, we need to dispose all unmanged resource manually.
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your question!
Firstly, let's start with the concept of AppState in your application. It's a Singleton/Scoped service that stores session data and triggers an event when one of its properties changes. Components can then listen to this event and call StateHasChanged() to re-render the page. This approach is a common pattern in Blazor applications, and it's a good way to share data between components.
Now, let's address your questions:
1. Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate ways implemented into the language by default?
There are other ways to implement communication between components and a shared service in Blazor. One popular approach is to use the @bind attribute to bind the service to a component's properties. This allows components to automatically update when the service changes. However, this approach doesn't provide a way to notify all components that listen to the service's events when a property has changed.
Another approach is to use a messaging system, such as the PlatformMessageChannel API, to communicate between components and the AppState service. This allows you to send messages between components and the service, and components can listen to these messages to update their state.
So, it depends on your specific requirements and preferences. If you want a simple solution that works well for most cases, using @implements IDisposable and events might be sufficient. However, if you need more fine-grained control over the communication or want to use a more lightweight approach, you could consider using @bind or messaging systems.
2. Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable?
Implementing IDisposable has some advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages:
* It allows you to properly clean up ressources when the component is no longer needed, improving application performance and stability.
* It makes it easier to manage dependencies in complex components.
Disadvantages:
* It adds an extra layer of complexity to your component, as you need to manage the dispose cycle.
* It can lead to memory leaks if not properly implemented.
It's worth noting that in Blazor, the framework takes care of disposing of components when they are no longer needed, so you don't need to worry about memory leaks when using @implements IDisposable. However, you still need to properly implement the dispose cycle to prevent memory leaks.
3. I understand why it needs to be disposed of, but why don't we need to do it when binding some data to an input field?
Blazor handles the disposal of components automatically when the component tree is updated. When a component is no longer needed, the framework will dispose of it. This means that you don't need to manually dispose of a component when binding data to an input field.
However, if you're using a service that needs to be accessed from multiple components, it's a good idea to implement IDisposable to ensure that the service is properly disposed of when it's no longer needed. This can help prevent memory leaks and improve application performance.
In summary, using @implements IDisposable is a good way to share data between components in Blazor, but it's important to properly manage the dispose cycle to avoid memory leaks. Using @bind can also be a good alternative when you need more fine-grained control over the communication between components and a shared service.",0.5690056681632996,"asp.net-core, blazor",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-05',
        'total' =&gt; 0,
    ),

        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-06',

    ),
);

$mergedArray = array_merge($arrayOne, $arrayTwo);


If so, array_filter should work. @Bruce solution was close but it was not testing the value below 480.

$filteredArray = array_filter($mergedArray, function ($val) {
    if (!isset($val['total'])) return true;
    if ($val['total'] &lt; 480) return true;
    return false;
});



","  To remove the array from the Laravel array collection that has a `total` value greater than 480, you can use the `filter()` method and the `where()` method. Here's an example:
```
$arrays = User::select('*')->where('total', '>', 480)->get();
```
In this example, `User` is the model that represents the data in the arrays, and `select('*')` selects all columns, including the `total` column. The `where()` method filters the results to only include records where the `total` value is greater than 480. Finally, the `get()` method returns the filtered array as a Laravel array collection.
Alternatively, you can use the `filter()` method directly on the array collection:
```
$arrays = User::select('*')->filter(function ($user) {
   return $user['total'] > 480;

})->get();

```
In this case, the `filter()` method takes a closure that specifies the condition for filtering the array. In this case, the closure returns true if the `total` value is greater than 480, and false otherwise. The `get()` method returns the filtered array as a Laravel array collection.
You can also use other methods like `whereHas()` or `whereDoesntHave()` to filter the arrays based on other criteria.

and saves data.csv (screenshot from LibreOffice):

","  The issue you're facing is that you're only querying the first page of the API response and notlooping over the `NextPageLink` value to retrieve all the pages. You can fix this by adding a loop that retrieves the next page of data for each iteration of the function. Here's an updated version of your script that should work:
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd 
from timeit import default_timer as timer
from datetime import timedelta

def GetJSON(NextPageLink):
    # Initialize the dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame()

    # Retrieve the API response for the given NextPageLink
    response = requests.get(NextPageLink)
    # Extract the data from the API response
    wjdata = response.json()

    # Add the data to the dataframe
    df = df.append(wjdata)

    # Save the dataframe to a CSV file
    df.to_csv(""test.csv"", index=False)

    # Print the next page link for each iteration
    if 'NextPageLink' in wjdata:
        print(timer(), wjdata['NextPageLink'])

    # Return the NextPageLink for each iteration
    return NextPageLink

# Loop over the NextPageLink values to retrieve all pages
NextPageLinks = []
for page in range(1, 10):  # Adjust the range of pages to fetch
    NextPageLink = ""https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?$skip="" + str(page * 100)
    NextPageLinks.append(NextPageLink)

# Call the function for each NextPageLink value
for NextPageLink in NextPageLinks:
    GetJSON(NextPageLink)

The script now retrieves the data for all pages by iterating over the `NextPageLink` values. It appends each page's data to the existing dataframe and saves it to a CSV file. You can adjust the range of pages to fetch by modifying the `for` loop in the `GetJSON` function.",0.6976480484008789,"python, json, pandas, rest, web-scraping",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

}

","Jackson ObjectMapper cannot create the object, because neither default constructor exists nor any other creator is provided (e.g. @JsonCreator, @ConstructorProperties).
You also have a rate property that is not defined in the Film class, which will cause problems unless you use the @JsonIgnoreProperties annotation (possibly with ignoreUnknown attribute set to true) or configure the ObjectMapper globally (DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES). It could also be that you wanted the likes property to handle that - anyway, it should be fixed.
I've also stumbled upon lack of the jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency, but maybe your project already has it (it's required for the Java 8 classes like LocalDate).

There are different ways to solve the first problem described above, but generally you need to either provide a default constructor or define a creator for Jackson.
If you don't want to expose the default constructor, you can change the settings of the ObjectMapper (for Spring Boot read about Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder) to allow usage of private creators (setVisibility method). In Lombok there's an annotation: @NoArgsConstructor. To limit the visibility, use the access annotation attribute.
The creator can be handled by annotating the constructor with ordered argument names:
@ConstructorProperties({&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;description&quot;, &quot;releaseDate&quot;, &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;genres&quot;, &quot;mpa&quot;, &quot;likes&quot;}). It gets complicated with the Genre and Rating classes as you do not have an explicit access to their constructors. You could either create them and mark appropriately or create a lombok.config file in your project's root directory and inside the file define the property:
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties = true
This way Lombok will automatically add the @ConstructorProperties annotations to the classes.

I've created a GitHub repository with the tests for the solution - you can find it here. The lombok.config file is also included, as well as the fixed Film class.
","  The problem you're facing is due to the nested objects in the JSON body, specifically the `mpa` and `genres` fields. Spring Boot's `@RestController` annotations can only handle simple types in the request body, and cannot handle complex objects with nested structures.
To solve this problem, you have a few options:
1. Use Jackson's `@JsonFormat` annotation to convert the `Rating` and `Genre` objects to a string representation in the JSON body. For example:
```java
public class Film {
    // ...

    @JsonFormat(pattern = ""yyyy-MM-dd"")
    private LocalDate releaseDate;
    @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING)
    private Rating mpa;

    @JsonFormat(pattern = ""yyyy-MM-dd"")
    private List<Genre> genres;
}
```
This will convert the `Rating` and `Genre` objects to a string representation in the JSON body, making them serializable. However, this may not be ideal if you need to work with these objects directly in your code.
2. Use Spring Boot's built-in support for handling complex objects in the request body. Spring Boot provides a feature called ""supporting custom payload formats"" that allows you to define a custom payload format for handling complex objects in the request body. You can configure this feature by adding the following annotation to your `Film` class:
```java
@SupportsCustomPayloadFormat
public class Film {
    // ...

}
```
Then, you can define a `PayloadFormat` annotation on your `Film` class to specify the custom payload format:
```java
@PayloadFormat(name = ""film"", supports = PayloadFormat.Supported.JSON, mapper = FilmMapper.class)
public class Film {
    // ...

}

```
This will allow Spring Boot to handle the complex objects in the request body as a custom payload format, rather than trying to serialize them as a string. You can then use a `@RequestBody` annotation on a method to read the request body and extract the data:
```java
@GetMapping(value = ""/films"")
public List<Film> getFilms(@RequestBody Film film) {
    // ...

}
```
3. Use a third-party library like Jackson's `Serialization Processor` to handle the nested objects in the request body. This can be a more complex solution, but it allows you to handle any type of object in the request body, including nested objects. You can configure this feature by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file ( assuming you're using Maven ):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.2</version>
</dependency>
```
Then, you can use the `SerializationProcessor` to handle the nested objects in the request body:
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializationProcessor;
public class Film {
    // ...

    @SerializationProcessor(new Filmserializer())

    public Film(long id, String name, @NonNull String description, @NonNull LocalDate releaseDate, @NonNull int duration, List<Genre> genres, Rating mpa, Set<Long> likes) {
        // ...

    }

    private static class Filmserializer implements SerializationProcessor<Film> {
        @Override
        public void serialize(Object value, JsonGenerator json, SerializationWriter serializationWriter) throws IOException {
            Film film = (Film) value;
            json.writeStartObject();
            json.writeStringField(""id"", film.getId());
            json.writeStringField(""name"", film.getName());
            json.writeStringField(""description"", film.getDescription());
            json.writeStringField(""releaseDate"", film.getReleaseDate().toString());
            json.writeIntField(""duration"", film.getDuration());
            json.writeStartArray(""genres"");
            for (Genre genre : film.getGenres()) {
                json.writeObjectStart();
                json.writeStringField(""id"", genre.getId());
                json.writeStringField(""name"", genre.getName());
                json.writeObjectEnd();
            }
            json.writeEndArray();
            json.writeStartArray(""mpa"");
            Rating mpa = film.getMpa();
            json.writeObjectStart();
            json.writeStringField(""id"", mpa.getId());
            json.writeStringField(""name"", mpa.getName());
            json.writeObjectEnd();
            json.writeEndArray();
            json.writeStartArray(""likes"");
            for (Long like : film.getLikes()) {
                json.writeObjectStart();
                json.writeStringField(""id"", like.toString());
                json.writeObjectEnd();
            }
            json.writeEndArray();

        }
    }
```
This will allow you to handle the nested objects in the request body by using a custom serialization processor.
In conclusion, the best solution depends on your specific use case and requirements. From the options above, option 2 is the most straightforward and easy to implement, while option 3 is more complex but provides more flexibility and control over the serialization process.",0.6475878953933716,"java, spring-boot",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","You have packages that are way out of date. You need to 1) update your packages and 2) go back to the firebase documentation for flutter and follow the suggested steps since you are also missing firebase_core which is needed to use firebase_auth and cloud_firestore in your project.
","  The issue you're encountering is related to the `com.google.android.gms` dependency, specifically the `play-services-measurement-base` module. It seems that Gradle is having trouble finding the metadata for this module, which is causing the build to fail.
To fix this issue, you can try the following:
1. Check your internet connection: Make sure you have a stable internet connection, as Gradle may need to download metadata from the Google Bintray repository.
2. Use an older version of `play-services-measurement-base`: If you're using a newer version of the `play-services-measurement-base` module (e.g., `21.1.1`), try using an older version (e.g., `19.1.0`) in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
3. Use the `maven-metadata` plugin: You can use the `maven-metadata` plugin to download the metadata for the `play-services-measurement-base` module. This can be done by adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:
```bash
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/' }
    }

dependencies {
        classpath 'org.gradle:maven-metadata:4.2'
    }
}
```
4. Disable the `checkOnly` option: By default, Gradle will check the metadata for dependencies but not download it. You can disable this option by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
publish_to: 'none'

version: 1.0.0+1

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cloud_firestore: ^0.13.5
  firebase_auth: 0.16.1
  image_picker: ^0.6.5+3
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  change_app_package_name: ^0.1.3

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

.
checkOnly: false

```
By doing this, Gradle won't check the metadata for the `play-services-measurement-base` module, and the build will be successful.
5. Update Gradle: Make sure you're using the latest version of Gradle, as the issue might be fixed in a newer version. You can check the latest version of Gradle and update it by running the following command in your terminal:
```

gradle --version

```

These are some potential solutions to the issue you're facing. If none of them work, please provide more information about your project and the exact error message you're encountering, so I can assist you further.",0.3431392312049866,"flutter, gradle, build.gradle, pubspec, flutter-doctor",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73211933,Extending short key for AES256 (SNMPv3),"I am currently working on security of a switch that runs SNMPv3.
I am expected to code it in such a way, that any SHA (1 - 2-512) is compatible with any AES (128 - 256C).
Everything, like the algorithms alone, works pretty well. The problem is, that its been estabilished, that we are going to use SHA for key generation for both authentification and encryption.
When I want to use, let's say, SHA512 with AES256, there's no problem, since SHA has output of 64B and I need just 32B for key for AES256.
But when I want to use SHA1 with AES256, SHA1 produces only 20B, which is insufficient for the key.
I've searched the internet through and through and I found out, that it's common to use this combination (snmpget, openssl), but I havent found a single word about how are you supposed to prolong the key.
How can I extend the key from 20B to 32B so it works?
P. S.: Yes, I know SHA isn't KDF, yes, I know it's not that common to use this combination, but this is just how it is in my job assignment.
","Here is a page discussing your exact question. In short, there is no standard way to do this (as you have already discovered), however, Cisco has adopted the approach outlined in section 2.1 of this document:

Chaining is described as follows.  First, run the password-to-key algorithm with inputs of the passphrase and engineID as described in the USM document.  This will output as many key bits as the hash algorithm used to implement the password-to-key algorithm.  Secondly, run the password-to-key algorithm again with the previous output (instead of the passphrase) and the same engineID as inputs.  Repeat this process as many times as necessary in order to generate the minimum number of key bits for the chosen privacy protocol.  The outputs of each execution are concatenated into a single string of key bits.
When this process results in more key bits than are necessary, only the most significant bits of the string should be used.
For example, if password-to-key implemented with SHA creates a 40-octet string string for use as key bits, only the first 32 octets will be used for usm3DESEDEPrivProtocol.

","  Ah, I see. In SNMPv3, the SHA hash function is used to generate both the authentication and encryption keys. When using a short SHA hash function (such as SHA-1) with a long AES key (such as AES-256), you will indeed run into the issue of the SHA output size being too small for the AES key.
One solution to this problem is to use a key stretching algorithm, which can be applied to the SHA output to increase its size. The most commonly used key stretching algorithm in this context is the block cipher modes of operation, such as Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation.
By using a block cipher mode of operation, you can combine the SHA output with random padding to increase its size to the required 32 bytes for AES-256. Here's an example of how this could be implemented in SnMPget and OpenSSL:
SnMPget Code:
// Generate the SHA-1 hash of the authentication key
$authKey = ""my-auth-key"";
$digest = snmpget_hash(""sha1"", $authKey);
// Generate the random padding to stretch the output to 32 bytes
$padding = openssl_random_nonce(32);
// Combine the SHA output and the padding, and encrypt it with AES-256
$cipherText = $digest . $padding;
$encryptedData = aes_encrypt($cipherText, ""my-aes-key"");
// Send the encrypted data over the network
send_snmp_data($encryptedData);
OpenSSL Code:
// Define the SHA-1 hash function
$hash = new MD5();
// Generate the SHA-1 hash of the authentication key
$authKey = ""my-auth-key"";
$digest = $hash->hash($authKey);
// Generate the random padding to stretch the output to 32 bytes
$padding = openssl_random_nonce(32);
// Combine the SHA output and the padding, and encrypt it with AES-256
$cipherText = $digest . $padding;
// Set the AES key
$aesKey = ""my-aes-key"";
// Encrypt the data

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To remove words from a string based on a list in Google Sheets, you can use a combination of the `REGEXREPLACE` and `FILTER` functions. Here's how you can do it:
1. In the cell where you want to apply the function, enter the following formula:
=REGEXREPLACE(A1, ""(?:^|, ){1,}$"", B1)
In this formula:
* `A1` is the cell containing the string you want to modify.
* `B1` is the list of words you want to remove from the string.
* `(?:^|, ){1,}` is a regular expression pattern that matches any word from the list. The `(?:...)` part is called a non-capturing group, which means that the words matched inside the group are not included in the replacement string. The `^` at the beginning and end of the pattern match the start and end of the string, and the `, ` at the end of the pattern matches any comma that may be present in the string. The `{1,}` after the `, ` specifies that the pattern should match at least one of the words in the list.
2. Replace the string `B1` in the formula with the list of words you want to remove from the string.
3. Press Enter to apply the formula and see the results.
Here's an example of how the formula works:
* Suppose you have the string ""Apple, Orange, Banana"" in cell A1, and the list of words you want to remove is in cell B1, which contains the words ""Orange"" and ""Banana"". When you enter the formula =REGEXREPLACE(A1, ""(?:^|, ){1,}$"", B1), the formula will replace the words ""Orange"" and ""Banana"" in the string ""Apple, Orange, Banana"" with empty strings, leaving you with the string ""Apple"".

74132943,spring mockito: when an object containing a list is an argument,"The issue is that the list of ids within the pageRequest object can be in any order. Is there a way to specify that below? The test fails since the pageRequest has a list of ids in a different order than the one specified below. The &quot;when&quot; clause returns null in that case.
PageRequest pageRequest = PageRequest.builder()
                .ids(List.of(serviceId2, serviceId1, serviceId3))
                .build();
 when(client.getServices(eq(pageRequest))).thenAnswer(a -&gt; {.......

","You can implement a custom ArgumentMatcher to define the matching logic and then use argThat with this ArgumentMatcher during stubbing :
@Test
public void test(){
        when(someMock.getSerivce(argThat(pageRequestContainId(List.of(1,4,5,6))))).thenReturn(blablabla);
}

private ArgumentMatcher&lt;PageRequest&gt; pageRequestContainId(List&lt;Integer&gt; ids) {
        return pageReq -&gt; pageReq.ids.containsAll(ids) &amp;&amp; pageReq.ids.size() == ids.size();
}


","  Ah, I see the issue! In your `SpringMockito` code, you are using the `when` clause to stub the `client.getServices()` method with a specific `PageResponse`. However, the issue is that the list of service IDs within the `PageRequest` object is not consistent with the order in which they are being passed to the `when` clause.
To fix this issue, you can use the `any()` method in the `when` clause to make the mock implementation more flexible. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:
PageRequest pageRequest = PageRequest.builder()
            .ids(List.of(serviceId2, serviceId1, serviceId3))
            .build();
When(client.getServices(any(PageRequest.class))).thenAnswer(a -&gt; {.......

In this updated code, the `any()` method is used in the `when` clause to make the mock implementation take any `PageRequest` object as an argument, regardless of the order of the service IDs in the list. This should make the test pass, as the list of service IDs in the `PageRequest` object can be in any order.
Alternatively, you could also use the `Any` type in the `when` clause, like this:
When(client.getServices(any(Any.class))).thenAnswer(a -&gt; {.......
This will also make the mock implementation more flexible and able to handle any `PageRequest` object.

**[0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]**

of occupied and unoccupied seats, where 1 indicated occupied and 0 indicated unoccupied, we have return the maximum maximum number of people who can be seated  as long  as there is a gap  of **2 seats **between people.
I trid a sliding window approac but it didnt worked
`
// maxim seats question

// [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]

function cinSeating(array) {
  let seats = 0;

  for (let p1 = 0, p2 = 3; p1, p2 &lt;= array.length; p1++, p2++) {
    if (array[p1] !== array[p2]) {
      seats++;
    }
  }
  return seats;
}

console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]));


`
","Try using dynamic programming to solve this problem.
Basic approach:

Parse through the array one by one recursively
At every point, check if that seat can be filled in or not. At this point, you can take either one of the two options - YES or NO
If YES - increment the total count and call the same function with the next index and incremented count
If YES - call the same function with the next index and existing count
Find out the max between the two calculations and return the answer

Code will look something like this:
function hasAPerson(array, index){
    // Utility function to encapsulate all the checks while checking the next index for possible vacant seat
    if(index &gt;= array.length){
        return false;
    }
    
    else return array[index] === 1;
}

function cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index) {
  let newlyAdded = 0;

  if(index &gt;= array.length){
      return existingNumber;
  }

  if(array[index] === 1){
      return cinSeating(array, existingNumber, index, index + 1);
  }
  
  let excludeCurrentSeat = currentValue = cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index + 1);
  
  let includeCurrentSeat = existingNumber;
  
  //Check if last leftIndex with 1 is beyond index-2
  if(leftIndex &lt; index-2){
      
      let next = index+1;
      let nextToNext = next+1;
      
      //Check if next or next to next index has any 1
      if(!hasAPerson(array, next) &amp;&amp; !hasAPerson(array, nextToNext)){
          includeCurrentSeat = cinSeating(array, existingNumber + 1, index, index+1);
      }
  }
  
  return Math.max(currentValue, includeCurrentSeat);
}

You can call the cinSeating function with the following arguments:

input array

existing number of people (seats already booked) - basically number of 1s in the array

last left index that had 1. When we start we can pass -3 so that left check gets passed

index to process
console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 2, -3, 0));


This is something that I wrote quickly to illustrate my approach. This code can definitely be optimised. Feel free to play around with it
","  Sure! I can help you with that. The problem you're trying to solve is known as the ""Cinema Seating"" problem, which is a classic example of a ""gap filling"" problem. The goal is to find the maximum number of people that can be seated in a row in a cinema, subject to certain constraints.
Here's how you can solve this problem using a sliding window approach:
1. Define two variables `left` and `right` to keep track of the indices of the occupied and unoccupied seats, respectively. Initialize `left` and `right` to 0.
2. Initialize a third variable `gap` to 0, which will keep track of the maximum gap between any two occupied seats.
3. In each iteration of the loop, compare the value of `array[left]` with the value of `array[right]`. If they are different, update `gap` to the minimum of `gap` and the distance between `left` and `right`. Then, update `left` and `right` accordingly to ensure that there is a gap of at least `gap` between any two occupied seats.
4. After each iteration, update `seats` by count the number of occupied seats between `left` and `right`.
Here's the JavaScript code for the above approach:
```js
function cinSeating(array) {
  let seats = 0;
  for (let p1 = 0, p2 = 3; p1, p2 <= array.length; p1++, p2++) {
    if (array[p1] !== array[p2]) {
      seats++;
    }
    let gap = Math.min(gap, (p2 - p1) + 1);

    gap = Math.min(gap, (array[p1] ? array[p2] - array[p1] : 0));

    left = p1 + 1;
    right = p2 + 1;

  }
  return seats;
}

console.log(cinSeatting([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]));
```
In the above code, the `gap` variable is updated in each iteration to keep track of the maximum gap between any two occupied seats. The `left` and `right` variables are used to keep track of the indices of the occupied seats, and are updated accordingly to ensure that there is a gap of at least `gap` between any two occupied seats.
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we are scanning the array once to find the maximum number of occupied seats.

    await state.finish()

",".fetchall() method will return a list of tuples for the table you are querying. In this case, your query deletes the records so it is possibly returning an empty tuple. You need a SELECT query for fetchall() to return any results. If you want to see if the record was successfully deleted, you can run the following after the delete query:
cursor.execute(f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE code=&quot;{item}&quot;')
check_code = cursor.fetchall()

If this doesn't return anything, then you know that the record was deleted.
","  The issue you're facing is caused by the fact that the `check_code` tuple has a length of 0, which means that there is no match for the item in the database. This is causing the ` IndexError: tuple index out of range` to occur.
To fix this, you can simply check the length of `check_code` before accessing its elements:
```
if len(check_code) == 0:
    # handle the case where there is no match in the database
else:
    # handle the case where there is a match in the database
```
Also, you can use `cursor.execute()` with a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks:
```
cursor.execute(f'DELETE FROM users WHERE code=?', (item,))
```
This will render the `item` variable as a parameterized query, rather than as a raw string, which can help prevent SQL injection attacks.
In addition, you may want to consider handling the case where there is no match in the database gracefully, rather than raising an error. For example, you could return a message indicating that the user was not found in the database.
Finally, you may want to consider using a more robust and flexible approach to handling the deletion of users, rather than relying on a hardcoded SQL query. For example, you could use a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, such as SQLAlchemy, to interact with the database. This can make it easier to perform complex database operations, such as deleting users, in a more robust and scalable way.",0.7426750659942627,"python, mysql",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74237232,Typescript string union of object values as constants,"If I have an array of objects, how can I get a property of each object and create string union of its constant value? For example, below I have the array options. I want to create a type like type Values = 'firstName' | 'lastName' | 'email'.
const options = [
  { label: 'First Name', value: 'firstName' }, 
  { label: 'Last Name', value: 'lastName' },
  { label: 'Email', value: 'email' }
] as const;

// Close, but not quite what I need
const values = options.map(x =&gt; x.value) // (&quot;firstName&quot;|&quot;lastName&quot;|&quot;email&quot;)[]

","You'll be able to retrieve the type by using typeof and indexing into the array type with number:
type Values = (typeof values)[number];

Please note that typeof behaves differently when used in this context. It gets the type of a variable; in this case it's values that has a type of (&quot;firstName&quot; | &quot;lastName&quot; | &quot;email&quot;)[].
Playground
","  To create a string union of the constant values of an array of objects, you can use the `infer` keyword in TypeScript to imply a type for each property of each object in the array. Here's an example:
```
const options = [
  { label: 'First Name', value: 'firstName' },
  { label: 'Last Name', value: 'lastName' },
  { label: 'Email', value: 'email' }
] as const;

type Values =keyof (typeof options)[] & { [K in keyof options]: options[K].value };
const values = options.map(x => x.label) as string[];
console.log(values); // Output: [""firstName"" ""lastName"" ""email""]
```
In this example, the `keyof` operator is used to get an array of keys from the `options` array, and then the `infer` keyword is used to imply a type for each property of each object in the array. The `infer` type is a union of all the property values of each object in the array.
The `as string[]` part is used to convert the `values` variable to a `string` array.
Note that you can also use the `as const` when using `map` to avoid losing the type information, as you've done in the last line of the code snippet.
Alternatively, you can also use the `Object.values()` method to get an array of all the property values of each object in the array, and then use the `reduce()` method to create the string union:
```
const options = [
  { label: 'First Name', value: 'firstName' },
  { label: 'Last Name', value: 'lastName' },
  { label: 'Email', value: 'email' }
] as const;

const values = Object.values(options).reduce((a, b) => a.concat(b), []) as string[];
console.log(values); // Output: [""firstName"" ""lastName"" ""email""]
```
In this case, the `Object.values()` method gets an array of all the property values of each object in the array, and then the `reduce()` method is used to create a new array by concatenating all the property values with each other. The resulting array is then cast to a `string[]` using the `as` keyword.
Both of these approaches will give you the same result, which is a `string[]` array containing the constant values of each object in the `options` array.",0.4959118962287903,"typescript, typescript-typings, react-typescript",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

}

Pragma directive:
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
    }

Now the problem is that if I put the directive above to make the code parallel around the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep call (marked with the comment --1-- in the code) I get much better times (around 9.6/9.7 seconds for that code section) vs if I put it around the for marked in the code with --2-- comment, so getting the whole function code but the malloc (times 12.7/12.8 seconds).
I've executed the code 3 times for each to make sure it wasn't a fluke and with the same number of threads (6 in this case).
I'm running on my university machine which supposedly should not have any other program running at the same time as mine for the allocated resources.
The reason why I believe this behaviour is strange is that inside the pragma omp single region I expect one single thread to execute the code, so I don't think having the malloc inside or outside the region should lead to such a difference.
Also the code gives the same result and is run with the same input.
","The problem, as mentioned by @JohnBollinger in the comments, was due to the fact that when I put the pragma as below, the thread that executed the #pragma omp single region could get to the free(dep_matrix) before the other threads had ended.
#ifdef PAR_PC
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
        parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(n, 0, n, 0, n, 0, n, Ax, w);
    }
#else

By putting pragma inside the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep function like below, the thread executing the #pragma omp single region has to wait for the other threads at the end of the region (i.e. before the free(dep_matrix)), and so the matrix is still available when the other threads need it.
void parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(int n, int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2, int k1, int k2, double *restrict Ax, double w)

","  It seems that the execution time of your parallel code depends on where you put the OpenMP directives. This is not uncommon and can be caused by several factors, including:
1. Race conditions: When you use OpenMP, multiple threads can access shared variables simultaneously. If you don't use proper synchronization mechanisms, race conditions can occur, leading to unpredictable behavior and slowdowns.
2. Cache hierarchy effects: The performance of your code might be affected by the cache hierarchy of your CPU. If the critical sections of your code are not properly aligned with the cache boundaries, the performance might suffer.
3. Memory synchronization: When you use OpenMP, you need to ensure that memory is properly synchronized between threads. If you don't use proper synchronization mechanisms, you might experience race conditions or other memory-related issues that can lead to slowdowns.
4. Synchronization overhead: If you use too many synchronization points or if the synchronization points are not properly optimized, the overhead can add up and slow down your code.
5. Thread overhead: The creation and management of OpenMP threads can introduce additional overhead, which can be amplified if you have a large number of threads.

To optimize your code, you could try some of the following techniques:
1. Use proper synchronization mechanisms: Make sure you use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or barriers, to avoid race conditions and ensure that shared variables are accessed correctly by multiple threads.
2. Align critical sections with cache boundaries: Ensure that the critical sections of your code are properly aligned with the cache boundaries to minimize cache hierarchy effects.
3. Use parallel regions appropriately: Use the `#pragma omp parallel` directive only where necessary, and make sure that the regions where you use it are well-defined and have minimal synchronization overhead.
4. Minimize synchronization overhead: Use minimal synchronization points and optimize the synchronization mechanism to minimize overhead.
5. Use data parallelism: Instead of using OpenMP tasks to parallelize the entire code, consider using data parallelism techniques that can take advantage of the GPU or other accelerators. This can help reduce the number of threads and minimize synchronization overhead.

By applying these techniques and optimizing your code, you can improve the performance of your parallel code and reduce the execution time.",0.4598334729671478,"c, openmp, timing",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74214976,How do you sort input in Python?,"beginning coder here. I was trying to sort words and numbers, and it mostly work. However, when I provided input to sort, it doesn't seem to work.
I tried inserting the input as a variable and it broke the numbers down into single digits, which I did not want to do. I tried converting the input into a float and integers and it did not work. I tried
input1 = input() #I input in 23, 12, 45
sorted(input1)

And I got
[' ', ' ', ',', ',', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5']

I was expecting for it to sort by whole numbers without being broken down.
","If your input is a String, you can convert it to int and add to a list.
Then you can sort the list:
list =  []
x = input(&quot;write:&quot;)
x = x.replace(&quot; &quot;,&quot;&quot;)
y = x.split(&quot;,&quot;)
for i in y:
    if i.isnumeric():
        i = int(i)
        list.append(i)
list.sort()
print(list)

","  Ah, I see the issue. When you use `input()` to read user input, it returns a string. In your case, the input string is ""23, 12, 45"". To sort this string, you can use the `sorted()` function, but you need to convert the string to a list first.
Here's an updated code snippet that should work:
`input1 = input()` #I input in 23, 12, 45
sorted(list(input1)) #list() turns the string into a list

In this code, we first use `input()` to read the user input, then we convert the string to a list using `list()`. Finally, we use `sorted()` to sort the list.
Note that when you use `input()`, it returns a string by default. So, when you pass this string to `sorted()`, it will sort the individual characters in the string, which is what you mentioned did not want to happen. By converting the string to a list first, we can avoid this issue and get the desired output.
Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",0.6622099876403809,"python, sorting",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","If the button starts a counter from 0 to lastStep, then you need more than useState:

  );
};

The code can be tested here.
","  The issue you're facing is that you're using `setTimeout` to update the state with a delay, but `setTimeout` only sets a delay for the function it's called in, not for the state update.
To achieve the behavior you described, you can use the `useEffect` hook with a delayed dependency. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to do this:
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
const Step counter = useState(0);
const handleReplay = () => {
  const handleStep = () => {
      const currentStep = counter.current;
      // Update the state with a delay
      setTimeout(() => {
        counter.current = currentStep + 1;
        }, 500);
    };

  useEffect(() => {

    for (let i = 0; i < lastStep; i++) {
      handleStep();
      }, [counter]);
  }, []);
```
In this example, we've added a new function `handleStep` that updates the state with a delay using `setTimeout`. We've also added a new dependency to the `useEffect` hook, `counter`, which is the state we're trying to update.
The `useEffect` hook with the delayed dependency will only run once, when the component mounts, and then will not run again until the `counter` state changes. This means that the `handleStep` function will only run once, when the component mounts, and then will run repeatedly with a delay of 500 milliseconds each time the `counter` state changes.
You can also use `useCallback` to memoize the `handleStep` function and make it reusable.
```
const handleReplay = useCallback((props) => {
  const handleStep = () => {
      const currentStep = props.counter.current;
      // Update the state with a delay
      setTimeout(() => {
        props.counter.current = currentStep + 1;
        }, 500);
    };

  useEffect(() => {

    for (let i = 0; i < lastStep; i++) {
      handleStep();
      }, [props.counter]);
  }, [props.counter]);
```
This way, you can pass the `counter` state as a prop to the `handleStep` function and use it to update the state with a delay.

https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage
","  The error message you're seeing indicates that `AsyncStorage` is not able to retrieve the token from storage. This is likely because the token is not being saved correctly.
Here are some things you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the token value: Make sure that the token value is being set correctly in the `getData` function. You can use `console.log(token)` to check the value of `token` after it's being set.
2. Check the storage method: Make sure that you're using the correct method to store the token. In this case, you're using `AsyncStorage`, which is a async storage module for React Native.
3. Check the storage location: Make sure that the token is being saved in the correct location in the storage. By default, `AsyncStorage` saves data in the `async_storage` directory in the app's sandbox directory.
4. Check the app's configuration: Make sure that the app's configuration file has the correct storage directory. You can check this by running `react-native config` in your terminal.
5. Check for typos: Make sure that there are no typos in the token value or the storage location.
6. Check if the token is invalid: If the token is invalid, it will not be able to be retrieved from storage. Make sure that the token is valid and that it's being generated correctly in the `auth` function.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Use `console.log(token)` to check the value of `token` after it's being set in the `getData` function. This will allow you to see if the token is being set correctly.
2. Use `AsyncStorage.setItem` instead of `AsyncStorage.getItem` to set the token in storage. This may fix the issue if the token is not being saved correctly.
3. Check the storage method: Make sure that you're using the correct method to store the token.
4. Check the storage location: Make sure that the token is being saved in the correct location in the storage.
5. Check the app's configuration: Make sure that the app's configuration file has the correct storage directory.
6. Check for typos: Make sure that there are no typos in the token value or the storage location.

By trying these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to determine the cause of the issue and fix it.

Update from comment:
So I extracted the view as follows for now
struct ExtractedView: View {
  @State private var editNoteContent: String = &quot;&quot;
  @FocusState private var editNoteIsFocused: Bool
  @State private var editNote: Note? = nil
  
  func editExistingNote(note: Note?) {

    note.content = editNoteContent
    PersistenceController.shared.save()
    editNoteContent = &quot;&quot;
    editNoteIsFocused = false
    editNote = nil
  }

But I dont understand how to call it. If I call it with ExtractedView() then the code compiles and the app runs, but it crashes when I enter this path of the app. And when I call it like this:
ExtractedView(
  editNoteContent: editNoteContent,
  editNoteIsFocused: editNoteIsFocused,
  editNote: editNote
)

Then i get lots of errors ... 
","Thanks to the comments and this answer here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682448 I got it to work. I extracted the view as follows:
struct EditNoteView: View {
  
  @Binding var noteContent: String
  @FocusState var isNoteFocused: Bool
  var onsubmit: () -&gt; ()
  var placeholder: String
  
  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      TextField(placeholder, text: $noteContent)
        .onSubmit(onsubmit)
        .focused($isNoteFocused)
      if (!noteContent.isEmpty) {
        Button(action: onsubmit) {
          Image(systemName: &quot;checkmark&quot;)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

and then I call this child view from my parent view (inside the body) with
EditNoteView(
  noteContent: $newNoteContent,
  isNoteFocused: _newNoteIsFocused,
  onsubmit: submitNewNote,
  placeholder: &quot;New Note&quot;
)

Also in my parent views, I have the following definitions for the variables
@State private var newNoteContent: String = &quot;&quot;
@FocusState private var newNoteIsFocused: Bool
func submitNewNote() {
    Note.add(content: newNoteContent)
    newNoteContent = &quot;&quot;
    newNoteIsFocused = false
  }

The main takeaways is that all of the @State things map to @Binding in the childview, and the @FocusState maps to another @FocusState, but there is a _ required before the parameter in the call.
","  Great, thanks for providing more details on your code and the problems you're facing! 😊
To extract the `editCell` function as a separate view, you can create a new `struct` or `class` that wraps the `HStack` and its associated bindings. Here's an example of how you can do this:
1. Create a new `struct` named `EditView` that takes the same parameters as the `editCell` function:
``` Swift
struct EditView: View {
  @State private var editNoteContent: String = """"
  @FocusState private var editNoteIsFocused: Bool = false
  @State private var editNote: Note? = nil

  func editExistingNote(note: Note?) {
    guard let note else { return }
    note.content = editNoteContent
    PersistenceController.shared.save()
    editNoteContent = """"
    editNoteIsFocused = false
    editNote = nil
  }

  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      TextField(""New Note"", text: $editNoteContent)
        .onSubmit {
          self.editExistingNote(note: $0)
        }
        .focused($editNoteIsFocused)

        if !editNoteContent.isEmpty {
          Button(action: {
            self.editExistingNote(note: nil)
          }) {
            Image(systemName: ""checkmark"")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
In this `EditView` struct, we've defined the same `editNoteContent`, `editNoteIsFocused`, and `editNote` bindings as in the original `editCell` function. We've also defined a new `editExistingNote` function that performs the same action as the original `submitNewNote` function, but with better parameter handling.
Finally, in the `body` property, we've wrapped the `HStack` with a `some View` closure to ensure that the view is properly rendered.
1. Call the `EditView` function in your main code to create the view:
``` Swift
func main() {
  let view = EditView()

  print(""Done!"")

  runApp(view)

}
```
This should create the `EditView` view and render it in your app. You can then use this `EditView` view in other parts of your app by calling it and passing in the appropriate parameters.

","Here are some reasons why you can lose state in child (there could be more, but these apply to you most):
    {displayMyChild &amp;&amp; &lt;MyChildCmp validationCallback={validationCallback}/&gt;}

Here if at one point displayMyChild is truthy, then made falsy, this means the component MyChildCmp will get unmounted, hence all its state will be gone.
But now, even if you didn't have that condition and rendered the MyChildCmp always you would still run into similar problem, this is because you defined MyChildCmp inside another component. When you do that, on each render of the parent component, the function MyChildCmp is recreated, and the reconciliation algorithm of react thinks you rendered a different component type on next render, so it will destroy the component instance. Move definition of that component outside the parent component.
","  The issue you're encountering is that the state of the child component is not being updated properly when the parent component re-renders. This is because the `useState` hook in React is a pure function, meaning that it doesn't have a side effect and doesn't mutate state outside of its own scope.
In your case, you're trying to update the state of the child component inside the `useEffect` hook of the parent component, but `useEffect` only runs on mount and not on re-renders. So when the parent component re-renders, the state of the child component is not being updated.
To solve this issue, you can use the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `validationCallback` function. This will ensure that the `validationCallback` function is only re-created when the child component's state changes, rather than on every re-render of the parent component.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `useCallback`:
```javascript
function ParentComp(props) {
    const [companyIcon, setCompanyIcon] = useState({ name: ""icon"", value: """" });

    const validationCallback = useCallback((tabId, hasError) => {
        if (hasError) {
            setCompanyIcon(prevItem => ({ ...prevItem, value: ""error""}));
            // Update the state of the child component here
        }
    }, [companyIcon]);

    const MyChildCmp = (props) => {
        const [myAddress, setmyAddress] = useState("""");

        useEffect(() => {
            if (myAddressExceptions.length > 0) {
                props.validationCallback('MyInfo', true);
            } else {
                props.validationCallback('MyInfo', false);
            }
        }, [myAddressExceptions]);

        const handlemyAddressChange = (event) => {
            // Set the state of the child component here
            setmyAddress(event.target.value);
            // Update the state of the parent component here
        };

        return (
            <div className=""row"" style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', width: '1000px'}}>

                <div style={{ width: '20%'}}>

                        validationState={
                            myAddressExceptions[0] ? myAddressExceptions[0].type : ''
                        }

                            onChange={handlemyAddressChange}
                            onBlur={handleBlur}

    );
}

export default withRouter(ParentComp);
```
In this modified code, the `validationCallback` function is created using `useCallback`, which ensures that the function is only re-created when the child component's state changes. This should solve the issue of the state of the child component being lost after the parent component re-renders.
Note that I've also removed the `validationState` property from the `MyChildCmp` component, since it's no longer necessary.",0.5720138549804688,"javascript, reactjs, react-hooks, use-effect, use-state",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I've already seen the following post: Test expected exceptions in Kotlin
","Inside class CarDefects, you're having this init block:

Hence, the exception will be thrown during construction.

        }
    }
}

","  The issue you're facing is that in Kotlin, when you use `assertFailsWith` to expect an exception of a specific type, the exception must be thrown by the code you're testing, and not by any other code in the test.
In your case, when you call `validateDefectCode(defect.getDefectCode())` in the first test, it throws an `InvalidDefectCodeException` with the message ""Defect code must be 4 characters long"". However, when you call `validateDefectCode(defect2.getDefectCode())` in the second test, it does not throw an exception, because the defect code ""122F4"" is valid and does not trigger the validateDefectCode method to throw an exception.
To fix this issue, you can modify your tests to use a different approach to test the validateDefectCode method. One way is to use a mocking library like Mockk to mock the validateDefectCode method and verify that it is called with the expected values.
Here's an example of how you can modify your tests using Mockk:
import car.exceptions.InvalidDefectCodeException
import car.validators.carDefectsValidators.validateDefectCode
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import org.mockk.MockK Annex
import kotlin.test.assertFires

    val carModel2 = CarModel(Brand.AUDI, &quot;X434&quot;, 199219)

    val defect = CarDefects(carModel, listOf(Year.of(2020), Year.of(2021)), &quot;SE2@&quot;)
    val defect2 = CarDefects(carModel2, listOf(Year.of(2020), Year.of(2021)), &quot;122F4&quot;)

    @Test
    fun testDefectCodeExceptions() {

        // Mock the validateDefectCode method to throw an exception
        val mockValidator = mockk<CarDefectsValidators.Validator>(relaxed = true)
        every { mockValidator.validateDefectCode(any()) } returns InvalidDefectCodeException(any(), any())
        val exception = Assertions.assertThrows(InvalidDefectCodeException::class.java) {
            validateDefectCode(defect.getDefectCode())
        }
    }

    @Test
    fun testDefectCodeExceptions2() {

        // Mock the validateDefectCode method to return without throwing an exception
        val mockValidator = mockk<CarDefectsValidators.Validator>(relaxed = true)
        every { mockValidator.validateDefectCode(any()) } returns empty()
        Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow {
            validateDefectCode(defect2.getDefectCode())
        }
    }
}

In this modified version of your test, you use Mockk to mock the `CarDefectsValidators.Validator` class, and specify the behavior of the `validateDefectCode` method using the `every` function. In the first test, you expect the `validateDefectCode` method to throw an `InvalidDefectCodeException` with a specific message, and in the second test, you expect it to return without throwing an exception.
By using this approach, you can test the `validateDefectCode` method without relying on the actual implementation of the exception, and ensure that it behaves as expected regardless of the implementation details of the `InvalidDefectCodeException` class.",0.7407042980194092,kotlin,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    return &quot;No further details!&quot;;
else
    return e.getMessage();

whereas
return &quot;Unexpected Error: &quot; + (e.getMessage() == null ? &quot;No further details!&quot; : e.getMessage());

    return &quot;Unexpected Error: &quot; + &quot;No further details!&quot;;
else
    return &quot;Unexpected Error: &quot; + e.getMessage();

I hope it clears your doubt.
","  Ah, I see! The issue you're facing is related to Java operator precedence and the way the ternary operator works.
In the first code snippet, there are no parentheses around the ternary expression, which means that the operator precedence is correct. Specifically, in Java, the ternary operator has a higher precedence than the assignment operator (=''). Therefore, the evaluation of the ternary expression is performed first, and then the result is assigned to the variable 'e.getMessage()'.
Here's the step-by-step evaluation of the code:
1. e.getMessage() is called and returns an exception message.
2. The ternary expression is evaluated: e.getMessage() == null ? ""No further details!"" : e.getMessage();
3. The result of the ternary expression is assigned to 'e.getMessage()': e.getMessage() = ""No further details!"" (if the condition in the ternary expression is true) or e.getMessage() (if the condition is false).
4. The string literal ""Unexpected Error: "" is concatenated with the assigned value of 'e.getMessage()'.
So, in your first code snippet, the result of the ternary expression is assigned to 'e.getMessage()', which is why you see the correct output for an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
However, in the second code snippet, there are no parentheses around the ternary expression, which means that the assignment has higher precedence than the ternary operator. Therefore, the assignment of the result of the ternary expression to 'e.getMessage()' happens first, and then the ternary expression is evaluated. This is why you see the incorrect output for an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
To fix the issue, you can either add parentheses around the ternary expression to make its precedence clear, or use the && operator instead of the ternary operator to ensure that the expression is evaluated first. Here are the modified code snippets:
Snippet 1 (correct):
return ""Unexpected Error: "" + (e.getMessage() == null ? ""No further details!"" : e.getMessage());
Snippet 2 (incorrect):
return ""Unexpected Error: "" + (e.getMessage() == null ? ""No further details!"" : e.getMessage());
In snippet 2, the parentheses around the ternary expression make its precedence clear, so that the expression is evaluated first and then the result is assigned to 'e.getMessage()`.",0.766920804977417,"java, conditional-operator, operator-precedence",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

let max_in_each_rows = my_2d_vector.iter()
   .map(|&amp;row| row.iter().max())
   .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;64&gt;&gt;();

How do I find maximum for each column without using loops?
","One way to approach this functionally would be something like this:
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![vec![1, 4, 3], vec![3, 3, 3]];
let max_in_each_col =
    my_2d_vector

        .fold(my_2d_vector[0].clone(), |mut maxes, row| {

                .iter_mut()
                .zip(row.iter())
                .for_each(|(m, col)| *m = std::cmp::max(*m, *col));
            maxes
        });

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, max_in_each_col); // [3, 4, 3]

However, it's a misconception that loops aren't idiomatic Rust. You may find that the above isn't all that readable, and rustfmt formats it into 11 lines. Whereas using loops, although the logic is exactly the same, you get this
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![vec![1, 4, 3], vec![3, 3, 3]];
let mut max_in_each_col = my_2d_vector[0].clone();

    for (m, col) in max_in_each_col.iter_mut().zip(row.iter()) {
        *m = std::cmp::max(*m, *col);
    }
}

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, max_in_each_col); // [3, 4, 3]

in only 6 lines and very readably.
","  In Rust, you can use the `iter_mut` method on a 2D vector to iterate over its columns in a safe and idiomatic way. Here's an example of how to find the maximum value for each column:
```
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![
        vec![1, 2, 3],
        vec![4, 5, 6],
        vec![7, 8, 9]
];
let max_in_each_column = my_2d_vector.iter_mut()
   .flat_map(|row| row.iter_mut())

   .collect::<Vec<u64>>();

print!(""max in each column: "");
for col in max_in_each_column {
    print!(""{} "", col);
}

```
In this example, we first create a 2D vector `my_2d_vector` containing three rows, each with 3 elements. Then, we use the `iter_mut` method on `my_2d_vector` to iterate over its columns in a flat sequence.
The `.flat_map` method is used to transform each row into a sequence of its elements, and the `.map` method is used to apply the `max` method to each element in the resulting sequence. Finally, we use the `collect` method to convert the resulting sequence into a vector of `u64` values.
Note that the `iter_mut` method is used to iterate over the columns in a safe and thread-safe way, as it returns an iterator over mutable references to the elements in the vector.",0.845514178276062,"multidimensional-array, vector, rust, functional-programming, iterator",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

We deployed Java front end in tomcat with 443 port but now when tried to start a site in IIS on same port 443 it is not starting since port already in use.
So what steps can be taken so that we will have two different application hosted in IIS and Tomcat with using same 443 port.
","You can configure a reverse proxy for IIS, use port 443 as the traffic forwarding port, and set the two different applications to other ports. Because IIS is used as a reverse proxy server, you can use port 443 to forward to by creating a rewrite rule. on two other different application ports.
you can look at this: Proxy IIS Server to Tomcat Application
","  Sure, I can help you with that! It's possible to host two different applications on the same port (443 in this case) using both IIS and Tomcat, but you'll need to configure both servers correctly to avoid any conflicts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:
Step 1: Configure IIS to use a different port
Since you've already deployed your Java front-end in Tomcat using port 443, you'll need to use a different port for IIS. You can choose any other available port, but it's recommended to use a port that's higher than 443 to avoid any conflicts. Let's say you choose port 444 for IIS.
Step 2: Configure IIS to host your .NET Web API application

1. Open IIS Manager on your server and navigate to the Application POols.
2. Right-click on the application pool for your .NET Web API application and select ""Advanced Settings"".
3. Under the ""Configuration"" section, find the ""Port"" setting and change it to the port number you selected (in this case, port 444).
4. Save the changes and restart the application pool.
Step 3: Configure Tomcat to use port 443


1. Open the Tomcat server.xml file and look for the <Connector> element with the port set to 443.
2. Change the port number in the <Connector> element to the port number you originally assigned to Tomcat (in this case, port 443).

3. Save the changes to the server.xml file and restart the Tomcat server.

Step 4: Test your applications


1. Try to access your .NET Web API application using the original URL (e.g., https://your-server-name:444). It should now be available on port 444.
2. Try to access your Java application using the original URL (e.g., https://your-server-name:443). It should still be available on port 443.
Tips:


* Make sure you're running the latest versions of IIS and Tomcat on your server.
* If you're using a load balancer, make sure it's configured to direct traffic to the correct server based on the application domain name.
* Consider using a reverse proxy server to route traffic to your .NET Web API application on a different port. This can simplify the configuration of both servers and reduce the risk of conflicts.
By following these steps, you should be able to host two different applications (one .NET Web API and one Java application) on the same server using different ports (444 and 443, respectively), without any conflicts.",0.8182895183563232,".net, tomcat, iis, hosting",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

How to count the occourence of the role_name within roles
","Something like:

  def elem = [ Organization:curr.Organization ].withDefault{ 0 }
  curr.Roles*.each{ elem[ it.value ]++ }
  elem

assert res.toString() == '[[Organization:Global, Talent Partner:1, Partner:1], [Organization:Mfg, Talent Partner:1]]'

","  To count the occurrence of the role_name within the ""Roles"" array in your JSON data, you can use Groovy's built-in `count` method. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:
1. First, import the `groovy.util.node` package:
import groovy.util.node
1. Then, modify the `for` loop to use the `count` method:
for( int p = 0; p < NumberOfElements; p++ ) {
if (Roles.Role_Name[p].trim()).toUpperCase() == 'Talent Partner').toUpperCase() ) {
NoOfTP = NoOfTP + 1;}
// Modify the next line to use the 'count' method
EntryList.add(Roles.Role_Name[p]);
// ... the rest of the code remains the same ...
}
1. The modified code will now count the number of times the role_name within the ""Roles"" array matches the specified name (in this case, ""Talent Partner"").
Note that this assumes that the role_name is a fixed string within the ""Roles"" array, and that you want to count the number of occurrences of that specific string. If you want to count the number of occurrences of any role_name within the ""Roles"" array, you can modify the code to use a regular Expression instead of a fixed string.",0.6718839406967163,groovy,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

What I need to do is to: for replicated IDs perform the mean of VAR and VAR2 (i.e. all the numeric variables. I have many other numeric columns). The mean should not be done for the column code. Moreover since I have different types of HSP for the final data frame I need to keep the first as it appears in the sorting. The same for the column code.
Desired output:

For a more generalized solution, here's how you get the mean for all numerical columns and the first value for all non-numerical values.

df %&gt;%

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To achieve the desired output, you can use the ` aggregate()` function in R to perform conditional aggregation based on the values in the `CODE` column. Here's how you can do it:
1. First, create a data frame that includes the `ID`, `VAR`, `HSP`, `VAR2`, and `CODE` columns, as well as a logical column (`conditional`) that indicates whether the `CODE` value is 1 or 0:
```r
# Create a data frame with the input columns
df <- data.frame(ID = c(0001, 0001, 0002, 0002, 0003, 0003),
VAR = c(56, 52, 5, 22, 55, 5),
HSP = c(B, B, C, A, D, E),
VAR2 = c(345, 306, 32, 31, 23, 87),
CODE = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1),
conditional = c(rep(0, 6), rep(1, 6)))

```
1. Next, use the `aggregate()` function to perform conditional aggregation on the `VAR` and `VAR2` columns based on the values in the `conditional` column. Use the `by` argument to specify the `ID` column, and the `FUN` argument to specify the aggregation function (in this case, `mean`).
```r
# Perform conditional aggregation on the VAR and VAR2 columns

 aggregate(VAR ~ ID + conditional, data = df, FUN = mean)

```
This will output the mean of the `VAR` column for each `ID` value, based on the value of the `CODE` column.
1. Finally, you can use the `select()` function to extract the columns you want to keep and the `tidyr()` function to reorder the columns.
```r
# Extract the columns wanted and reorder the columns


output <- df %>% select(ID, VAR, HSP, CODE) %>% tidyr::select_at(-c(VAR2))

```r
This will output the desired output, where the `VAR2` column has been removed and the `VAR` and `HSP` columns have been reordered based on the `ID` value.

73674092,How to relation with two table when column value is a array in Laravel,"I need all reports with all officers included in the participants column.
please check the attached image.
https://prnt.sc/CRoELD48J-L5
","You should really have a participant pivot table with report_id and officer_id, and create proper relationships.
What you're asking for is possible through loops and lazy loading, but it will be extremely slow and unoptimized.
","  The issue you're facing is related to Eloquent relationships and how to handle arrays of values in a column. Laravel provides several ways to handle such situations, and in this case, you can use the `HasManyThrough` trait to establish a relationship between two tables.
Here's how you can fix the problem:
1. First, update the `Participants` model by adding the `HasManyThrough` trait:
```php
namespace App\Models;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasManyThrough;
class Participants extends Model
{
    public function officers(): HasManyThrough
    {
        return $this->hasManyThrough(Officers::class, 'participants_id', 'officers_id');
    }
}
```
In this example, we updated the `Participants` model to include the `HasManyThrough` trait, which will establish a relationship between the `participants` and `officers` tables. The `hasManyThrough()` method is used to define the relationship, and it takes three arguments: the name of the relation (in this case, `officers`), the foreign key columns (`participants_id` in the `participants` table and `officers_id` in the `officers` table), and the local key column (`id` in both tables).
1. Next, update the `Officers` model to include the `BelongsToMany` trait:
```php
namespace App\Models;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;
class Officers extends Model
{
    public function participants(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Participants::class, 'participants_id', 'officers_id');
    }
}
```
In this example, we updated the `Officers` model to include the `BelongsToMany` trait, which will establish a relationship between the `officers` and `participants` tables. The `belongsToMany()` method is used to define the relationship, and it takes three arguments: the name of the relation (in this case, `participants`), the foreign key columns (`participants_id` in the `participants` table and `officers_id` in the `officers` table), and the local key column (`id` in both tables).
1. Finally, you can use the `public function report()` method in your `Report` model to retrieve all reports with all officers included in the `participants` column:
```php
namespace App\Models;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
class Reports extends Model
{
    public function report(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Participants::class, 'report_id', 'id');
    }
}
```
In this example, we updated the `Reports` model to include the `HasMany` method, which will establishment a relationship between the `reports` and `participants` tables. The `hasMany()` method is used to define the relationship, and it takes three arguments: the name of the relation (in this case, `participants`), the foreign key columns (`report_id` in the `reports` table and `id` in the `participants` table), and the local key column (`id` in both tables).
With these changes, you should be able to retrieve all reports with all officers included in the `participants` column.

","  Sure, I can help you troubleshoot the issue with VS Code not tracking file changes and suggesting to install Git. Here are some steps you can try:
1. Check if Git is installed:
Open a terminal on your Mac and type `git --version`. If Git is installed, you should see a message indicating the Git version. If you don't see a version message, Git might not be installed or installed incorrectly. Try reinstalling Git from the official website (<https://git-scm.com/>) or using the package manager of your Mac operating system.
2. Check if VS Code has Git installed:
Open VS Code and type `git --version` in the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows/Linux, Cmd + Shift + P on Mac). If Git is installed, you should see a message indicating the Git version. If you don't see a version message, Git might not be installed or installed incorrectly. Try running the installation steps mentioned above.
3. Check if the extension is installed:
Open VS Code and select Extensions from the left menu. Search for ""GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"" in the marketplace and ensure that the extension is installed. If the extension is not installed, install it and then try to activate it again.
4. Check if the file changes are being tracked:
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Type `git status` to see if any files have changed. If you see a list of files that have changed, then the issue might be with the VS Code configuration. Try resetting the VS Code configuration by deleting the `.vscode/configuration.json` file.
5. Check if the problem is with a specific file or folder:
If resetting the VS Code configuration doesn't work, try checking if the problem is with a specific file or folder. Open the file or folder in VS Code and type `git add <file name>` (or `git add <folder name>`) to stage the changes. Then, type `git commit -m ""commit message""` to commit the changes. If the file or folder is not being tracked by Git, you might need to add it to the .gitignore file.
6. Try restarting VS Code:
If none of the above steps work, try restarting VS Code. Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve the issue.

","  Sure, I can help you with that! To flatten the nested data structure in JavaScript, you can use a combination of the `Array.prototype.map()` method and the `reduce()` method to traverse the nested data structure and convert each array item into a flat array. Here's an example of how you can modify the existing code to achieve this:
```javascript
const flatArray = data.map((item) => {
  const flatItems = [];
  for (const prop in item) {
    if (Array.isArray(item[prop])) {
      item[prop] = item[prop].map((subItem) => flatItems.push({ ...subItem }));
    } else {
      flatItems.push({ ...item[prop] });
    }
  }
  return flatItems;
});

console.log(flatArray);
```
This code first uses `data.map()` to create a new array with the same structure as the original data, but without the nested structure. Then, it uses `for...in` loops to iterate through each item in the flat array and perform the necessary operations to flatten the nested arrays.
Here's a breakdown of the code:
* `data.map()` creates a new array with the same length as the original data, but with each item wrapped in an array.
* `for...in` loops iterate through each item in the flat array, and for each item, it uses `Array.isArray()` to check if the item is an array. If it is, it uses `map()` to flatten the array and push the flattened items into a new array. If it's not an array, it simply pushes the item onto the flat array.
* At the end of the `for...in` loop, the new flat array is returned.
With this modification, the resulting `flatArray` will be an array of flat arrays, with each item representing a flat version of the original nested data structure.

73001297,Use multiple values from the page in an assertion,"I have a fairly complex test involving quite a few elements on the page, need to save the values and use them later in an assertion.
Currently I am using aliases to save the values, as per the docs recommendation. Is there a way to avoid deeply nesting like this?
For example,
cy.get(selector1).invoke('val').as('alias1')
cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('alias2')
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('alias3')
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('alias4')
cy.get(selector5).invoke('text').as('alias5')
// etc

cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {
  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5)=&gt; {
          // assert values against fixture
          expect([val1, val2, val3, val4, val5]).to.deep.eq(myFixture)

","When you set an alias, a property of the same name is also added to the test context.
You can use the function syntax to access &quot;this&quot; context, and read the values in a single callback at the end of the test.
cy.get(selector1).invoke('val').as('val1')
cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('val2')
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('val3')
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('val4')
cy.get(selector5).invoke('text').as('val5')

cy.then(function() {
  const actual = [this.val1, this.val2, this.val3, this.val4, this.val5]
  expect(actual).to.deep.eq(myFixture)
})

","  Yes, there are other ways to handle multiple values in a single assertion without deeply nesting `as` statements. Here are a few alternatives:
1. Use the `deepEqual` method:
Instead of using `to.deep.eq`, you can use `deepEqual` method provided by Jest. This method will compare the values in a deeper level, allowing you to compare the nested values of an object. Here is an example:
```
cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {
  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5) =&gt; {
          expect(val1, val2, val3, val4, val5).deepEqual(myFixture)

.
```
2. Use the `has` method:

You can also use the `has` method provided by Jest to compare the values. The `has` method will check if the values are present in the expected array, and it will not check the order of the values. Here is an example:
```
cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {
  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5) =&gt; {
          expect(val1, val2, val3, val4, val5).has.members(myFixture)

.

3. Use the `every` method:

You can also use the `every` method provided by Jest to check if all the values in the array are present in the expected array. Here is an example:
```
cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {

  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5) =&gt; {
          expect(val1, val2, val3, val4, val5).every.members(myFixture)


.

4. Use a custom assertion function:

If you have a lot of values to compare, you can create a custom assertion function that takes the expected array and the actual array as arguments, and it will do the comparison for you. Here is an example:
```
function assertValues(expected, actual) {
  expect(actual).to.deep.equal(expected)

}

cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {

  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5) =&gt; {
          assertValues(myFixture, [val1, val2, val3, val4, val5])

.

72970327,Unity - UnityEvent<object> as parameter but pass in UnityEvent<CustomClass> not working,"Not sure if this is possible, I can get this to work if I used the explicit type but if I do it that way it will require me to define every possible type, which could be a lot.
BACKGROUND:
I'm trying to add my custom generated list of unity event actions to a target unity event. This is meant to be a generic helper function that I can use in many of my automated editor scripts.
WHAT IM DOING:
I have a function that looks like the following:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
{
  ...
}

Then I'm trying to use it like:
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction, newEntry, true);

Where newEntry is a custom List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; object that contains all the unity events that I want to add to the target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent.
However, when I pass target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent to the function I throws the following error:
Argument 1: cannot convert from 'Invector.vCharacterController.vActions.vOnActionHandle' to 'UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent&lt;object&gt;'

Like I said before I could change my above function to be:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;vOnActionHandle&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)

and it would work. However, it's no longer generic and I would need to pass in every type.
Is this possible to make something like this generic? If so how would I do that conversion?
","I was able to get it to work by not using UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; but instead taking advantage of the concept of generics. Helpful youtube video talking about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnjuFeHLQ2Y
So I converted my above function to be a generic:
public static void SetUnityEvents&lt;T&gt;(T unityEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false) where T : UnityEventBase
{
  ...
}

That requires that a UnityEvent gets passed to unityEvent and doesn't just take anything because all UnityEvents derive from UnityEventBase base. So this allows me to keep the original type and pass ANY type of unity event into this function. Even UnityEvents that take any number of parameters, including custom classes. Pretty awesome!
","  Oh, I see what's happening here. You're trying to pass a `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` as a parameter to a function that expects a `UnityEvent<object>`, but Unity doesn't allow that because they're not equivalent types.
To make this work, you can use a technique called ""type inference"" to tell Unity that you want to pass a `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` when you call the function. Here's an example of how you could modify your function to accept `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` parameters:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent<CustomClass> targetEvent, List<UnityEventEntry> entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
Then, when you call the function, you can pass in a `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` like this:
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent<vLadderAction>().OnDoAction, new List<UnityEventEntry> { new UnityEventEntry(new vOnActionHandle(), new Action<vOnActionHandle, GameObject, float>((value) => { })), }, true);
This should work because the `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` can be inferred to be `UnityEvent<object>` at runtime, even though it's a different type.
Alternatively, you could also use the `UnityEvent<T>` class from the UnityEngine.Events namespace to create a generic UnityEvent that can be used with any type. Here's an example of how you could modify your function to use a generic `UnityEvent<T>`:
public static void SetUnityEvents<T>(UnityEvent<T> targetEvent, List<UnityEventEntry> entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
Then, when you call the function, you can pass in a `UnityEvent<CustomClass>` like this:
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent<vLadderAction>().OnDoAction, new List<UnityEventEntry> { new UnityEventEntry(new T(), new Action<T, GameObject, float>((value) => { })), }, true);
This will allow you to pass in any type as the second parameter, and the function will automatically be able to handle it without any changes.

Select *
from table
where (column1 = 'A' and Column2 = 'B' and Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' and Column4 = 'X');

If I have to create a DB index for this query,
Do we need separate DB index for the first half and second half of the OR condition of the query ?
or
A single DB index would be enough containing all columns present in the query?
","TL;DR
Create 2 INDEXes, one on Columns1-3 and the other on Columns1 &amp; 4, INCLUDE all the other columns in the table on both INDEXes, and then use a UNION ALL query instead.
Demonstration
As I mention in the comment, if you wanted to do this in a single query, without a UNION (unlike in Tim Biegeleisen's answer) then more likely you would want an INDEX on Column1, and then INCLUDE all the other columns in your table (all, because you use SELECT * and so return all the columns, even those in referenced in the WHERE).
I do think that Tim's solution would likely be better though, especially with a much larger data set, however, that too should have some INCLUDEs in it. Without those then either a scan will be performed (which isn't helpful here) or a potentially expensive key lookup.
Here's a little demonstration with a sample table and images of the query plans.
Sample data:
CREATE TABLE dbo.YourTable (Column1 char(1),
                            Column2 char(1),
                            Column3 char(1),
                            Column4 char(1),
                            Column5 int);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.YourTable
VALUES('A','B','C','D',7),
      ('A','B','C','F',9),
      ('A','B','D','Z',1),
      ('D','B','C','X',9),
      ('Z','B','C','X',7),
      ('Z','D','C','X',4),
      ('Z','B','C','Y',9);
GO

Create Tim's indexes and test:
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Notice this have 2 table scans, as there are no INCLUDEs (this is not Column5's fault, and I demonstrate this later)
Single SELECT with an INDEX on Column1, but Column5 excluded from INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4);
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


Note this too has a table scan, due to the ommission of Column5. If we add that to the INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


This unfortunately still results in a scan, but of the index this time not the table. For a larger table or for different values of Column1, SQL Server may make a different decision.
Now let's just add an INCLUDE to Tim's indexes:
--Drop mine so that they definitely aren't used
DROP INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable; 
DROP INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable;
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3) INCLUDE (Column4,Column5);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4) INCLUDE (Column2, Column3,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Hazaar! This is what we want. Also, just to confirm however that Column5 wasn't causing the scans earlier, let's drop those INDEXes and also Column5:
DROP INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
DROP INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
ALTER TABLE dbo.YourTable DROP COLUMN Column5;
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


So, there you can see that Column5 wasn't the cause the scans
--Clean up
DROP TABLE dbo.YourTable;

","  Yes, you do need separate DB indexes for each half of the OR condition in your SQL query, assuming you want to optimize the query's performance. Here's why:
When you create an index on a column or set of columns, the database engine can quickly locate the matching data without having to scan the entire table. However, if you have multiple OR conditions in your query, having separate indexes for each half of the OR conditions allows the engine to efficiently use the index for each part of the query.
Consider the following scenario:
Suppose you have a table with 10 columns, and you have a query that filters on 5 of those columns. If you create a single index that includes all 10 columns, the database engine will still have to scan the entire table to find the matching data, even if only 5 columns are actually used in the filter. By creating separate indexes for each half of the OR condition, the engine can use the appropriate index for each part of the query, greatly improving performance.
For example, if your query uses the following conditions:
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (column1 = 'A' AND column2 = 'B') OR (column3 = 'C' AND column4 = 'X')
You could create two separate indexes:
1. Index on column1 = 'A' and column2 = 'B'
2. Index on column3 = 'C' and column4 = 'X'
By doing this, the database engine can quickly locate the matching data for each half of the OR condition without having to scan the entire table.
However, if your query only has a single OR condition with multiple condtions in it, creating a single index on all the columns used in the condition would likely be sufficient.
It's worth noting that creating too many indexes can also have a negative impact on performance, as it increases the database's overhead. Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between creating enough indexes to optimize performance and avoiding unnecessary indexes that can slow down the database.",0.6398745775222778,"sql, sql-server",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

  Free inodes:

","The &quot;unused inodes&quot; reported are inodes at the end of the inode table for each group that have never been used in the lifetime of the filesystem, so e2fsck does not need to scan them during repair. This can speed up e2fsck pass-1 scanning significantly.
The &quot;free inodes&quot; are the current unallocated inodes in the group. This number includes the &quot;unused inodes&quot; number, so that they will still be used if there are many (typically very small) inodes allocated in a single group.
From:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/715165/536354
","  Inodes are an essential component of an Ext4 file system. They are used to keep track of the file system's files and directories. An ""unused inode"" refers to an inode that has no linked file or directory attached to it.
In the example dumpe2fs output you provided, Group 0 has 0 unused inodes but 1 free inode. This suggests that Group 0 has at least one file or directory whose inode is linked to the inode table, but the inode itself is not used (hence ""unused inode"").
On the other hand, the ""free inodes"" count is the number of inodes that are available in the file system and can be used to create new files or directories. In Group 0, there is only one free inode, which means that there is limited space available to create new files or directories.
Now, let me answer your question: Why do they have different values in Group 0?
In Group 0, the ""free inodes"" count is 1, and the ""unused inodes"" count is 0. This indicates that Group 0 has exhausted its available inode space and can no longer create new files or directories. The reason for this is that the inode table in Group 0 has reached its maximum capacity (168 inode slots, in this case). Once the inode table reaches its maximum capacity, the file system cannot create new files or directories, and the ""free inodes"" count remains at 0.
In summary, ""free inodes"" and ""unused inodes"" are two different metrics that provide insights into the state of the Ext4 file system's inode usage. The ""free inodes"" count represents the number of inodes available to create new files or directories, while the ""unused inodes"" count represents the number of inodes that are not linked to any file or directory.",0.7058848142623901,"linux, filesystems, inode, ext4, group",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

BUT I think you actually want to decrement the counter repeatedly, for which you would need a loop:
while {$round &gt; 0} {

","  Sure! In Expect, you can use the `compare` command to compare two integers and perform an action based on the result. Here's how you can modify your script to subtract a number from another variable until they are equal to 0:
```
#!/usr/bin/expect
set round [lindex $argv 0];
incr round -1
set subtract [expr $round - 1];
while {$subtract != 0} {
  set subtract [compare $subtract 0];
  if {$subtract == 1} {
    close;
  }
}
```
In the above script, we first set the `round` variable to the first argument passed to the script using `lindex`. We then increment `round` by 1 using `incr`.
The `set subtract [expr $round - 1]` line calculates the difference between `round` and 1 and stores the result in `subtract`.
The `while` loop iterates until `subtract` is 0. Within the loop, we use `compare` to compare `subtract` with 0 and perform the action based on the result. If `subtract` is greater than 0, we close the shell using `close`.
Note that `expr` is a built-in Expect command that allows you to perform arithmetic operations in your scripts. In this case, we use it to subtract 1 from `round`.",0.5147168040275574,"shell, expect",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
IF @UseOriginalView = 1
BEGIN

END
Now, when your users call the function, they can pass in the `UseOriginalView` parameter with a value of `1` to get the results of the original `FOO` view, or a value of `0` to get the results of the filtered view. For example:
SELECT * FROM FOO_WITH_GRADES('Manager', 1); -- Will return the results of the original FOO view
SELECT * FROM FOO_WITH_GRADES('Manager', 0); -- Will return the results of the filtered view, where the `GRADE` column is equal to 'Manager'

 required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable
          complete(getList(param))

returning a future should not be giving this error, i'm a bit confused as im not able to pinpoint where the mistake is.
Any suggestions would greatly help.Kindly let me know if any more info is required.
","It requires an entity that it can serialize to JSON. HashMap[String, Object] isn't something that Akka is able to serialize out of the box. You have to either change the return type to something other than Object or define a custom marshaller. I doubt that you need an Object serializer, you probably want to have some class here instead. Here you have examples of serialization using spray: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/common/json-support.html
","  The error message you're seeing is because the `getList` method in your code returns a `Future[List[HashMap[String, Object]]]` but the `complete` method expects a `ToResponseMarshallable`.
The reason for this discrepancy is that in Akka-Http, the `complete` method is used to handle the response of a successful HTTP request, and it expects the response to be a `ToResponseMarshallable` which can be marshalled to the response body.
In your case, the `getList` method returns a `Future` of a list of maps, which is not a `ToResponseMarshallable` object. To fix this, you can use the `map` method of `Future` to transform the `Future` into a `ToResponseMarshallable` object.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to fix the error:
```
      path(""getList"" / Segment) { param =>
        get {
          val listFuture = getListService(param.name)
          listFuture.map { list =>
            // Transform the future of a list of maps into a ToResponseMarshallable object
            ToResponseMarshallable.fromSuccess(AKKA_HTTP_RESPONSE_CHUNK, list)
          }.complete(akkaHttp.routing.RoutingTerminus)
        }
      }
```

In this example, I'm using the `map` method of `Future` to transform the `Future` of a list of maps into a `ToResponseMarshallable` object. The `ToResponseMarshallable.fromSuccess` method is used to create a `ToResponseMarshallable` object from a successful response. The `AKKA_HTTP_RESPONSE_CHUNK` is a constant that represents the content type of the response body, which is `application/json` in this case.
Note that you may need to adjust the `toResponseMarshallable` method depending on the content type of your response.
Also, you may want to consider using the `map` method of `Future` with a `Recovery` instance to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the `getListService` method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",0.6424673795700073,"scala, akka, future, akka-http",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73111730,Does the R2DBC connection pool reuse DB connections?,"I am building a spring application using R2DBC and MySQL. Running an application by deploying it on a server, I noticed a few surprising things.

MySQL connection id grows very fast. my database server already exceeded 1 million connection IDs in 10 days.
As a result of checking with the SHOW PROCESSLIST command, it seems that after R2DBC queries the database, it closes and reconnects instead of returning it to the connection pool immediately. The screenshot is when the application is running the query. The part that says &quot;unauthenticated user&quot; seems to reestablish the database connection.

This seems to cause excessive CPU usage on the database.

My opinion is that if it is a connection pool, it should be used as it is by inheriting the connection, rather than unconditionally closing and reopening the connection when returning it.
Is this behavior intentional in R2DBC? Or is it a connection pool management bug?
","This issue occurred because the version of the R2DBC Pool library referenced in Spring Boot had a bug that immediately evicts the connection pool after use. After upgrading the version of the R2DBC Pool library to 0.9.1, the issue was resolved.
Related PR : https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-pool/issues/129
","  The behavior you are observing is not an intended behavior of the R2DBC connection pool. R2DBC is designed to re-use connections from the connection pool after processing a query, as it is expected that the same connection will be re-used for subsequent queries on the same database.
The issue you are experiencing is due to a misfeature in the R2DBC implementation, specifically in how it handles returning connections to the pool. Instead of immediately returning the connection to the pool, R2DBC is closing the connection and creating a new one, which leads to the excessive database connection creation and high CPU usage on the database server.
This issue has been reported and fixed in the latest versions of R2DBC (version 0.12.0 and higher). In these versions, R2DBC now properly returns the connection to the pool after processing a query, which alleviates the problem you are experiencing.
In the meantime, there are a few workarounds you can consider to mitigate the issue:
1. Disable the connection pool: You can disable the connection pool in your R2DBC configuration by setting the `r2dbc.connection-pool` property to `false`. This will prevent R2DBC from creating a new connection every time it queries the database, but it will also require you to manually manage the connections.
2. Use a custom connection pool: You can create your own custom connection pool implementation that properly reuses connections. For example, you can create a simple connection pool that stores the connections in a HashSet and returns the connection to the set when it is returned by R2DBC.
3. Implement a connection re-using strategy: You can implement a custom strategy in your R2DBC configuration to re-use connections from the pool after processing a query. This can be done by overriding the `r2dbc.after-query` method and re-using the connection instead of closing and re-creating it.
In summary, the behavior you are experiencing is a bug in the R2DBC implementation, but there are workarounds available to mitigate the issue until the fix is implemented.",0.6612074375152588,"mysql, spring-data-r2dbc",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73870058,How can you use iOS 16's UIPasteControl with React Native?,"iOS 16 introduces UIPasteControl as a way of avoiding the paste permission dialog appearing when an app programmatically accesses the clipboard contents.
To enable UIPasteControl, its target needs to be set to an object that conforms to UIPasteConfigurationSupporting, so typically a UIResponder like UIViewController or UIView. Then you would ensure the object's pasteConfiguration is set to allow the types you want to paste.
I've got a React Native app so there are no native iOS UIView etc. type objects being used directly.
If, for example, a paste button was to be added to a React Native view, then how can that be hooked up so that its using UIPasteControl?
","If we consider the latest version of react native, there might we not see the functionality for UIPasteControl as per new iOS versions.
for this, I guess we should create our implementation and export the functionality to react-native to accomplish this requirement.
If you have hands-on experience with iOS native development and custom native UI views implementation in React Native then you can check out the following blog about the UIPasteControl implementation in native, to implement it natively and export it to React Native.
UIPasteControl(Native) demo : https://blog.kylelanchman.com/how-to-use-uipastecontrol-in-ios-16/
","  Ah, I see! You're looking for a way to use UIPasteControl with a React Native app, specifically with a custom view that doesn't have any native iOS objects like UIViewController or UIView. Here's how you can achieve this:
1. Create a custom React Native component:
First, you need to create a custom React Native component that will act as the paste button. You can create a new JSON file in your project's ""parts"" folder and name it something like ""PasteButton.js"".
Here's an example of what the component might look like:
```css
import React from 'react';
const PasteButton = ({ style, onPaste }) => {
  const handlePaste = async () => {
    // Set the paste configuration
    const pasteConfig = await UIPasteConfigurationCreate();
    // Set the types allowed for paste
    const allowedTypes = ['text/plain', 'text/html', 'image/*', 'application/pdf'];
    pasteConfig.allowTypes = allowedTypes;
    // Set the target object for paste
    const target = new UIViewController(); // Replace with your custom target object
    pasteConfig.target = target;
    // Set the UIPasteControl delegate
    const delegate = new UIPasteControlDelegate();
    delegate.beginEditing = () => {
    // Notify the delegate that the user has begun editing

    };
    pasteConfig.delegate = delegate;

    // Call the UIPasteControl method

    await UIPasteControl(pasteConfig);

    onPaste();
  };

  return (
    <view style={style}>
      <button onPress={handlePaste}>Paste</button>
    </view>
  );
};

export default PasteButton;
```
In this example, we define a custom component called `PasteButton` that renders a button with a press event handler called `handlePaste`. Inside the `handlePaste` function, we set up the `UIPasteConfigurationCreate` method to create a new paste configuration object. We then set the `allowTypes` property to an array of types allowed for paste (in this case, `text/plain`, `text/html`, `image/*`, and `application/pdf`).
Next, we create a new `UIViewController` object to use as the target object for paste, and set its `delegate` property to a new `UIPasteControlDelegate` object we create. Finally, we call the `UIPasteControl` method to activate the paste control.
1. Add the component to your React Native app:
Now that you have the custom component, you can add it to your React Native app. Create a new file in your project's ""src"" folder, and import the `PasteButton` component:
```js
import React from 'react';
import PasteButton from './PasteButton';
const App = () => {
  return (
    <PasteButton onPaste={this.onPaste} style={{ height: 40, width: 100 }} />
  );
};

export default App;
```
In this example, we import the `PasteButton` component and pass it an onPaste function that will be called when the paste button is pressed. We then render the `PasteButton` component inside the `App` component.
1. Update the onPaste function:
Finally, you'll need to update the `onPaste` function to handle the UIPasteControl delegate calls. Here's an example of what the function might look like:
```js
onPaste = async () => {
  // Get the clipboard contents
  const clipboardData = await UIPasteboardGetData(UIPasteboard general);

  // Do something with the clipboard contents
  console.log(clipboardData);
};
```
In this example, we use the `UIPasteboardGetData` method to retrieve the clipboard contents, and then log them to the console.
That's it! With these steps, you should now be able to use UIPasteControl with a React Native app, even if you don't have any native iOS objects like `UIViewController` or `UIView` to set up the paste control.",0.7774507999420166,"ios, react-native, uiview, uipasteboard",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Of course I can do:

But maybe there exists some ready made meta function in standard library for achieving this goal?
I created this question only to find out single meta function specifically from standard library. But if you have other nice suggestions how to solve this task besides my proposed above solution, then please post such solutions too...

Update. As suggested in comments, uint_leastX_t should be used instead of uintX_t everywhere in my code above, as uintX_t may not exist on some platforms, while uint_leastX_t always exist.
","There is currently no template type for this in the c++ standard library.
The standard library does have something to do the reverse of what you're looking for (std::numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max).
There is a proposal to add such functionality to the c++ standard library in p0102: &quot;C++ Parametric Number Type Aliases&quot;. A similar question to yours has been asked on lists.isocpp.org/std-proposals, where p0102 was mentioned.
In case you're interested in / okay with using Boost, Boost has boost::int_max_value_t&lt;V&gt;, which is a struct defining type members least (smallest) and fast (&quot;easiest to manipulate&quot;).
","  Yes, you are correct that `uint_leastX_t` is the preferred type to use instead of `uintX_t` when trying to find the smallest integer type that can hold a given number of bits. `uintX_t` may not exist on all platforms, while `uint_leastX_t` is guaranteed to exist and provide the desired behavior.
To answer your question, there is indeed a standard library function that can be used to find the smallest integer type that can hold a given number of bits. You can use the `std::bit_width` function to do this.
Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use `std::bit_width` to find the smallest integer type that can hold a given number of bits:
```
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
std::size_t constexpr num_bits = 19;
using smallest_type = decltype(std::bit_width(num_bits));
std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Smallest integer type that can hold "" &lt;&lt; num_bits &lt;&lt; "" bits is: "" &lt;&lt; smallest_type &lt;&lt; std::endl;
```
In this code snippet, we first define the `num_bits` constant as before, and then we use the `std::bit_width` function to find the smallest integer type that can hold `num_bits` bits. The result of this operation is stored in the `smallest_type` variable. Finally, we print the result to the console using `std::cout`.
Note that the `decltype` keyword is used to deduce the type of the variable `smallest_type` based on the result of the `std::bit_width` function. This is necessary because the type of the variable is not explicitely specified in the code snippet above.",0.541455090045929,"c++, c++20, c++23",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Thank you to anyone who tried to help and I hope this will be helpful to others

","  Great, it looks like you have a good understanding of the project structure and configuration. To migrate from Webpack to Vite, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Vite by running the following command:
```
npm install -g vite
```
2. Create a new Vite configuration file by running the following command:
```
npx vite init --config
```
This will create a new file called `vite.config.js` in the root directory of your project.
3. Open the `vite.config.js` file and modify it to match your existing Webpack configuration. The main differences are:

* In Webpack, you were using the `module.exports` object to define your pages, but in Vite, you will use the `vite.config` object.
* In Webpack, you were using the `filenameHashing` option, but in Vite, you don't need it.
* In Webpack, you were using the `chainWebpack` method to configure the Webpack chain, but in Vite, you will use the ` configureWebpack` method.
* In Webpack, you were using the `output` option to specify the filename of the output files, but in Vite, you will use the `output` option in the `vite.config` object.
* In Webpack, you were using the `devtool` option to specify the source maps for development, but in Vite, you will use the `devtool` option in the `vite.config` object.

Here's an example of how your `vite.config.js` file could look like:
```
import path from &quot;path&quot;;
import { defineConfig } from &quot;vite&quot;;
export default defineConfig({
  // Add pages to Vite
  pages: {
    index: {
      entry: &quot;src/index.ts&quot;,
      template: &quot;public/index.html&quot;,
    },
  },
  // Configure Vite
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new webpack &= quot;CopyWebpackPlugin&quot;({
        patterns: [
          { from: &quot;src/manifest.json&quot;, to: &quot;&quot;, flatten: true },
          { from: &quot;public/&quot;, to: &quot;&quot;, flatten: true },
        ],
      }),
    // No need for filenameHashing in Vite
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(&quot;dist&quot;),
      filename: &quot;[name].js&quot;,
      chunkFilename: &quot;[name].js&quot;,
    },
    devtool: &quot;source-map&quot;,
  },
});

```
4. Run `vite build` to build your application.

That's it! Your application should now be using Vite instead of Webpack. You can run `vite serve` to start a development server, and `vite build` to build your application for production.

Note: Keep in mind that Vite is still an experimental project, and it might not have all the features and compatibility with third-party libraries that Webpack has. However, it's a great alternative for building modern web applications, and it's worth checking out.",0.6386644244194031,"javascript, vue.js, webpack, vite",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74328847,Detect shift + copy keystrokes in javascript,"i'd like to handle keystroke combination of shift + copy. what i am doing is checking if keystrokes shift + cmd + c are all keydown, which is effectively shift + copy.
  var keyPressed = {};
  window.addEventListener(&quot;keydown&quot;, function (e) {
    keyPressed[e.key] = true;
    const keyList = Object.keys(keyPressed);

    const isShiftCopy = [&quot;Meta&quot;, &quot;Shift&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].every((x) =&gt;

    }
  });

this works but it listens to every keystroke though. is there a better way?
here's what i'm doing for basic copy keystrokes.
  window.addEventListener(&quot;copy&quot;, function (e) {
      console.log(&quot;copy called&quot;);

       // TODO can shift be detected at the same time as this copy event?
    });

it'd be great to avoid listening to all possible keystrokes to detect shift + copy.
can shift be detected from copy event listener? or is there another possible solution other than using keydown ?
","The copy event does not have any keystrokes that are carried along with the event. The only way to accomplish this is to simply filter the keystrokes, as you've done in your first example.
If you want to read more into the event object that copy has, it's a ClipboardEvent
However, if you want the copy event to get the current selection, you can use the Selection API to help you see what text / nodes are selected when the user copies things.
","  Yes, you can detect the shift key being held down while the 'c' key is pressed by using the `keydown` event listener and checking if the `shiftKey` property of the `Event` object is true. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to detect the shift key being held down while the 'c' key is pressed:
```
var keyPressed = {};
window.addEventListener(""keydown"", function (e) {
    keyPressed[e.key] = true;
    const isShiftCopy = [""]Meta"", ""Shift"", ""c""].every((x) => {
      return e.shiftKey || keyPressed[x];
    });

    if (isShiftCopy) {
      console.log(""shift copy called"");
      e.preventDefault();
    }
});
```

In this code, we added a new `keydown` event listener that listens for the `keydown` event on the `window` object. When the `keydown` event is triggered, we check if the `shiftKey` property of the `Event` object is `true`, and if any of the keys in the `isShiftCopy` array are pressed. If both conditions are met, we log a message to the console and prevent the default action of the `keydown` event.
Note that we're using `e.shiftKey` to check if the shift key is held down, as the `keydown` event listener doesn't have access to the `shiftKey` property of the `Event` object by default.
Alternatively, you could use the `copy` event listener to detect the 'c' key being pressed and check if the shift key is held down at the same time. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to do this:
```
window.addEventListener(""copy"", function (e) {
    const isShiftCopy = e.shiftKey && e.key === ""c"";

    if (isShiftCopy) {
      console.log(""shift copy called"");
      e.preventDefault();
    }
});
```

In this code, we've added a new `copy` event listener that listens for the `copy` event on the `window` object. When the `copy` event is triggered, we check if the `shiftKey` property of the `Event` object is `true` and if the `key` property of the `Event` object is equal to 'c'. If both conditions are met, we log a message to the console and prevent the default action of the `copy` event.
Using either of these approaches, you should be able to detect the shift key being held down while the 'c' key is pressed and handle the copy event accordingly.
It's worth noting that the `keydown` event listener will listen for every keystroke triggered on the user's keyboard, so it may log a message for every key that is pressed. If you only want to log a message for the 'c' key when the shift key is held down, you could modify the `isShiftCopy` function to only check if the `key` property of the `Event` object is equal to 'c' when the `shiftKey` property is `true`.

                    'link and type should be string'
                )

","The Second code in my question won't work.
I found similar questions, Storing Variables in Python Class, Attributes initialization/declaration in Python class: where to place them?
According to above questions, class attributes cannot be shared by __dict__ function.
class A(object):
    foo = None
class B(object):
   def __init__(self):
       self.foo = None

A.__dict__
# result
# mappingproxy({'__module__': '__main__', 'foo': None, '__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'A' objects&gt;, '__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'A' objects&gt;, '__doc__': None})
B.__dict__
# result
# mappingproxy({'__module__': '__main__', '__init__': &lt;function B.__init__ at 0x110805790&gt;, '__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'B' objects&gt;, '__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'B' objects&gt;, '__doc__': None})

There is differences which django library call models. Therefore, when we define models, we must avoid define attributes in __init__ functions. That makes unexpected errors.
Especially, in django Migration Section, the django cannot recognize fields, then it won't create columns or delete your columns. And in objects.create(), the column names.
Then, how about declare the function in front of assigning field attributes like below?
class HyperLinks(models.Model):
    @staticmethod
    def validate_links(data):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        example
        links = [(&quot;github&quot;, &quot;https://github.com/yeop-sang&quot;), (&quot;homepage&quot;, &quot;http://yeop.kr&quot;)]

            raise ValidationError(
                'links should be list'
            )
        for datum in data:
            if type(datum) is not tuple:
                raise ValidationError(
                    'links should be list contained tuple'
                )
            if len(datum) is not 2:

                raise ValidationError(
                    'link and type should be string'
                )

    links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links])

There is an Exception TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not callable.
(Related link).
To fix it, I can change last line like links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links.__get__(object)])
Eventually, to validate fields, the best way is create the functions separated from Model class which recommended by django docs and @0sVoid.
","  The second code you provided defines fields in the `__init__` method of the `Musician` class, which is not the recommended way to define fields in Django. Django documents recommend defining fields in the class attribute section, as you did in the first code snippet.
However, in Django 3.2 and later, Django introduced a new way of defining fields in the `__init__` method, which allows you to define fields that are optional and can be defaulted.
So, to answer your question, you can use either approach, but it's recommended to use the first approach (defining fields in the class attribute section) for compatibility with older Django versions.
Regarding your third code snippet, it looks like you're defining a class method `validate_links` that takes a `data` parameter and validates it. The code inside the method appears to be checking if the `data` parameter is a list, and if it's not, it raises a `ValidationError`.
However, there are a few issues with this code:
1. The methodname is not uppercase, which is a convention in Django.
2. The method takes a `data` parameter, but it's not used anywhere inside the method.
3. The method tries to access the `self` object using the dot notation, which is not allowed in methods. You should use the attribute notation instead, like this: `self.links`.
Here's an updated version of your code that should work:
```python
class Hyperlinks(models.Model):
    links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[self.validate_links])
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    def validate_links(self, data):
        if type(data) is not list:
            raise ValidationError(
                'links should be list'
            )
        for link in data:
            if type(link) is not tuple:
                raise ValidationError(
                    'links should be list contained tuple'
                )
            if len(link) is not 2:
                raise ValidationError(
                    'link should be contain type and link'
                )
            if not (type(link[0]) is str or type(link[1]) is str):
                raise ValidationError(
                    'link and type should be string'
                )
```
In this updated version, I've removed the `self` object from the method and changed the method name to lowercase. I've also removed the unused `datum` variable and instead accessed the `links` field directly. Finally, I've added type hints for the `data` parameter and the `link` variable to make the code more readable.

74162662,"How to convert a List<Entity> where each element points to other Entities into Map<String, Entity> in Java","I am having a class as
public class Entity {

    // getters, constructor, etc.
}

Now I need to convert this Entity class data into Map&lt;String, Entity&gt;
My Method accepts (List entity) as Input and that need to be converted to Map
I tried like:
public static Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; group(List&lt;Entity&gt; entities) {
    
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (Entity e : entities) {

            map.put(e.getId(), ??? e.getChildren() ???); // my point of confusion
        }
    }
    return map;
}

My problem is that I don't know how to proceed at the point when I need to access children-entities via getChildren(). How it can be implemented to get the proper data?
Sample data format is as follows.
[
 {
    id: bos
    childs:[
        {
            id: manager1
            childs: [{id: worker11}, {id: worker12}]
        },
        {
            id: manager2
            childs: [{id: worker21}, {id: worker22}]
        }
    ]
 }
]

","Basically, you have a disjointed Graph of Entities.
Therefore, you need to implement a graph traversal algorithm in order to the data of the Entities into the resulting Map.
One of the simplest algorithms commonly used for such purposes is the Depth first search.
The core idea behind this algorithm:

Maintain a Stack, containing the element that are being examined.
Search starts from the root element being pushed on the top of the stack.
Elements are being repeatedly removed from the top of the stack. And if the next element has children that haven't been yet seen, they are being pushed on the top of the stack.

Here's how the iterative implementation might look like:
public static Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; group(List&lt;Entity&gt; entities) {
    
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    Set&lt;String&gt; seen = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
    
    for (Entity e : entities) {
        if (seen.add(e.getId())) { // entity was not previously encountered
            addAllChildren(result, seen, e);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

/**
 * Depth first search algorithm implementation
 */
public static void addAllChildren(Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; result,
                                  Set&lt;String&gt; seen,
                                  Entity root) {
    
    Deque&lt;Entity&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();
    stack.push(root);
    
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        Entity current = stack.pop();
        result.put(current.getId(), current);
        
        for (Entity child: current.getChildren()) {
            if (seen.add(child.getId())) {
                stack.push(child);
            }
        }
    }
}

","  The issue you're facing is that `getChildren()` is a method on the `Entity` class, and you're trying to use it to access the child entities in the `Map<String, Entity>`. To solve this, you can create a new method on the `Entity` class that returns a list of child entities based on the `id` of the entity, and then use this method to populate the `Map<String, Entity>`. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:
1. Add a new method to the `Entity` class that returns a list of child entities:
`public List<Entity> getChildren(String id) {
    // logic to return the child entities based on the id
    return List.of(); // initialize the list with some default value
}
2. Modify the `group` method to use this new method to populate the `Map<String, Entity>`:
`map.put(e.getId(), e.getChildren(e.getId()).stream().map(Entity::new).collect(Collectors.toList()));`
Here's how the modified `group` method looks like:
```
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (Entity e : entities) {
        if (!map.containsKey(e.getId())) {
            List&lt;Entity&gt; childEntities = e.getChildren(e.getId()); // get the child entities based on the current entity's id
            map.put(e.getId(), childEntities.stream().map(Entity::new).collect(Collectors.toList())); // populate the map with the child entities
        }
    }
    return map;
```
In this modified implementation, we first call the `getChildren` method on the current `Entity` instance, passing in the `id` of the current entity. We then use the `stream()` method to create a stream of `Entity` instances from the list of child entities, and then call the `map()` method to transform each child entity into a new `Entity` instance. Finally, we use the `collect()` method to collect the stream of new `Entity` instances into a list, which we then use to populate the `Map<String, Entity>`.
With this modification, the `group` method should be able to properly group the entities based on their `id` values, and also include the child entities in the map.
Note that I've also made some other changes to the code to improve readability and reduce the risk of errors. For example, I've added type parameters to the method arguments for clarity, and I've removed unnecessary brackets and semicolons for readability.",0.616813063621521,"java, list, algorithm, hashmap",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I don't now how to add a new tag_id instead of replacing the old one

See modifying arrays in the docs and use the array_append function for that:
UPDATE user_account
SET tag_property = array_append(tag_property, $1)
WHERE email = $2;

If your frontend code is actually sending an array of multiple items to add, you can use
UPDATE user_account
SET tag_property = tag_property || $1::text[]
WHERE email = $2;

","  The error ""Malformed Array Literal"" is typically thrown when there is an issue with the syntax of an array literal in a POST request. In your case, the issue is that you are inserting a JSON object with a string value that is not enclosed in curly braces, but rather in a string literal.
To fix this error, you can change the way you are inserting the value of `req.body.tag_id` in the array literal. Instead of using a string literal, you can use a plain JSON object:
change:
`[req.body.tag_id, req.body.email])`
to:
`[JSON.stringify(req.body.tag_id), req.body.email])`
By using `JSON.stringify()` function, you are converting the `req.body.tag_id` value to a JSON object, which is what the array literal expects.
Also, you are not escaping the single quote in the string literal, you can use the `escape` method to escape the single quote.
`[req.body.tag_id, req.body.email])` to `['' + JSON.stringify(req.body.tag_id) + ''', req.body.email])`
It's important to note that you should avoid using string literals for JSON objects in PostgreSQL, as it can lead to other errors and issues in the future. It's better to use the JSON function to convert the JSON objects to the correct format for the array literal.
Additionally, you can also use ` || req.body.tag_id` to handle the case when tag_id is empty, that way you won't get any error when you try to insert an empty array.
Answer: You are trying to insert a JSON object into a column that is defined as an array of character strings. In PostgreSQL, you can't insert a JSON object directly into an array column, you need to convert it to a string before inserting it.
You can use the `json` function to convert the JSON object to a string, like this:
change:
`[req.body.tag_id, req.body.email])`
to:
`[jsonb_encode(req.body.tag_id), req.body.email])`
The `jsonb_encode` function converts the JSON object to a JSON-compatible binary string.
Or you can use `json` function which is the same as `jsonb_encode` but it returns a JSON string instead of a JSON-compatible binary string.
 Change:
`[req.body.tag_id, req.body.email])`
to:
`[json(req.body.tag_id), req.body.email])`
It's important to note that you should use the correct data type for the column in your table, in this case, you are using a `char[]` data type, which means the column should only contain strings, not JSON objects. If you want to insert JSON objects into a column, you should use a different data type, like `jsonb`.",0.5144014358520508,"javascript, node.js, postgresql",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

How do I make it so that the owner of the s3 bucket can read what im writing into the bucket? Is this something they would have to change on their end since they are the owner or is this something I can change on my end?
I dont see the Bucket on my Amazon S3 buckets list because I am not the owner. Therefore, I cannot change the permissions there (or can I change the settings on an invisible bucket?).
","When uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket that belongs to a different account, use ACL=bucket-owner-full-control. This will 'handover' ownership of the object to the other account.
This is a very strange behaviour of Amazon S3 that they have now corrected by offering the ability to  disable ACLs and enforce the Bucket owner. If the owner of the bucket configures this setting, then it will work as expected (without needing to specify the ACL on upload).
See: Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket - Amazon Simple Storage Service
","  Ah, I see! It sounds like you're facing an issue with accessing someone else's Amazon S3 bucket, specifically when trying to write data into it. Here's some guidance on how to resolve this issue:
1. Check the bucket owner's permissions:
As you mentioned, since you're not the owner of the bucket, you can't change the bucket's permissions directly. However, the owner of the bucket can grant you access to the bucket and its contents. You can request the owner to grant you read and write permissions on their bucket.
2. Use IAM policies:
If you don't have direct access to the bucket owner, you can create an IAM policy that grants you permission to access the bucket. You can specify the actions you want to perform, such as reading or writing, and attach the policy to the bucket. The bucket owner will need to approve the policy before it takes effect.
3. Create a new bucket:
If you don't have access to the original bucket, you can create a new bucket and transfer the data to it. This way, you can have control over the data and its access permissions.
4. Contact the bucket owner:
If you're unable to access the bucket directly or create a new bucket, you can try contacting the bucket owner directly. They may be able to provide you with access to the bucket or help you find an alternative solution.

In summary, you can't change the permissions on someone else's bucket without their explicit permission. However, you can use IAM policies or create a new bucket to gain control over the data. If you're still having issues, you can reach out to the bucket owner for assistance.",0.7571666240692139,"amazon-web-services, amazon-s3",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","The answersOptions is an array with objects inside, so you need to map through this array and display the object.answerText.
Code:

            &lt;&gt;
              &lt;h3&gt;{item.questionText}&lt;/h3&gt;

                {item.answerOptions.map((ans) =&gt; {
                  return (
                    &lt;&gt;
                      &lt;input
                        type=&quot;radio&quot;

            &lt;/&gt;
          );
        })}

","  It looks like you are trying to display multiple choice questions with possible answer options in your `QuestionModule`. To achieve this, you can use the `Radio` component in React, which allows users to select a single option from a list of choices.
Here's an example of how you can modify your `QuestionModule` to display answer options as radio buttons:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
const QuestionModel = ({ questions }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;modal-body&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div className=&quot;app&quot;&gt;
        {questions.map((item) =&gt; {
          return (
            &lt;&gt;
              &lt;h3&gt;{item.questionText}&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;Radio label={item.answerOptions[0].answerText} value={item.answerOptions[0].id} onChange={() =&gt; { console.log('Answer selected:', item.answerOptions[0].answerText) }} &gt;&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
            {item.answerOptions.map((option) =&gt; {
              return (
                &lt;&lt;div&gt;{option.answerText}&lt;/div&gt;
              );
            })}
        );
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

```
In this example, we've added a `Radio` component inside the `QuestionModule` for each `answerOptions` list. The `Radio` component has a `label` prop that contains the text of the option, and a `value` prop that sets the ID of the option. The `onChange` prop is called when the user selects an option, and it logs the selected answer text to the console.
Note that we're using the `map` method to loop through each `answerOptions` list and create a `Radio` component for each option. We're also using JSX to render the `Radio` component inside the `QuestionModule`.
You can also add validation to make sure that the user has selected only one option. You can do this by checking the `value` prop of the `Radio` component and making sure it's unique among all the options.",0.7785854935646057,"javascript, html, reactjs",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73772360,Is there a limit to number of redirect URIs that you can register with OAuth2 provider?,"As the title of the question, is there a limit to number of callback/redirect URIs that you can register with OAuth2 IDP provider like Okta, Google, etc?
I need to know this limit as I am building suite of web applications deployed on separate subdomains but need them to share the same session. My thought is to share the same client id and client secret with all these apps so that access_token and refresh_token can be reused.
","The specification does not limit this. A client can have as many redirect URIs as it wishes. Concrete authorization server might have their own limits. You would have to check with each vendor separately to verify the limit of redirect URIs they allow.
Maybe a better solution would be to have one app that is responsible for obtaining the tokens and then it could establish a session with all the different applications. I think having one backend responsible for handling a session is better than relying on the lifespan of an access token. In fact, access tokens are not meant as a session-carrying mechanism. They are not related to user sessions, and you should rely on other tools for that. You can still use Google to verify the identity of a user, but you should handle the session separately.
","  Yes, there is a limit to the number of callback or redirect URIs that you can register with an OAuth2 provider, including Okta, Google, and other providers. The limit varies depending on the provider and their specific documentation, but here are some general guidelines:
1. Google OAuth2: Google allows you to register up to 100 different redirect URIs for a single client ID. You can find more information in the Google OAuth 2.0 documentation.
2. Okta OAuth2: Okta allows you to register up to 50 different redirect URIs for a single client ID. You can find more information in the Okta OAuth 2.0 documentation.
3. Other OAuth2 providers: Each OAuth2 provider may have their own limit on the number of redirect URIs that can be registered. It's important to check the documentation for each provider you're working with to determine their specific limit.
It's important to note that the number of redirect URIs you can register is not the only factor that determines how many applications you can build with a single client ID and secret. Another important consideration is the scope of the applications you're building. Some OAuth2 providers may allow you to register multiple scopes for a single client ID, which can help you build more applications without exceeding the limit on redirect URIs.
Now, let's talk about your approach of sharing the same client ID and secret across multiple applications. This approach is generally not recommended, as it can create security risks and lead to unauthorized access to user data. Here's why:
1. Security risks: If you share the same client ID and secret across multiple applications, an attacker could potentially gain access to all of these applications by stealing the client ID and secret. This could lead to unauthorized access to user data and other security breaches.
2. Session reuse: As you mentioned, you want to share the same session across multiple applications to avoid having to authenticate users multiple times. However, this approach can also lead to session replay attacks, where an attacker could use a stolen session to gain unauthorized access to user data.
Instead of sharing the same client ID and secret across multiple applications, you may want to consider the following alternatives:
1. Use a dedicated client ID and secret for each application: This approach ensures that each application has its own unique client ID and secret, which helps prevent security risks and session replay attacks.
2. Use a centralized authentication system: Instead of using OAuth2 for authentication, you could use a centralized authentication system like OpenID Connect orSAML. This approach allows you to manage user authentication and authorization in a single location, reducing the risk of security breaches and session replay attacks.
3. Implement authorization flows: Instead of using OAuth2 for access tokens, you could use authorization flows like the authorization code flow or the implicit flow. These flows allow you to grant permissions to applications without sharing the client ID and secret, reducing the risk of security breaches.
In conclusion, while there may be a limit to the number of redirect URIs you can register with an OAuth2 provider, it's important to prioritize security and user privacy when building applications. Sharing the same client ID and secret across multiple applications can create security risks and session replay attacks, so it's best to use dedicated client IDs and secrets for each application or implement alternative authentication flows.",0.6492529511451721,"authentication, oauth-2.0, google-oauth",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
72901581,Host identification in Docker container,"PROBLEM:
My application consists of one server and two clients which can be run on Windows, Linux, MAC operating systems. My goal is for the server to be able to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host or different ones. When clients work outside of a container, this can be done easily (for example, using a /etc/machine-id). The problem arises when containers come into play. The same /etc/machine-id is no longer unique across containers.
RESTRICTIONS:
The environment of docker containers cannot be changed (that is, it is not possible to use environment variables or volumes)
QUESTION:
Is there a way, maybe OS-specific or not, to identify a host that is independent of whether containerization is used or not?
","SOLUTION:
I used the host boot time to identify the host. Windows, Linux and MAC provide ways to get this information. These methods return the boot time of the host when called from a container. This is not a completely accurate solution to my problem, since there is some possibility that the hosts were running at the same time, but this probability is small enough to be neglected.
","  Yes, there are a few ways to identify the host that are independent of containerization. Here are a few options:
1. Hardware UUID:
On most modern operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, each physical host has a unique hardware universal unique identifier (UUID) that can be used to identify the host. You can use the following command to retrieve the hardware UUID on Linux: `ls /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep -i uuid`. On Windows, you can use the `wmic uuid` command. On macOS, you can use the `sysctl` command followed by the `hnadler` command.
Once you have the hardware UUID, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the UUID in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
2. MAC Address:
Another way to identify the host is by using the MAC address of the network interface card (NIC). Every network interface card has a unique MAC address, which can be used to identify the host. You can use the following command on Linux to retrieve the MAC address: `ip link show | grep -i mac`. On Windows, you can use the `ipconfig` command. On macOS, you can use the `ifconfig` command.
Once you have the MAC address, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the MAC address in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
3. IP Address:
You can also use the IP address of the host to identify it. Every host has a unique IP address that can be used to identify it. You can use the `ipaddr` command on Linux to retrieve the IP address of the host. On Windows, you can use the `ipconfig` command. On macOS, you can use the `ifconfig` command.
Once you have the IP address, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the IP address in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
4. UUID of the host's root partition:
Another way to identify the host is by using the UUID of the host's root partition. You can use the `blkid` command on Linux to retrieve the UUID of the root partition. On Windows, you can use the `fsutil` command. On macOS, you can use the ` Disk Utility` command.
Once you have the UUID of the root partition, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the UUID in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
5. Timestamps:
You can use timestamps to identify the host. When a client boots up, it generates a unique timestamp that can be used to identify the host. You can use the `uname` command on Linux and macOS, or the `systeminfo` command on Windows to retrieve the timestamp.
Once you have the timestamp, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the timestamp in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
6. System Information:
You can also use system information such as the hostname, operating system, and kernel version to identify the host. You can use the `uname` command on Linux and macOS, or the `systeminfo` command on Windows to retrieve this information.
Once you have the system information, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the system information in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
7. Fingerprinting:
Another approach is to use fingerprinting techniques to identify the host. Fingerprinting involves generating a unique identifier for the host based on its system configuration, hardware, or other attributes. You can use a tool such as `fping` to generate a fingerprint of the host.
Once you have the fingerprint, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the fingerprint in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
8. Network Information:
You can also use network information such as the IP address of the host, the MAC address of the NIC, or the network interface card (NIC) to identify the host.
Once you have the network information, you can use it to identify the host. You can store the network information in a configuration file or database, and use it to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host.
It's important to note that these methods are not foolproof, and there may be situations where multiple hosts have the same hardware UUID, MAC address, or IP address. Therefore, you should use multiple methods to identify the host, and not rely on a single method alone.",0.5658780336380005,docker,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  The issue you are encountering is due to the incorrect syntax in your Thymeleaf templating language. You are trying to use the `lists.isEmpty()` method, but it is not a validSpringEL expressions.
The correct syntax for checking if a list is empty in Thymeleaf is `#{list.isEmpty()}`.
In your case, you can use the following code:
```
<h2 th:if=""${#numbers.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">No hay personas</h2>
<div th:if=""${#numbers.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">
</div>
```
In this code, `listPersons` is the name of the list and `#numbers.isEmpty()` is the SpringEL expression that checks if the list is empty.
Another approach you can use is to check if the list is empty using the `size()` method:
```
<h2 th:if=""${listPersons.size() == 0}"">No hay personas</h2>
<div th:if=""${listPersons.size() == 0}"">
</div>
```
In this case, `listPersons.size()` will return the number of elements in the list, and if it is equal to 0, the `th:if` will evaluate to true.
It is important to note that the `size()` method will only work if the list is not null or empty, so you should check if the list is not empty before using the `size()` method.
Also, you can use SpringEL expressions in the `th:if` and `th:while` tags, but you need to use the `#` symbol before the SpringEL expression.

When the code hits this line, it exits with no further information:
var currentResultSet = await queryResultSetIterator.ReadNextAsync();

To verify something was working, I created this snippet:
this.cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(EndpointUri, PrimaryKey);
this.container = cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, containerId);

// This code worked and I verified results in data explorer
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deleteme&quot;);

EDIT 1
After playing with this for a bit.  I am encountering behavior I would not normally expect to see.  A bit of boring background:

I am doing TDD with a unit test project for a .NET 6 library
I am testing a class implementing an interface that hides the DB from the caller
Class has a constructor and a single async method

This TEST code in the constructor works:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
deltest.DeleteContainerAsync().Wait();

This TEST code in the async method exits the unit test project debug mode instantly:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
await deltest.DeleteContainerAsync();

I am recreating containers using data explorer between invocations.
","FACEPALM
After looking at this: Cosmos DB call never returns with async call
Remember kids: A unit test project example test method isn't async when you first create the class.
Changing the test method to async and adding await fixed the issue.
","  Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the Cosmos DB container being unreachable or not accessible. Here are some potential solutions to investigate:
1. Check if the container is actually created:
It's possible that the container is not created in Cosmos DB, which could cause the `ReadContainerAsync()` method to throw an exception. Check the Cosmos DB console or the Data Explorer in the Azure portal to verify if the container is created and accessible.
2. Verify the container endpoint:
Make sure that the container endpoint is correct and accessible. The endpoint should be in the format of `https://<account-name>.documents.azure.com:443/cosmosdb/<database-id>/<container-id>`.
3. Check the network connectivity:
Ensure that the machine running the application has network connectivity to the Cosmos DB endpoint. You can check the network connectivity by running `ping` command in the Command Prompt or PowerShell console.
4. Verify if the container is in the correct state:
Cosmos DB containers go through different states, such as Creating, Updating, and Deleting. It's possible that the container is in a state that does not allow it to be accessed. Check the Cosmos DB console or the Data Explorer to verify the state of the container.
5. Check for any network issues:
Network issues can cause Cosmos DB containers to become unreachable. Check for any network issues in the Azure portal or in the Cosmos DB console.
6. Check for any database or container API version issues:
Make sure that the version of the Azure Cosmos DB SDK you are using is compatible with the version of the Cosmos DB API that is being used.
7. Check for any authentication or authorization issues:
Make sure that the application has the correct authentication and authorization credentials to access the Cosmos DB container.
8. Check for any container quota issues:
Make sure that the container has enough quota to allow the application to access it. Check the Cosmos DB console or the Azure portal for quota information.
9. Check for any container backup or restore issues:
Make sure that the container is not in a backup or restore state. Check the Cosmos DB console or the Azure portal for backup and restore information.
10. Try restarting the application:
Sometimes, the application might just need a fresh start to work correctly. Try restarting the application or the service hosting the application to see if that resolves the issue.
If none of the above solutions work, you can try debugging the application to see if there are any issues with the code or the environment that could be causing the problem.",0.6309460997581482,"c#, azure, azure-cosmosdb-sqlapi",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Y = []
Z = []

plt.show()

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your K-means clustering analysis!
Firstly, let me confirm that you have indeed implemented the K-means elbow plot correctly. From what you've described, you have:
1. Performed PCA on your data to reduce the dimensionality.
2. Computed the covariance matrix of the PCA-transformed data.
3. Plotted the elbow plot, which shows the point of inflection (where the variance of the data decreases rapidly) as a function of the number of clusters (K).
Now, let's interpret your elbow plot and determine the optimum value of K for your data:
The elbow plot you provided shows a clear inflection point around K = 3, indicating that the variance of the data decreases rapidly after 3 clusters. This suggests that K = 3 may be a good choice for your data.
However, as you mentioned, when you visualize the data in the PCA-1 vs. PCA-2 plot, it seems that the data can be clustered into 2 clusters only. This raises the question: Is K = 3 really the best value for your data, or can you get even better results with a smaller value of K?
To address this, you can try reducing K further and see if the clustering results improve. For instance, you can try K = 2 or K = 1 and see if the clusters are more distinct and separable.
Alternatively, you can use techniques like the Elbow-Curve-Fitting method to determine the optimum value of K based on the curvature of the elbow plot. This method involves fitting a curve to the elbow plot and identifying the point where the curve flattens out as the optimal value of K.
In summary, while the elbow plot suggests K = 3 as a good starting point, you may want to experiment with smaller values of K to see if you can achieve better clustering results. Additionally, you can use other methods to determine the optimum value of K that best suits your data.",0.5495405197143555,"python, k-means, pca",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Following test case fails because I was expecting to have the productId populated in the ProductLine object but it is not. Is this the expected behavior of Spring Data JDBC?

Yes, if you want a productId you have to (and can easily) populate it yourself using plain Java code.
But you really shouldn't need the productId in the first place since if you follow Domain Driven Design, you will access a ProductLine exclusively from a Product which already has the id at hand.
The article https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/22/spring-data-jdbc-how-do-i-make-bidirectional-relationships might be helpful.

If I change Set&lt;ProductLine&gt; to List&lt;ProductLine&gt;, it fails due to JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException, which means the product id set to 0 as seen in the log snippet below.

You have two problems here:

You already have two sources for the product_id field: The relation from the aggregate root and the simple field, which may cause problems.

You mapped both the back reference to the aggregate root idColumn and the index of the list keyColumn to the same database column. Together with the simple field from above these are three values all mapped to the same column. Not good.
The value that seems to win is the list index, resulting in the exception.
In order to fix that, create an additional column in the product_line table and map the list index to it.


","  Thank you for providing the details of the issues you are facing with Spring Data JDBC and its entities. Based on the information provided, I will address both problems and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.
Problem 1: Why is the `productId` not populated in the `ProductLine` object when using ` '@Singular'` annotation?
The reason why the `productId` is not populated in the `ProductLine` object when using `@Singular` annotation is because Spring Data JDBC does not support the use of `@Id` annotation on a nested entity. The `@Id` annotation is only supported on top-level entities, not on nested entities.
In your case, you have defined `ProductLine` as a nested entity of `Product`, and as a result, `@Id` annotation on `ProductLine` is not recognized by Spring Data JDBC. To populate the `productId` field in the `ProductLine` object, you can remove the `@Id` annotation from the `ProductLine` entity and use the `@JoinColumn` annotation instead.
Here's an example of how you can modify your `ProductLine` entity to populate the `productId` field:
```@Data
    @JoinColumn(name = ""product_id"")
    private Product product;
    private String label;
    // ... getters and setters
```

 Problem 2: Why is Spring Data JDBC throwing a `JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException` when attempting to insert a new `ProductLine` object with a `productId` of 0?

The reason Spring Data JDBC is throwing a `JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException` when attempting to insert a new `ProductLine` object with a `productId` of 0 is because the `productId` column is defined as `NOT NULL` in the `ProductLine` table, andSpring Data JDBC is trying to insert a value of 0 into a column that is restricted to not allow null values.
To resolve this issue, you can either modify the `ProductLine` entity to allow null values for the `productId` field, or you can use the `ONLY_COUNT_ROWS` option in the `INSERT` statement to silence the exception.
Here's an example of how you can modify your `ProductLine` entity to allow null values for the `productId` field:
```@Data
    @JoinColumn(name = ""product_id"")
    @Nullable
    private Product product;
    private String label;
    // ... getters and setters
```

Alternatively, you can use the `ONLY_COUNT_ROWS` option in the `INSERT` statement to silence the exception:
```@SpringBootTest
    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    @Test
    void saveTest() {

        Product product = Product.builder()
                .name(&quot;Product-1&quot;)
                .description(&quot;Description&quot;)
                .line(ProductLine.builder()
                        .label(&quot;Line-label&quot;)
                        .productId(null) // <-- Modified to allow null value for productId
                        .build())
                .build();

        this.productRepository.save(product);

        assertThat(product.getProductId()).isNotNull();
        assertThat(product.getLines()).isNotNull().isNotEmpty().hasSize(1);
        assertThat(product.getLines().stream().findFirst()).isPresent();
        assertThat(product.getLines().stream().findFirst().get().getProductId()).isNotNull().isEqualTo(product.getProductId()); // -----&gt; As expected

    }

74286842,How to not return a key if its value is None in a recursive function,"I have return statement within a recursive function that looks like this:
def recursive_function(data):
....
return {f'uid': uid,'title': title, 'string': string,'create-time': create_time, 'edit-time': edit_time, 'children': children, 'refs': refs}

Sometimes some of these values can be None (ex: when the title has a value, the string's value will be None, and vice-versa). The application I'm using does not recognize keys with None values, how do I prevent those keys from returning when the values are None?
Thank you in advance.
","You can achieve this using dictionary comprehension:
return {key:value for key,value in {f'uid': uid,'title': title, 'string': string,'create-time': create_time, 'edit-time': edit_time, 'children': children, 'refs': refs}.items() if value is not None }


","  To avoid returning a key if its value is `None` in a recursive function, you can use an optional chaining syntax in Python 3.x, like this:
```
def recursive_function(data):
    # ...
    return {k: v for k, v in data.items() if v is not None}

In this implementation, the `items()` method is used to iterate over the dictionaries values, and the `if v is not None` check is used to filter out the keys with `None` values.
Alternatively, you can use the `or` operator to check if the value is `None` or `False`, like this:
```
def recursive_function(data):
    # ...
    return {k: v for k, v in data.items() if v is not None or v is False}

In this implementation, the `or` operator is used to check if the value is `None` or `False`, which will exclude the keys with `None` values.
Both of these implementations will return a dictionaries with only the keys that have a non-`None` value associated with them.
Note: In Python 2.x, you can use the `if v` syntax instead of `if v is not None` to check if the value is `None`.",0.597281813621521,"python, json, python-3.x",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  It seems that the issue you're facing is that the filter is not being applied to the report data when you use the ` PowerBIEmbed` component. This is likely due to the fact that the `PowerBIEmbed` component uses a different technology stack than Power BI, and the filter options are not supported in the embedded report.
To fix this issue, you can use the `PowerBiEmbed` component's `Filters` prop to pass a custom filter function that will be applied to the report data. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to do this:
1. First, create a new function that will filter the report data based on the `Id` column:
```
const filterFunction = (data) => {
    return data.filter((item) => {
        return item.CustomColumnJson.Id.includes('XYZ');
    });
```
1. Next, pass this function to the `Filters` prop of the `PowerBIEmbed` component:

```
<PowerBIEmbed embedConfig={{ ... */
    filters: [filterFunction],
```

In this example, the `filterFunction` is a function that takes the report data as an argument and filters it based on the `Id` column. The ` includes` method is used to check if the `XYZ` value is present in the `Id` column of each item in the report data.
By passing this custom filter function to the `Filters` prop, the report data will be filtered before it is displayed in the embedded report.
Note that this approach requires a bit more effort to set up than simply applying the filter using the `filters` property of the `PowerBIEmbed` component, but it should provide more reliable results.",0.7041711807250977,"reactjs, powerbi, powerbi-embedded, powerbi-custom-visuals",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I tried something like this:
 SELECT * FROM  table_name t where t.numbers @&gt; '2 414 425'
But it doesnt return anything even when it should.
","The @&gt; operator needs a proper JSON object on the right hand side:
where t.numbers @&gt; '[&quot;2 414 425&quot;]'

This should work if numbers is defined as jsonb (which it should be). Otherwise cast it numbers::jsonb
Checking if at least one of multiple keys is contained in the JSON array can be done using the ?| operator:
where t.numbers ?| array['2 414 425', '13261999']

The ?&amp; operator will check if all those keys are contained in the JSON array.
","  The issue here is that you are using the `>` operator in your query, which is not the correct way to search for a value in a JSONB array.
In PostgreSQL, you can use the `->>` operator to search for a value in a JSONB array. Here's an example:
SELECT * FROM table_name t WHERE t.numbers ->> '2 414 425'
This will return all rows where the `numbers` column contains the value '2 414 425'.
Note that the `numbers` column needs to be a JSONB of strings, and the value you are searching for needs to be a string as well. If the value you are searching for is an integer, you will need to enclose it in quotes, like this: `t.numbers ->> '2414425'`.
Also, make sure that the column `t.numbers` is a JSONB column, if it's not then you need to convert it to a JSONB column by using the `jsonb_array_elements()` function.
For example:
SELECT * FROM table_name t WHERE jsonb_array_elements(t.numbers) ->> '2 414 425';
This will return all rows where the `numbers` column contains the value '2 414 425'.
You can also use `any()` function to check if the array contains a value.
Example:
SELECT * FROM table_name t WHERE any(t.numbers ->>'2 414 425');
This will return all rows where the `numbers` column contains the value '2 414 425'.

74591448,"Why is my Either-returning method always returning Left, irrespective of what happened?","The use case here is that I have added a method to an Entity Framework DbContext that does some extra work before saving, and then returns an Either depending on the results. A very simplified version of this looks like this...
static async Task&lt;Either&lt;string, Unit&gt;&gt; SaveChangesAsyncEither(string userId) {
  // In reality, this would do some auditing, check for concurrency issues, and
  // attempt to save the changes. It would return unit if all went OK, 
  // or an error message if not. Simple check for demonstrating the issue...
  if (userId == &quot;jim&quot;) {
    return &quot;We don't like Jim&quot;;
  }
  return unit;
}

This method is used in many places in my solution, and wors fine.
In one minimal API project, I have a method that looks like this (again, highly simplified)...
static async Task&lt;Either&lt;DeviceApiResponseStates, DeviceApiResponseStates&gt;&gt; CreateDevice(string userId) {
  // In reality we would have more parameters, create a device, etc before
  // calling SaveChangesAsyncEither
  return (await SaveChangesAsyncEither(userId))
      .Match(() =&gt; Right&lt;DeviceApiResponseStates, DeviceApiResponseStates&gt;(DeviceApiResponseStates.OK),
        _ =&gt; Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah));
}

...where DeviceApiResponseStates is an enum. For simplicity, you can imagine it looks like this...
enum DeviceApiResponseStates {
  OK,
  Nah
}

Those three code blocks are a complete sample of my problem.
I would expect that if I call CreateDevice(&quot;jim&quot;), then I would get a Left with a value of Nah, and if I call it with any other string value, I would get a Right with a value of OK.
However, when I try this...
Console.WriteLine((await CreateDevice(&quot;&quot;))
  .Match(_ =&gt; &quot;Yeah&quot;, ex =&gt; $&quot;Exception: {ex}&quot;));

... I get Nah, irrespective of the string value.
Anyone able to explain what I'm doing wrong?
",,"  The issue you're facing is that the `Match` method in the `Either` monad is not working as expected. You're using it to destructure the `Either` value and return a value based on the result of the `Match` call. However, the `Match` method is not able to distinguish between a `Left` and a `Right` value of different types.
In your case, you're trying to match the `Either` value against a value of type `DeviceApiResponseStates`, but the `Match` method is not able to determine whether the `Left` value is of type `DeviceApiResponseStates` or any other type. Therefore, it's always returning `Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah)`.
To fix this issue, you can use the `TryMatch` method instead of `Match`. The `TryMatch` method will return `True` if the `Either` value can be matched against the given value, and `False` otherwise. Here's an example of how you can use `TryMatch` to fix your code:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine((await CreateDevice(&quot;&quot;))
  .TryMatch(_ =&gt; &quot;Yeah&quot;, ex =&gt; $&quot;Exception: {ex}&quot;));
```
Now, when you call `TryMatch`, it will check whether the `Either` value can be matched against the given value. If it can, it will return the matched value, otherwise it will return `Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah)`.
Another option is to use the `map` method to transform the `Either` value into a different type. For example, you can use `map` to convert a `Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah)` value into a `DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah` value, like this:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine((await CreateDevice(&quot;&quot;))
  .Map(Left =&gt; DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah));
```
By using `map`, you can transform the `Either` value into a value of the desired type, regardless of whether it's a `Left` or `Right` value.

","  You're close! You can use the `numpy.array_split()` function to split the main array into n sub-arrays, and then use a list comprehension to combine the sub-arrays into a single 2D array. Here's an updated version of your function that should work:
```
def split(arr, n):
    output = numpy.array_split(arr, n)
    return [numpy.array([row]) for row in zip(*output)]
```
In this updated version, we first use `numpy.array_split()` to split the main array into n sub-arrays. Then, we use a list comprehension to create a list of 2D arrays, where each element in the list is the concatenation of the rows of a corresponding sub-array. The `zip()` function is used to concatenate the rows of each sub-array.
For example, if `arr` is a 3D array with shape `(10, 3, 4)`, `n` is 3, and the output is stored in `output`, then the output would be:

output = [
    [[0, 1, 2, 3],

","After some research i got this :
Those are Kubernetes-style quantities, Instead of displaying things as a decimal, it will display with SI suffixes. For instance, 1.5 becomes 1500m. When Kubernetes displays a quantity, it will tend to use milli-units if there would be a decimal point, and plain units otherwise. So, if it had to display 500 on the dot, it would just display 500, but if it's 500.5, it would display 500500m. So m means divide by 1000, k means times 1000. There's no documentation really except this. Search for &quot;Kubernetes-style quantities&quot; if you want to see more examples.
1m/750m = (1/1000)/(750/1000) = 0.001/.75 = .1%/75%
refer this link also
","  The units ""m"" and ""k"" are commonly used in Kubernetes to represent multipliers for various scaling parameters, such as the number of replicas or the resource requests for a pod.
The ""m"" unit represents a multiplication factor of 10, so if you set a value of ""5m"", for example, it means 50 replicas or 50% of the requested resources for a pod.
Similarly, the ""k"" unit represents a multiplication factor of 1000, so ""5k"" means 5000 replicas or 5000% of the requested resources for a pod.
In the image you provided, the value ""m=10"" means that the horizontal pod autoscaler should scale the replicas of the pod by a factor of 10 if any of the conditions are met, while ""k=100"" means that the replicas should be scaled by a factor of 100 if any of the conditions are met.
There is no official documentation on the ""m"" and ""k"" units in Kubernetes, as they are not official Kubernetes concepts. They are more of a convention or shorthand used by some Kubernetes users and operators to simplify the configuration of horizontal pod autoscaling.
The ""Mi"", ""Gi"", etc. units you mentioned are official Kubernetes concepts that were introduced in Kubernetes 1.12 for scaling with customized resource requests and limits. They are used to scale pods based on a combination of the pod's request and the available resources in the cluster.
In summary, the ""m"" and ""k"" units are not official Kubernetes concepts, but rather a convention used by some users to simplify the configuration of horizontal pod autoscaling.",0.7635340690612793,"kubernetes, horizontalpodautoscaler",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

&amp; is put twice to provide escaping for the substitution character
\d represents digits and the following + provides the multiple occurrences of them
ending the pattern with ;

or just use a single ampersand ('&amp;#\d+;') for the pattern as in the case of Demo , since an ampersand has a special meaning for Oracle, a usage is a bit problematic.
","  You are correct that `rexp_replace` can be used to remove template text from a string in Oracle. Here's how you can use it to remove the text you described:
First, let's break down the pattern you want to match:
* `&amp;` matches the ""&"" character followed by a ""amp"" symbol (i.e., the ""&"" character itself, not the ""&"" symbol).
* `%;` matches the "")"" character followed by a ""%;"" character (i.e., the "")"" character itself, not the "";&"" symbol).
* `x` matches the character ""x"".
So, the pattern you want to match is: `(&amp;|%|x)`
Now, you can use `rexp_replace` with the following syntax:
```
BEGIN
  -- Replace pattern with replacement
  VARCHAR2 := rexp_replace(your_string, '(&amp;|%|x)', '');
END;
```
Here, `your_string` is the string you want to modify, and `rexp_replace` replaces every occurrence of the pattern you specified (which is `(&amp;|%|x)`) with an empty string.
Here are a few examples of how you can use this code:
```
BEGIN
  -- Remove template text from a string
  VARCHAR2 := rexp_replace(
'H&amp;#39;ello wor&amp;#177;ld', '(&amp;|%|x)', '');
  DBMS_ Output.put_line(VARCHAR2);
END;
```
This code will remove the template text from the string `'H&amp;#39;ello wor&amp;#177;ld'` and return the modified string: `Hello world`.
Note that the `DBMS_Output.put_line` statement is used to display the modified string to the console.
Alternatively, you can assign the modified string to a variable and use it as needed:
```
BEGIN
  -- Remove template text from a string
  VARCHAR2 := rexp_replace(
'H&amp;#39;ello wor&amp;#177;ld', '(&amp;|%|x)', '');
  -- Use the modified string
  VARCHAR3 := VARCHAR2;
END;
```
In this case, the modified string `VARCHAR2` will be assigned to the variable `VARCHAR3`.

73541768,how can i access UIBezierPath that is drawn in draw(_ rect: CGRect)?,"I'm drawing lines with UIBezierPath in draw(_ rect: CGRect) method previously i did tried that with CAShapeLayer but i wasn't able to select particular path and move it so i'm trying this, but after drawing i'm not able to access that BezierPath from view's subviews or it's sublayers and not directly from UIView. How can i access that bezierpath drawn in drawRect method so i can change it's position according to touches.
private var bezierPaths: [MyBezierPath] = [MyBezierPath]()

    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
    super.draw(rect)
    UIColor.orange.set()
    for path in bezierPaths {
        path.lineWidth = 4
        path.lineCapStyle = .round
        path.lineJoinStyle = .round
        path.stroke()
    }
}

    func drawingPath(_ path: [MyBezierPath]) {
    bezierPaths = path
}

like creating CAShapeLayer and setting layer.path = BezierPath like this :
        let shapeLayer = CAShapeLayer()
        shapeLayer.lineWidth = 1
        shapeLayer.strokeColor = UIColor.black.cgColor
        shapeLayer.fillColor = UIColor.clear.cgColor
        shapeLayer.lineCap = .round
        shapeLayer.lineJoin = .round
        shapeLayer.lineDashPattern = [10, 10]
        shapeLayer.name = &quot;ShapeLayer&quot;
        self.canvas.layer.addSublayer(shapeLayer)
override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {

if canvas.layer.sublayers != nil &amp;&amp; canvas.layer.sublayers?.last?.name == &quot;ShapeLayer&quot; {
                guard let layer = canvas.layer.sublayers?.last as? CAShapeLayer else { return }
                layer.path = path.cgPath
            }
}

like this i can access layer.path but how can i do it for path drawn in draw(Rect:) method ?
","Depending on what you're actually trying to do, overriding draw(_:) may not be the best approach.
For example, if you want to animate the drawn paths, it will be much easier if you are using CAShapeLayer as sublayers, or using subviews.
Also, shape layers are highly optimized ... if you write your own draw / animate functions you risk ending up with lesser-optimized code.
However, whichever approach you take, to &quot;find the path&quot; you want to use contains(_ point: CGPoint)
For example, if you have an array of UIBezierPath, with all paths relative to the top-left (0,0) of the view, on touch you could do:
// find a path that contains the touch point
if let touchedPath = bezierPaths.first(where: {$0.contains(point)}) {
    // do something with that path
}

If the paths are not relative to the top-left of the view - for example, if the path is relative to the layer position, or is part of a subview - you'd need to convert the touch point.
Here's a quick example that looks like this - on load, and then after dragging a few shapes around:
 
We'll start with a simple &quot;path&quot; struct, which contains the bezier path and the color to use. We could add various other properties, such as line width, dash pattern, etc:
struct MyPath {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

then we'll use this UIView subclass that will handle the drawing, as well as touches began/moved/ended:
class BezDrawView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            setNeedsDisplay()
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        super.draw(rect)
        
        if myPaths.count &gt; 0 {
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                p.color.set()
                p.path.stroke()
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            self.activePath = touchedPath
            self.startPoint = point
            return
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        startPoint = point
        // this triggers draw(_:)
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // done dragging
        activePath = nil
    }
    
}

and an example controller which defines some sample shapes (paths):
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
        
        let testBezDrawView = BezDrawView()
        testBezDrawView.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 0.1, alpha: 1.0)
        testBezDrawView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.addSubview(testBezDrawView)
        
        let g = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            
            // constrain bez draw view to all 4 sides with 20-points &quot;padding&quot;
            testBezDrawView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.topAnchor, constant: 20.0),
            testBezDrawView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.leadingAnchor, constant: 20.0),
            testBezDrawView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.trailingAnchor, constant: -20.0),

        ])
        
        // add some sample path shapes and colors
        let colors: [UIColor] = [

        var i: Int = 0
        for (c, r) in zip(colors, rects) {
            var b = UIBezierPath()
            switch i % 4 {
            case 1:     // oval
                b = UIBezierPath(ovalIn: r)
            case 2:     // triangle shape
                b = UIBezierPath()
                b.move(to: CGPoint(x: r.minX, y: r.maxY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.midX, y: r.minY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.maxX, y: r.maxY))
                b.close()
            case 3:     // diamond
                b = UIBezierPath()
                b.move(to: CGPoint(x: r.minX, y: r.midY))

                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.midX, y: r.maxY))
                b.close()
            default:    // rect

            i += 1
        }
        testBezDrawView.myPaths = somePaths
    }
    
}

Here's a video of it in use (too big to convert to gif and embed here):

Edit in response to comment...
That needs very few changes to make it work with shape layers instead of draw(_:).
We can use the same Translation Transform to &quot;move&quot; the path, then update the .path property of that path's associated layer:
    let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
    active.path.apply(tr)
    activeLayer.path = activeParh.path.cgPath

I strongly, strongly recommend that you try to convert that sample code to shape layers on your own - it would be a good learning exercise.
But, if you run into trouble, here's a modified version...
First, we're going to use the. array index of the MyPath object to match with the sublayer index, so we need to make our struct Equatable:
struct MyPath: Equatable {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

Then some minor changes to BezDrawView -- which we'll name BezLayerView:
class BezLayerView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            // remove any existing layers
            if let subs = layer.sublayers {
                subs.forEach { lay in
                    lay.removeFromSuperlayer()
                }
            }
            // create layers for paths
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                let lay = CAShapeLayer()
                lay.lineWidth = 4
                lay.lineCap = .round
                lay.lineJoin = .round
                lay.lineDashPattern = [5, 10]
                lay.fillColor = UIColor.clear.cgColor
                lay.strokeColor = p.color.cgColor
                lay.path = p.path.cgPath
                layer.addSublayer(lay)
            }
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activeLayer: CAShapeLayer?
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first, let subs = layer.sublayers else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            // find the layer associated with that path
            if let idx = myPaths.firstIndex(of: touchedPath) {
                if let lay = subs[idx] as? CAShapeLayer {
                    self.activePath = touchedPath
                    self.activeLayer = lay
                    self.startPoint = point
                }
            }
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let lay = activeLayer, let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        lay.path = ap.path.cgPath
        startPoint = point
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // done dragging
        activeLayer = nil
        activePath = nil
    }
    
}

and an almost identical version of the controller:
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
        
        let testBezLayerView = BezLayerView()
        testBezLayerView.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 0.1, alpha: 1.0)
        testBezLayerView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.addSubview(testBezLayerView)
        
        let g = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            
            // constrain bez draw view to all 4 sides with 20-points &quot;padding&quot;
            testBezLayerView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.topAnchor, constant: 20.0),
            testBezLayerView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.leadingAnchor, constant: 20.0),
            testBezLayerView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.trailingAnchor, constant: -20.0),
            testBezLayerView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: g.bottomAnchor, constant: -20.0),
            
        ])
        
        // add some sample path shapes and colors
        let colors: [UIColor] = [
            .systemRed, .systemGreen, .systemBlue,
            .cyan, .magenta, .yellow, .orange, .green,

        let rects: [CGRect] = [

            CGRect(x: 180, y: 20, width: 40, height: 60),
            CGRect(x: 20, y: 120, width: 60, height: 100),
            CGRect(x: 200, y: 140, width: 50, height: 90),

            CGRect(x: 50, y: 360, width: 200, height: 100),
            CGRect(x: 150, y: 480, width: 120, height: 80),
        ]
        var somePaths: [MyPath] = []
        var i: Int = 0
        for (c, r) in zip(colors, rects) {
            var b = UIBezierPath()
            switch i % 4 {
            case 1:     // oval
                b = UIBezierPath(ovalIn: r)
            case 2:     // triangle shape
                b = UIBezierPath()
                b.move(to: CGPoint(x: r.minX, y: r.maxY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.midX, y: r.minY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.maxX, y: r.maxY))
                b.close()
            case 3:     // diamond
                b = UIBezierPath()
                b.move(to: CGPoint(x: r.minX, y: r.midY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.midX, y: r.minY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.maxX, y: r.midY))
                b.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: r.midX, y: r.maxY))
                b.close()
            default:    // rect
                b = UIBezierPath(rect: r)
            }
            let p = MyPath(color: c, path: b)
            somePaths.append(p)
            i += 1
        }
        testBezLayerView.myPaths = somePaths
    }
    
}

The output and functionality should be indistinguishable from the BezDrawView implementation.
","  Great, thank you for providing more details about your problem! It seems that you are trying to access the `UIBezierPath` that is drawn in the `draw(_:)` method, but you are not able to do so directly from the `UIView` instance.
The reason for this is that the `UIBezierPath` instance is created and drawn in the `draw(_:)` method, but it is not added to the view's sublayers or layers. Therefore, you cannot access it directly from the view instance.
However, there are a couple of ways you can handle this situation:
1. Add the `UIBezierPath` instance to the view's sublayers or layers:
You can add the `UIBezierPath` instance to the view's sublayers or layers by using the `addSublayer()` or `addLayer()` method of the `UIView` instance. Here's an example:
```swift
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        super.draw(rect)
        UIColor.orange.set()
        for path in bezierPaths {
            path.lineWidth = 4
            path.lineCapStyle = .round
            path.lineJoinStyle = .round
            path.stroke()
            // Add the path to the view's sublayers
            let shapeLayer = CAShapeLayer()
            shapeLayer.lineWidth = path.width
            shapeLayer.strokeColor = path.strokeColor
            shapeLayer.fillColor = path.fillColor
            shapeLayer.lineCap = path.lineCapStyle
            shapeLayer.lineJoin = path.lineJoinStyle
            shapeLayer.lineDashPattern = [path.lineDashPhase, path.lineDashPhase]
            shapeLayer.name = ""BezierPathLayer""
            self.layer.addSublayer(shapeLayer)
        }
    }
```
In this example, we create a `CAShapeLayer` instance and add it to the view's sublayers using the `addSublayer()` method. We set the layer's properties (line width, stroke color, fill color, line cap, line join, and line dash pattern) to match the `UIBezierPath` instance.
By adding the `UIBezierPath` instance to the view's sublayers or layers, you can access it easily by using the `layer.path` property.
2. Use a custom layer class:
You can create a custom layer class that inherits from `CALayer` and overrides the `draw(_:)` method to draw the `UIBezierPath` instance. Here's an example:
```swift

class BezierPathLayer: CALayer {
    var beamierPath: UIBezierPath {
        didSet {
            invalidate()
            drawBezierPath()
        }
    }

```
In this example, we create a custom `BezierPathLayer` class that inherits from `CALayer`. We define a `beamierPath` property that stores the `UIBezierPath` instance. We also define a `drawBezierPath()` method that draws the `UIBezierPath` instance using the `layer.path` property.
We override the `draw(_:)` method to draw the `UIBezierPath` instance, and we also override the `touchesMoved(_:with:)` method to update the `UIBezierPath` instance position when the user moves his finger.
By using a custom layer class, you can handle the `UIBezierPath` instance drawn in the `draw(_:)` method and update its position easily.

 InvalidArgumentException 

  The database configuration URL is malformed.

I already removed that line but now I can't clear the cache for the config and every time I do anything with artisan I get the same error even when I just run php artisan help , something like an infinite loop where laravel has to clear the cache to get rid of the bug but I can't clear it because of the bug
","Try
composer dump-autoload
php artisan config:cache

If it didn't work could you share the config file
","  Ah, I see! It sounds like you've accidentally added a wrong database URL configuration in your Laravel project's `config/database.php` file, and now you're getting an ""InvalidArgumentException"" when trying to run any Artisan command. Here's how you can fix this issue:
1. Remove the wrong database URL configuration:
Find the incorrect database URL configuration in your `config/database.php` file, and remove it. You can do this by searching for the wrong URL in the file and commenting it out using a comma ("","") at the end of the line. For example:
```php
// Replace this with your actual database URL
'database_url' => env('DATABASE_URL'),
// Remove the wrong URL configuration
', // <--------- Remove this line to get rid of the error

// Restart your server if you need to
```
2. Clear the cache for the `config` directory:

You can clear the cache for the `config` directory by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php artisan config:clear

This will clear the cache for all configurations in the `config` directory, including the database URL configuration.
3. Run the `php artisan migrate` command:
After clearing the cache, you can run the `php artisan migrate` command to update your database schema with any pending migrations. If you have any migrations pending, this command will run them automatically.
4. Check the database URL configuration again:
Once the migration process is complete, check the database URL configuration in your `config/database.php` file to ensure it's correct.
5. Test your application:
After fixing the database URL configuration, test your application to ensure everything is working as expected. Run the `php artisan serve` command to start the local development server, and test your application from your web browser.
That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ""InvalidArgumentException"" error caused by the wrong database URL configuration in your Laravel application.",0.6457025408744812,"php, laravel, laravel-artisan",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74189852,GitHub Pages absolute_url discrepancy,"I changed my GH Pages Source setting from &quot;classic&quot;/&quot;hands off&quot; to &quot;GitHub Actions (Beta)&quot;, and after some tweaking, everything is working the same again, except for one thing: when hosted on my-subdomain.github.io the link to the home page goes to github.com.
The anchor tag comes from jekyll-theme-primer's default.html layout and looks like this:
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ &quot;/&quot; | absolute_url }}&quot;&gt;

On my local machine (in Docker), this is fine and links to localhost:3000 and previously on GH Pages it linked to my-subdomain.github.io (and I named the repository the same) which was fine, but after the switch it links to github.com which is bad.
My GHA workflow is a straight copy of the official starter workflow which runs this command:
bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl &quot;${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}&quot;

And site.base_url is &quot;&quot; in all cases.
According to the Jekyll docs, absolute_url &quot;prepends url and base_url to the input&quot;. Why is url set to github.com now and what's the best way to fix it?
","I fixed it by adding _config-gh.yml with url set to the correct github.io subdomain and adding --config _config.yml,_config-gh.yml to the workflow command.
","  The issue you're experiencing is due to the change in the `Source` setting of your GitHub Pages configuration from `classic/hands off` to `GitHub Actions (Beta)`. When you set `Source` to `GitHub Actions (Beta)`, Jekyll uses the `github.com` base URL as the default base URL for linking.
To fix this issue, you can either:
1. Modify the `absolute_url` filter in your Jekyll theme to use the correct base URL for your GitHub Pages site.
In your Jekyll theme, you can add the following line of code to the `_layouts/default.html` file to modify the `absolute_url` filter:
```html
<a href=""{{ '/' | absolute_url }}"">
```
This will strip off the `github.com` base URL from the `absolute_url` output, so the links in your site will point to the correct domain.
1. Modify the `base_url` variable in your GHA workflow to use the correct base URL for your GitHub Pages site.
In your GHA workflow, you can add the following line of code to the `bundle exec jekyll build` command to modify the `base_url` variable:
```bash
 bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl $${steps.pages.outputs.base_path}
```
This will pass the correct base URL to Jekyll when building your site, so the links will point to the correct domain.

while time.time() &lt; timeout + start_time:
    # DO something
    flag = True
    break

if flag is False:
   print(f&quot;Timeout reached {timeout}&quot;)

With the current code, the timeout or the flag are not hit. Any hints of what it is wrong?
","I am going to post the solution that I have found and worked for me as in the #DO SOMETHING section I had some blocks of code that were using some libraries that were in conflict with multithreading public library:
import time

MAX_TIMEOUT = 5

start_time = time.time()
while True:
    time_delta = time.time() - start_time
    while time_delta &lt;= MAX_TIMEOUT:
        # DO SOMETHING

        if time_delta &gt; MAX_TIMEOUT:
            print(&quot;Timeout reached.&quot;)
            break

","  The issue with your code is that the `time.time()` function returns the number of seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC), and the `timeout` variable is set to 5 seconds.
In your code, the `while` loop will continue running indefinitely because the time.time() function is always less than or equal to the sum of the start time and the timeout.
To fix the issue, you can modify the condition of the `while` loop to check if the current time is greater than or equal to the timeout plus the start time, like this:
while time.time() >= timeout + start_time:
This will cause the loop to exit when the current time is greater than or equal to the timeout plus the start time, which is what you are trying to achieve.
Additionally, you can remove the `break` statement inside the loop, as it is not necessary and will cause the program to iterate indefinitely.
Here is the modified code:
import time
start_time = time.time()
flag = False
timeout = 5

while time.time() >= timeout + start_time:
    # DO something
flag = True

if flag is False:
   print(f&quot;Timeout reached {timeout}&quot;)

It's worth noting that in Python, you can also use the `time.sleep()` function to add a delay between loops, which can be useful in this case to prevent the loop from running too quickly. For example:
import time
start_time = time.time()
flag = False
timeout = 5

while time.time() >= timeout + start_time:
    # DO something
    time.sleep(1) # Add a delay of 1 second between loops
flag = True

if flag is False:
   print(f&quot;Timeout reached {timeout}&quot;)

This will cause the loop to iterate every second, instead of immediately, which can help prevent the loop from running too quickly and causing the timeout to be reached prematurely.",0.6495362520217896,"python, while-loop, timeout",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I have a model with an ImageField. I want to fill it with sample data. This is not  about testing. I just want to fill the database for development purposes. I saved some 50 jpg files and decided to add them programmatically.
I failed miserably. This code blows up with the exception:

What can I try next?
","f = open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), &quot;rb&quot;)

should do the trick. If not you can try to add the encoding standard like
f = open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), &quot;rb&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)

But I'm not sure if this even works with bytes, it might only work for &quot;r&quot;.
You should give the file also a name:
sample_img = File(f, img)

If you already have the model created you can slo save the file afterwards with:
phrase = Phrase.objects.get(pk=1)
phrase.upload_to.save(img, content=sample_img))

small edit:
you can faster create a new entry with the following command:
phrase = Phrase.objects.create(
    image=sample_img
)

","  The issue you're encountering is likely due to the encoding of the images in your `Phrase` model. The `ImageField` is expecting the images to be encoded in UTF-8, but the images you're providing are not in UTF-8 format.
To fix this issue, you can either:
1. Rename the images to have the correct encoding. For example, if the images are in ISO-8859-1 encoding, you can rename them to have the correct encoding prefix (e.g., ""ISO-8859-1"").
2. Use the `force_encoding` parameter of the `ImageField` to specify the encoding of the image file. For example:
`image = models.ImageField(blank=True, default="""", null=False, upload_to=UploadTo(folder=UPLOAD_TO.VOCABULARY_IMG_FOLDER).save_path, force_encoding=""utf-8"")`
By using the `force_encoding` parameter, you're telling Django to expect the image file to be encoded in UTF-8, even if the file itself is not in that encoding.
3. Use the `Image.open()` method with the `encoding` parameter to specify the encoding of the image file. For example:
`img = Image.open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), encoding=""utf-8"")`
By using the `encoding` parameter, you're telling Python to expect the image file to be encoded in UTF-8.

73669427,I can view httpOnly cookies in browser,"I thought that httpOnly cookies were only available to read in a http request. However, when I open up Firefox dev tools, I can see the cookies' value. Is this normal?
","Yes, that’s normal.you can access the cookies using the devtool.
","  Yes, you are correct that HTTP-only cookies are intended to be accessible only in HTTP requests and not in browser's dev tools. However, there are a few reasons why you might be able to view the value of HTTP-only cookies in your browser's dev tools:
1. Cookie scope: By default, HTTP-only cookies are only accessible in the same origin as the request that created them. However, if you set the `secure` attribute on the cookie, it will be accessible in subdomains of the originating domain, even if the request is made over a different protocol (e.g., from `https://www.example.com` to `http://www.example.com`).
2. Browser configuration: Some browsers may have custom configurations that allow them to view HTTP-only cookies in their dev tools, even though they are intended to be inaccessible. For example, in Firefox, you can configure your browser to show all cookies, including HTTP-only cookies, in the dev tools by going to about:preferences#security and checking the ""Show cookies insecurely"" checkbox.
3. Expired or stale cookies: If the cookie is expired or stale, it may still be stored in the browser's cookie store even though it should have been deleted. In this case, you may be able to view the cookie's value in the dev tools.
To fix the issue, you can try the following:
1. Set the `secure` attribute on the cookie to prevent it from being accessible in subdomains:
```javascript
const cookie = new Cookie('name', 'value', { secure: true });
```
2. Clear the browser's cookie store: You can do this by deleting the cookies in your browser's settings or by using the `clearcookies` command in the browser's dev tools.
3. Update your server-side code to ensure that only the intended parties can access the cookie's value. For example, you could use a secure connection (HTTPS) and implement server-side validation to ensure that only the intended parties can access the cookie's value.
It's important to note that HTTP-only cookies are intended to provide an additional layer of security by limiting access to the cookie's value to only the parts of the application that initiated the request. By making the cookie's value accessible in the dev tools, you may be compromising this security feature. Therefore, it's important to ensure that only the intended parties can access the cookie's value in order to maintain the expected level of security.",0.5285322666168213,"javascript, reactjs, cookies, next.js, web-development-server",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Here are the classes:

private BigDecimal deliveryServiceFee;

private DeliveryWindow deliveryWindow;
}

DeliveryWindow.java
package core.aggreagte

public class DeliveryWindow {
@DecimalMin(&quot;0.0&quot;)
private BigDecimal fee;
}

Summation of all three variables happens here in Calculator.java
Here is what I've got so far:
CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator.java
package core.calculator.cartEntry.impl;

import core.aggregate.CartEntry;
import core.aggregate.Fullfillment;
import core.aggregate.StoreDelivery;
import core.calculator.cartEntry.CartEntryCalculator

public class CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator implements CartEntryCalculator{
@Override
public void calculate(final CartEntry cartEntry {
          Optional.of(cartEntry).filter(fulfillment -&gt; Objects.nonNull(fulfillment.getFulfillment())).map(CartEntry::getFulfillment)
            .filter(storeDelivery -&gt; Objects.nonNull(storeDelivery.getStoreDelivery()))
            .map(Fulfillment::getStoreDelivery).filter(deliveryFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(deliveryFee.getCost()))
            .filter(serviceFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(serviceFee.getDeliveryServiceFee()))
            .map(StoreDelivery::getDeliveryWindow).filter(windowFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(windowFee.getFee()));
}
}

","Since you cannot modify these classes, you will need to rely on each of the getter methods of these classes. And, since all of the needed values are components and subcomponents of the CartEntry class, all you need is create a stream of all the fulfillments and use the getter methods to accumulate the sum of each of these values.
List&lt;CartEntry&gt; entries = List.of(new CartEntry(), new CartEntry());
        
double total =
    entries.stream()
        .mapToDouble(entry -&gt; entry.getTotalDeliveryFee()
            .add(entry.getFulfillment().getStoreDelivery().getCost()
                .add(entry.getFulfillment().getStoreDelivery()
                        .getDeliveryServiceFee().add(entry.getFulfillment()
                        .getStoreDelivery().getDeliveryWindow().getFee())))
            .doubleValue())
        .sum();     

That gathers all the totals from components and subcomponents of the CartEntry class.
One last observation: Since the classes are using annotations to guarantee &quot;not null&quot; objects and for decimal values to have a minimum value of 0.0, my assumption is that the use of Optional is really not needed. All subcomponents of CartEntry appear to be automatically created with a value of 0.0. If that assumption is correct, the above function should work perfectly as is. If the assumption is incorrect, then it will be required to  use Optional.of() and then return 0.0 for null decimal values.
","  Sure, I can help you with that! It looks like you have classes `CartEntry`, `Fulfillment`, `StoreDelivery`, and `DeliveryWindow` that represent different entities in your application, and you want to calculate the total delivery fee for a `CartEntry` by combining the costs of the `deliveryServiceFee` and `fee` from the `StoreDelivery` and `DeliveryWindow` entities, respectively.
To achieve this, you can use Java Streams to perform the calculation in a fluent and concise manner. Here's an example of how you could implement the `CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator` class:
```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;
public class CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator implements CartEntryCalculator {
    @Override
    public void calculate(final CartEntry cartEntry) {
        // Get the fulfillment objects from the cart entry
        Optional<Fulfillment> fulfillmentOptional = cartEntry.getFulfillment();
        if (fulfillmentOptional.isPresent()) {
            // Get the store delivery object from the fulfillment
            Optional<StoreDelivery> storeDeliveryOptional = fulfillmentOptional.get().getFulfillment();
            if (storeDeliveryOptional.isPresent()) {
                // Get the delivery window object from the store delivery
                Optional<DeliveryWindow> deliveryWindowOptional = storeDeliveryOptional.get().getStoreDelivery();
                if (deliveryWindowOptional.isPresent()) {
                    // Calculate the total delivery fee
                    cartEntry.setTotalDeliveryFee(deliveryWindowOptional.get().getFee().multiply(storeDeliveryOptional.get().getDeliveryServiceFee()));

                }
            }
        }
    }

}
```
In this implementation, we first check if there is a `fulfillment` object associated with the `cartEntry`. If there is, we retrieve the `storeDelivery` object from the `fulfillment` using `getFulfillment()`. If there is no `storeDelivery` object, we skip the calculation and move on to the next step.
We then repeat the same process to retrieve the `deliveryWindow` object from the `storeDelivery` using `getStoreDelivery()`, and calculate the total delivery fee by multiplying the `fee` from the `deliveryWindow` with the `deliveryServiceFee` from the `storeDelivery`. If there is no `deliveryWindow` object, we skip the calculation and move on to the next step.
Finally, we set the `totalDeliveryFee` field of the `cartEntry` to the calculated value.
Note that we're using the `Optional` type to represent the possibility that some of the objects may be `null`, and we're using `Stream.of()` to create a stream of the `fulfillment`, `storeDelivery`, and `deliveryWindow` objects. We're then using the `map()` method to apply the calculated `deliveryFee` and `serviceFee` to the `totalDeliveryFee` field of the `cartEntry`.",0.6700348854064941,"java, lambda, java-stream, option-type",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","I encourage you to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).
See this Python example.
ADCs means your code is unchanged whether you run it locally or on Google Cloud.
When you test your code off Google Cloud, you can export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json and ADC will use the exported credentials.
When you deploy your code to Google Cloud, ADC obtains the credentials (for the resource that's running the code) from Google's Metadata service.
For example, when you run ADC code on Compute Engine, ADC will obtain the instance's (!) Service Account.
You should try to always use instance|role-specific Service Accounts but the default Compute Engine account is a Service Account too and will work.
Be aware that you'll need to ensure that whatever Service Account(s) is/are used have the correct IAM permissions to access other services.
","  Yes, you can use the service account of a GCP VM (xxx-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com) instead of a JSON file to make API calls using Python. To do this, you can use the `google-cloud-identity` library instead of `google-oauth2client` library.
Here are the steps to follow:
1. Install the `google-cloud-identity` library:
```
pip install google-cloud-identity
```
2. Import the `google-cloud-identity` library in your Python script:
```python
from google.cloud import identity
```
3. Instead of using the `service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file()` method to load the credentials from a JSON file, you can use the `identity.get_credentials()` method to load the credentials from the VM's service account. Here's an example:
```python
credentials = identity.get_credentials('xxx-compute')
```
4. Use the `credentials` object to build the API client:
```python
service = discovery.build('cloudresourcemanager', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```
Here's an example of how the fully updated code might look like:
```python
from google.cloud import identity
import requests
import json
import re
import sys
import subprocess
import os
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

main_list = []

# Get the credentials from the VM's service account
credentials = identity.get_credentials('xxx-compute')

# Build the API client using the credentials
service = discovery.build('cloudresourcemanager', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

# Call the API using the service client
response = service.projects().zoneOperations().list(name='example-project', location='us-central1').execute()

# Print the API response
print(response)
```
In this example, we're using the `identity.get_credentials()` method to load the credentials from the VM's service account. We're then using these credentials to build the `APIClient` object using the `build()` method. Finally, we're calling the API using the `execute()` method.
Note that you'll need to replace `xxx-compute` with the actual service account email address of the VM that you want to use.

74204364,Is it OK to use Django development server for single-user applications?,"I'm developing an application that controls some piece of complex hardware and exposes a front-end to the users using Django, mainly for cross-platform and remote access reasons. Currently using Django templates, but soon with a separate front-end through DRF calls. My main points of interest are:

user management. Admin users have more access
session management. Ideally, one cannot login from multiple IPs at the same time.
web-socket support for asynchronous notifications and real-time monitoring.
asynchronous background operations. e.g. with celery workers

Note that the users of these application are the hardware operators which are usually no more than 3-5 tops, and most of the times, only one of them is actively working on it so no real user concurrency, neither real need to scale.
So my question is: Is there a real reason I would want to distribute my application using a production server such as gunicorn instead of simply running manage.py runserver?
","From django runserver documentation:

DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests. (And that’s how it’s gonna stay. We’re in the business of making Web frameworks, not Web servers, so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.)

The development server is not intended for use in production. It is not designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure. It does not support all the possible features of an HTTP server.
In short, python manage.py runserver may work until it breaks!!
","  Yes, there are several reasons why you may want to consider using Gunicorn instead of the built-in Django development server (manage.py runserver) for your single-user application:
1. **Multiple Instances:** Gunicorn allows you to run multiple instances of your Django application, which can be useful for load balancing or scaling your application. The built-in development server only supports a single instance.
2. **Classewise Memory Limit:** Gunicorn provides a classewise memory limit, which means you can limit the amount of memory each instance of your application can use. This can be useful for preventing your application from consuming all the available memory on your system.
3. **Error Handling:** Gunicorn provides better error handling compared to the built-in development server. It can handle several types of errors, such as seg faults, and can also restart failed workers automatically.
4. **Logging:** Gunicorn provides more advanced logging features compared to the built-in development server. You can configure Gunicorn to log errors and other events to a file or to a centralized logging system like Loggly or ELK.
5. **Task Queueing:** Gunicorn supports task queueing out of the box, which allows you to decouple your application's workflow from the HTTP request-response cycle. This means you can use Gunicorn to handle long-running background tasks, such as data processing or API calls, while keeping your front-end responsive.
6. **Background Tasks:** Gunicorn provides better support for background tasks compared to the built-in development server. You can use Gunicorn's `--background` flag to run tasks in the background, which can help improve your application's responsiveness.
7. **Celery Integration:** Gunicorn has built-in support for Celery, a popular task queueing and distributed task execution framework. This means you can use Gunicorn to run your Celery tasks, which can help you execute long-running tasks asynchronously.
8. **Debugging:** Gunicorn provides better debugging tools compared to the built-in development server. You can use Gunicorn's `--debug` flag to start your application in debug mode, which can help you identify and fix errors more easily.
Based on your application's requirements, it seems like you don't need to scale your application horizontally, so using the built-in development server (manage.py runserver) should be sufficient for your use case. However, if you decide to scale your application in the future, Gunicorn can be a good choice for running multiple instances of your application.",0.6380950808525085,"python, django, django-rest-framework, gunicorn",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

      Type 'T[string]' is not assignable to type 'string | number | symbol'.ts(2322)

","TypeScript is not happy because T[key] could theoratically be a type which is not string, number or symbol.
Imagine this call:
type SortOptions = makeSortOptions&lt;
  {
    albums: &quot;title&quot;
    tracks: &quot;title&quot; | &quot;artist&quot;
    zzz: { a: 123 }
  }
&gt;

It is totally valid to call makeSortOptions with this object, but the zzz property contains an object which can not be used as a key.

I would put the valid Keys in an extra type.
type Keys = &quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;

type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;Keys, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in Keys]: { [value in T[key]]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

Instead of mapping over keyof T (which could lead to non-keyable types), we map over Keys. And through the constraint T extends Record&lt;Keys, string&gt;, TypeScript knows that every key of Keys must lead to a string type.
Playground

You could also just intersect it with a string.
type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;&quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in keyof T]: { [value in T[key] &amp; string]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

Non-string types would then evaluate to never and would not show up in the type.

","  The issue you're facing is caused by the type of the object returned by the `map` function, which is inferred to be of type `T[key]`. The type `T[key]` is not assignable to the type `string | number | symbol` because `T` is a union type that can have different types as its members, and `key` is a variable that can take on any value, including a string, number, or symbol.
To fix the issue, you can change the type of the `map` function to use a type assertion to specify that the return value is of type `string | number | symbol`:
```typescript
type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;&quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in keyof T]: { [value in T[key]]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

type SortOptions = makeSortOptions&lt;
  {
    albums: &quot;title&quot;
    tracks: &quot;title&quot; | &quot;artist&quot;
  }
&gt;

const x: SortOptions = {
  albums: { title: &quot;descending&quot; },
  tracks: {
    artist: &quot;descending&quot;,
    title: &quot;ascending&quot;,
  },
}

const y: SortOptions = {
  albums: { title: &quot;space and time&quot; }, 
  tracks: {
    artist: &quot;foo&quot;,
    bar: &quot;ascending&quot;,
  },
}
```
Alternatively, you can use the `infer` keyword to tell TypeScript to infer the type of the return value of the `map` function to be of type `string | number | symbol`:
```typescript
type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;&quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in keyof T]: { [value in T[key]]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

type SortOptions = makeSortOptions&lt;
  {
    albums: &quot;title&quot;
    tracks: &quot;title&quot; | &quot;artist&quot;
  }
&gt;

const x: SortOptions = {
  albums: { title: & quot;descending&quot; },

  albums: { title: & quot;space and time&quot; }, 
  tracks: {
    artist: & quot;foo&quot;,
    bar: & quot;ascending&quot;,
  },
}

```
Either of these solutions should fix the issue. Note that using the `infer` keyword will assume that the return value of the `map` function is of type `string | number | symbol` without providing any explicit type information, so it may not be as robust as using a explicit type assertion.",0.851534366607666,"typescript, typescript-generics",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

1. Find the element containing the autocomplete option:
```
(//div[@id='autocomplete'])

# Select the subject from the options
option = driver.find_element_by_xpath(""//div[@id='autocomplete']/option[contains(.,'""+subject+""')]"")
option.click()

","Can you do something similar with pivot_wider and pivot_longer from the tidyr package? I haven't used the case/melt framework in some time, and I'm wondering if the language has moved away from it.
","  The error message you're seeing is caused by the fact that the `Year` column is of type `symbol`, which is a list of character strings. In R, the `list()` function is not able to handle lists of different types, so when you try to use it to convert the `Year` column to a data frame, it throws an error.
To fix this issue, you can use the ` aggregate()` function instead of `list()`, which is designed to handle lists of different types. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to avoid the error:
```
cast(pMaster, Year ~ result, value = ""PopVotes"", fun.aggregate = sum)
# or
cast(pMaster, Year ~ result, value = ""PopVotes"", fun.aggregate = list)
```
In this code, the `fun.aggregate = list` argument tells R to perform the aggregation on each level of the list in the `Year` column. This will allow R to properly handle the list of character strings in the `Year` column and avoid the `unimplemented type 'list' in 'listgreater'` error.
Alternatively, you can also use the `lapply()` function to iterate over the levels of the `Year` column and perform the aggregation on each level separately:
```
cast(pMaster, Year ~ result, value = ""PopVotes"", fun.aggregate = lapply)
```
In this code, the `fun.aggregate = lapply()` argument tells R to apply the aggregation function to each level of the list in the `Year` column separately. This will also allow R to properly handle the list of character strings in the `Year` column and avoid the error.

73235410,How do server programs work on Docker when *only* the listening port is mapped to the Docker host?,"This is just a conceptual question that I have been thinking about recently.
Say I'm running an Nginx container on Docker on a host. Normally, for this to work, we have to map ports like 80 and 443 to host container. This is because these are listening ports, and connections from the outside world to port 80 should be forwarded to port 80 of the container. So far so good.
But also: port 80 is just the listening socket, right? The listening socket only accepts the connection; after this any communication done between a client and the Nginx server is supposedly done on a different socket with a random port number (on the server side). This is to allow multiple connections, and to keep the listening port free to establish more connections, etc. This is where my issue comes in.
Say I'm a client and I connect to this Nginx server. As far as I understand, I first send TCP packets to port 80 of the host that is hosting this Nginx Docker container. But during the establishment of the connection, the server changes their port to another number, say 45670. (Not sure how, but I am guessing the packets that are sent back suddenly mention this port, and our client will continue the rest of the exchange with this port number instead).
But now as I send packets (e.g. HTTP requests) to the host on port 45670, how will the Nginx docker container see those packets?
I am struggling to understand how server processes can run on Docker with only one port exposed / published for mapping.
Thanks!
","
But also: port 80 is just the listening socket, right? The listening socket only accepts the connection; after this any communication done between a client and the Nginx server is supposedly done on a different socket with a random port number (on the server side).

Nope. When a connection is established, the client side is a random port number (usually) and the server side is the same port that the server listens on.
In TCP there aren't actually listening sockets - they're an operating system thing - and a connection is identified by the combination of both the port numbers and both the IP addresses. The client sends a SYN (&quot;new connection please&quot;) from its port 49621 (for example) to port 80 on the server; the server sends a SYN/ACK (&quot;okay&quot;) from its port 80 to port 49621 on the client.
","  Ah, I see the problem you're facing! When using Docker, server programs like Nginx typically listen on a specific port on the host machine, such as port 80, and forward incoming connections to the container. However, as you've correctly observed, the listening port is not the same as the socket where the communication actually takes place.
To explain how this works in Docker, let's break down the communication process into two steps:
1. Accepting the connection: When a client connects to the host machine's port 80 (in this case), the Nginx container's `accept()` function is called. This function creates a new socket and binds it to the listening port (in this case, port 80). The socket is then ready to accept incoming connections.
2. Communicating with the client: Once a connection is established, the Nginx container creates a new socket to communicate with the client. This new socket is not the same as the listening port (port 80), but rather a random, unmapped port within the container. The communication between the Nginx container and the client is done on this new socket, and the listening port (port 80) is no longer involved in the communication process.
So, to answer your question, when a client connects to the host machine's port 80, the Nginx container creates a new socket to communicate with the client, and the communication takes place on this new socket. The listening port (port 80) is not involved in this communication process, only the new socket created by the Nginx container is used.
Now, you might be wondering how the Nginx container knows which port to use for communication. The answer is that the Nginx container uses a process called ""port mapping"" to map the client's request to a random port within the container. This allows the Nginx container to communicate with multiple clients on different random ports without conflicting with the host machine's listening ports.
In summary, when only the listening port (port 80 in this case) is mapped to the Docker host, the Nginx container creates a new socket for each incoming connection, and the communication takes place on these new sockets. The listening port is not directly involved in the communication process, and only serves as a placeholder for incoming connections.",0.7195079326629639,"docker, sockets, nginx",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Try:

","  Thank you for providing more details about the problem you're facing. To fix the date formatting issue in your SQL Server query, you can use the `Format` function to convert the dates to the desired format.
Here is an example of how you can modify your query to format the dates:

SELECT TOP 4 * FROM A AS T WHERE 1 = 1 AND ISNUMERIC(T.Id) = 1

Format(T.Date, 'digit2/digit2/digit4') AS FormattedDate

FROM 

A AS T 
WHERE 

1 = 1 AND ISNUMERIC(T.Id) = 1

```
In this modified query, I've added two new columns to the SELECT statement: `FormattedId` and `FormattedDate`. These columns contain the formatted date and Id values, respectively.
The `Format` function is used to convert the `Id` and `Date` values to the desired format. The format string `'digit2/digit2/digit4'` is used to split the date into three parts: year, month, and day.
Note that the `Format` function can be used with other date and time functions in SQL Server, such as `Date` and `Time`.

","  To flatten an object with a nested structure while maintaining the original type structure, you can use TypeScript's built-in ` flat` type alias. Here's an example of how to modify your code to achieve this:
First, create a new type that flattens the `body` property of the inner objects:
```typescript
type FlattenedBody = {
  [P in keyof NonNullable<typeof TestInterface['body']>]: P;
}
```
Next, modify the `TestInterface` type to include the `FlattenedBody` type as an additional property:

```typescript
type TestInterface {
  id: string
  body: FlattenedBody
  title: string
  something: string
  user: {
    id: string
    firstname: string
    lastname: string
    age: number
  }
  country: {
    id: string
    code: string
    name: string
    region: {
      id: string
      code: string
      name: string
      continent: {
        id: string
        code: string
        name: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
By using the `FlattenedBody` type, TypeScript will automatically flatten any nested objects in the `body` property, while still maintaining the original type structure of the `TestInterface` type.
Here's a breakdown of how the `FlattenedBody` type works:
* `P in keyof NonNullable<typeof TestInterface['body']>`: This is a type alias that flattens the `body` property of the inner objects. `keyof` is used to specify that the type should be a subset of the keys of the `body` property of the `TestInterface` type. `NonNullable<typeof TestInterface['body']>` is used to ensure that the type is non-nullable, since the `body` property of the inner objects may be nullable.
* `{ [P in keyof NonNullable<typeof TestInterface['body']>]: P; }`: This is a type that returns an object with a property for each key in the `keyof` type alias. Each property is of type `P`, which is the type of the corresponding key in the `keyof` type.
By using the `FlattenedBody` type, you can flatten the nested objects in the `body` property without losing the original type information of the `TestInterface` type.
Note that this approach will only work if the `body` property of the inner objects is always a non-nullable object with a finite number of properties. If the `body` property can be null or have an arbitrary number of properties, you may need to modify the `FlattenedBody` type accordingly.",0.6191113591194153,"typescript, typescript-typings, typescript-generics, flatten, infinite-recursion",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

Plot

","  To reduce the number of ticks on the colorbar and make them equispaced, you can use the `ticks` parameter of the `colorbar` function and set it to a vector of evenly spaced values between the minimum and maximum values of the colorbar.
In your case, you can set `ticks=np.arange(Amin, Amax+len(color.colors), len(color.colors))`, which will give you evenly spaced ticks between `Amin` and `Amax`, with `len(color.colors)` ticks in total.
Alternatively, you can use the `tick_��` function from the `matplotlib.colors` module to get an array of evenly spaced tick positions:
```python
ticks = color.ticks(len(color.colors))
aPe.colorbar(cm.ScalarMappable(cmap=color, norm=norm), ticks=ticks)
```
It's worth noting that the `ticks` parameter can also be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the tick label and the position of the tick on the colorbar. This can be useful if you want to have different tick labels for different parts of the colorbar.
In your case, you might want to use a combination of the two approaches, i.e., use `ticks=np.arange(Amin, Amax+len(color.colors), len(color.colors))` to get the evenly spaced ticks, and then use `tick_��` to get a list of tuples for the tick labels.
Finally, you can adjust the `zorder` parameter of the `patches` objects to control the ordering of the colorbar and the patches. A higher `zorder` value will make the colorbar and patches appear on top of the plot.",0.6737006902694702,"python, matplotlib",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I'm trying to find the location of the setting or preference within the Creator 8.0.1 IDE that allows me to see different properties of a selected object's colors instead of the one's presented by default.
Instead of this:


I'm hoping for this:

Also, and likely related, when I click the &quot;Color&quot; in the current setup, the Color Select Dialog that appears looks like this:

Is it possible, and I think it may fix itself if the properties color options issue above is solved, to have the default selector be this one?

If I double-click on an object within the design window, I get that selector, but if I click on the color within the properties panel, then I get the previous one.
I'm happy to provide any other info you may need:

Qt Creator 8.0.1

QML imports:

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Window 2.15
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

","The ColorEditor you're showing is the Qt Design Studio custom ColorEditor for the PropertyEditor. This was a change made in QtDS 2.2 release.
The first image is showing the integrated minimal color editor in the PropertyEditor, the second one is showing the old (pre QtDS 2.2) ColorEditor that needed a complete section. The decision was made that it needed a slimmer version of the ColorEditor and the full ColorEditor on demand. The third image is showing the new full ColorEditor of QtDS.
You can get the operation system ColorDialog in the new version of the QtDS ColorEditor by right-clicking on the ColorPicker in the full ColorEditor and choosing &quot;Open Color Dialog&quot; from the context menu.

","  No worries, I'm here to help! You've successfully explained your issue, and I understand your desire to change the default color picker in Qt Creator. Here's how you can achieve this:
1. Changing the default color picker in the Properties panel:
To change the default color picker in the Properties panel, you need to modify the `colorPropertyEditor` property in the `Property Window` settings. Here's how you can do it:
a. Open the `Properties` window of your project by clicking the `F4` key or by selecting `Window` -> `Properties`.
b. In the `Properties` window, click the `...` button next to the `color` property.
c. In the `Color Property Editor` settings, find the `colorPropertyEditor` property and change its value to `QColorDialog`. Here's an example:
d. Click `Apply` and close the `Properties` window.
Now, when you click the `Color` button in the Properties panel, you should see the `QColorDialog` instead of the default color picker.
1. Changing the default color picker for all objects:
If you want to change the default color picker for all objects in your project, you can modify the `QObject::colorPropertyEditor` property. Here's how you can do it:
a. Open the `QmlDesigner.qml` file in the `Qt Creator` using the `Ctrl + Shift + F7` keyboard shortcut.
b. In the `QmlDesigner.qml` file, locate the following code:
```qml
// Set the color picker for all objects
QObject {
id: qt
color: QColor(0, 0, 0) // Default color
colorPropertyEditor {
id: colorPropertyEditor
type: QColorDialog
}
```
c. Replace the `QColor(0, 0, 0)` value with `QColorDialog`. Here's an example:

d. Save the `QmlDesigner.qml` file and restart the `Qt Creator`.
After making these changes, all objects in your project should use the `QColorDialog` as the default color picker instead of the default one.
I hope this helps you get started with configuring the color picker in Qt Creator according to your preferences! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.",0.6317978501319885,"qt, ide, preferences",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

To fix this error, you can either remove the `*` symbol from the `SELECT` statement in the `UPDATE` clause, or you can modify the `RETURNS` clause in the function declaration to specify the actual column names that you want to return.
Here's an example of how you can modify the function to return only the `rec`, `template_name`, and `company_name` columns:

    RETURN;

This way, the function will return only the `rec`, `template_name`, and `company_name` columns from the `tempTable` table, and the `UPDATE` statement will be able to select only those columns.
Alternatively, you can remove the `RETURNS TABLE` clause from the function declaration, and instead use the `RETURN QUERY` clause to return the result set as a table. Here's an example of how you can modify the function to do that:

Program description
Hi, I've got a computationally heavy function which I want to run in parallel. The function is a test that accepts as inputs:

a DataFrame to test on
parameters based on which the calculations will be ran.

The return value is a short list of calculation results.
I want to run the same function in a for loop with different parameters and the same input DataFrame, basically run a brute-force to find optimal parameters for my problem.
The code I've written
I currently am running the code concurrently with ProcessPoolExecutor from the module concurrent.futures.
import concurrent.futures
from itertools import repeat
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]
large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for future in executor.map(func, repeat(large_df.copy()), parameters):
        test_result = future.result()
        ...

The problem
The problem I face is that I need to run a large amount of iterations, but my program crashes almost instantly.
In on order for it not to crash, I need to limit it to max 4 workers, which is 1/4 of my CPU resources.
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    ...

I figured out my program crashes due to a full RAM (16 GB). What I found weird is that when I was running it on more workers, it was gradually eating more and more RAM, which it never released, until it crashed.
Instead of passing a copy of the DataFrame, I tried to pass the file path, but apart of slowing down my program, it didn't change anything.
Do you have any idea of why that problem occurs and how to solve it?
","See my comment on what map actually returns.
This answer is relevant according to how large your parameters list is, i.e. how many total tasks are being placed on the multiprocessing pool's task queue:
You are currently creating and passing a copy of your dataframe (with large_df.copy()) every time you are submitting a new task (one task for each element of parameters. One thing you can do is to initialize your pool processes once with a single copy per pool process that will be used by every task submitted and executed by the pool process.  The assumption is that the dataframe itself is not modified by my_tests.func. If it is modified and you need a copy of the original large_df for each new task, the function worker (see below) can make the copy. In this case you would need 2 * N copies (instead of just N copies) to exist simultaneously where N is the number of processes in the pool. This will save you memory if the length of parameters is greater than that since in your code a copy of the dataframe will exist either on the task queue or in a pool process's address space.
If you are running under a platform such as Linux that uses the fork method to create new processes, then each child process will inherit a copy automatcally as a global variable:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]

large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited

def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):
        ...

my_tests.func is expecting as its first argument a dataframe, but with the above change the dataframe is no longer being passed; the dataframe is now accessed as a global variable. So without modifying func, we need am adapter function, worker, that will pass to func what it is expecting. Of course, if you are able to modify func, then you can do without the adapter.
If you were running on a platform such as Windows that uses the spawn method to create new processes, then:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func

def init_pool_processes(df):
    global large_df
    large_df = df


def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    parameters = [
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        ...
    ]
    
    large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited
    
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(initializer=init_pool_processes, initargs=(large_df,)) as executor:
        for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):
            ...

","  Ah, thanks for sharing the details of your problem! It's not uncommon for concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor to crash with full RAM, especially when processing large datasets. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:
1. **Lack of memory management**: When you're running multiple tasks in parallel, it's important to ensure that each task doesn't consume too much memory. If your tasks are generating large intermediate results, it can lead to memory exhaustion. To address this, you can use the `max_workers` parameter to limit the number of workers, as you've already tried. Alternatively, you can use the `apply` method instead of `map` to process the data in small chunks, which can help release memory used by the previous chunk.
1. **Incorrect data sharing**: When you pass the same DataFrame to multiple tasks, it can lead to unnecessary memory usage. Instead of passing the entire DataFrame, you can create a new DataFrame for each task and use the ` pandas.concat` method to concatenate the results. This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.
1. **Incorrect task sizing**: If your tasks are too large, it can cause the ProcessPoolExecutor to run out of memory. To fix this, you can use the `apply_async` method instead of `map` to process tasks in parallel. This method will give you the opportunity to specify a function to run in parallel, and you can use the `python.utils.synchronization.Semaphore` class to limit the number of tasks running concurrently.
1. **Insufficient RAM**: If your system has insufficient RAM, the ProcessPoolExecutor may crash or run slowly. In this case, you can try increasing the amount of RAM available to your Python process, either by adding more RAM to your system or by using a 3rd-party memory manager tool.
To solve the problem, you can try the following approaches:
* Limit the number of workers by using `max_workers` parameter: `with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:`
* Use `apply` method instead of `map` to process data in small chunks: `with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor: executor.apply(func, iterate(large_df.copy()), parameters)`
* Create a new DataFrame for each task and use `pandas.concat` method to concatenate results: `with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor: executor.apply_async(func, repeat(large_df.copy()), parameters).result()`
* Use `apply_async` method instead of `map` to process tasks in parallel: `with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor: executor.apply_async(func, iterate(large_df.copy()), parameters)`
* Increase the amount of RAM available to your Python process: You can use a tool like `htop` or `top` to monitor your system's memory usage and see if it's running low. If you have spare RAM available, you can try increasing the amount of RAM available to your Python process.

Here is the code I am using:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  geom_bar(aes(x=AgeFactor,fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=FdgFactor,fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width=.6)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(&quot;0-6months&quot;,&quot;7-12months&quot;,&quot;1-1.99&quot;,&quot;2-2.99&quot;,&quot;3-3.99&quot;,&quot;4-4.99&quot;,&quot;5-5.99&quot;,&quot;6-6.99&quot;,&quot;7-7.99&quot;,&quot;8-8.99&quot;,&quot;9-9.99&quot;,&quot;10-10.99&quot;))+
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)

and this is the graph it is creating for me:

I really appreciate any insight. This is my first time asking a question on stack too - so I am happy to edit/adjust info as needed.
","The issue is that you plot from different columns of your dataset. To dodge your bars position_dodge requires a column to group the data by. To this end you could reshape your data to long format using e.g. tidyr::pivot_longer so that your two columns are stacked on top of each other and you get a new column containing the column or group names as categories.
Using some fake random example data. First I replicate your issue with this data and your code:
set.seed(123)

levels &lt;- c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)

Graph &lt;- data.frame(
  AgeFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  FdgFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  lab = 1:100
)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(NULL, aes(lab), position_dodge(.5)) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = .6) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)) +
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)


And now the fix using reshaping. Additionally I simplified your code a bit:

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

Graph_long &lt;- Graph %&gt;%
  select(AgeFactor, FdgFactor) %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(c(AgeFactor, FdgFactor))
  
ggplot(Graph_long, aes(x = value, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(&quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;, &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = levels) +
  labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = &quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))


","  No worries, and welcome to Stack Overflow! 😊 It's not uncommon for beginners to have trouble with ggplot2, especially when dealing with complex datasets and visualizations. You're on the right track by separating the data into two charts and then combining them into a single chart. Here's how you can fix the overlaying issue:
1. Use `facet_grid()` to separate the charts: Instead of using `geom_bar()` twice, you can use `facet_grid()` to separate the data into separate charts for each variable. This will automatically give you separate panels for each chart. Here's an updated version of your code:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + 
ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  facet_grid(AgeFactor~FdgFactor, scales = &quot;free&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=., fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=., fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6)
2. Adjust the x-axes: Since you're now using `facet_grid()`, you need to adjust the x-axes for each chart. You can do this by adding `scale_x_continuous()` to each `geom_bar()` call. Here's an updated version of your code:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + 
ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  facet_grid(AgeFactor~FdgFactor, scales = &quot;free&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, scale = &quot;free&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, scale = &quot;free&quot;)
3. Add space between the charts: By default, `facet_grid()` will stack the charts on top of each other. To add space between them, you can use `space` argument in `facet_grid()`. Here's an updated version of your code:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + 
ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  facet_grid(AgeFactor~FdgFactor, scales = &quot;free&quot;, space = &quot;free&quot;) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, scale = &quot;free&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, scale = &quot;free&quot;)
By applying these changes, you should get a clean and well-spaced chart that shows the distribution of age of diagnosis and feeding challenges for each group.

","As per this git issue, Adding billing.admin role to the Terraform Service Account solves your issue.
And check this issue if the issue still continues after adding the role.
","  Thank you for providing the details of the issue you're facing. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the error is happening because your service account is not authorized to use the billingbudgets.googleapis.com API.
To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:
1. Add the necessary permissions to your service account:
To use the billingbudgets API, your service account needs to have the following permissions:
`billingbudgets.googleapis.com`
* `billingbudgets.create`
* `billingbudgets.get`
* `billingbudgets.list`
* `billingbudgets.update`
You can add these permissions to your service account by following these steps:
a. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the IAM & Admin > Service accounts > [your service account name].
b. Click on the ""Edit"" button and then click on the ""Add members"" button.
c. In the ""Add member"" section, enter the following role names:
`billingbudgets.googleapis.com`
d. Click on the ""Add"" button to add the role to the service account.
2. Set the `billing/quota_project` setting in your Terraform configuration:
You can set the `billing/quota_project` setting in your Terraform configuration to the project that you want to use for billing and quota purposes.
Here's an example of how you can set this setting in your Terraform configuration:
resource ""google_billing_budget"" ""budget"" {
  billing_account = var.billing_account
  display_name = var.name
  budget_filter {
    projects = [var.projects]
  }
  amount {
    specified_amount {
      currency_code = ""USD""
      units = var.budget_amount
    }
  }
  threshold_rules {
    threshold_percent = var.budget_threshold
  }
}
In this example, the `billing/quota_project` setting is set to the project that you want to use for billing and quota purposes.
3. Update your Terraform configuration:
After making the necessary changes to your Terraform configuration, you can update your Terraform configuration by running the following command:
terraform init
terraform apply
This will update your Terraform configuration with the new settings and try to create the billing budget again.
That's it! With these steps, you should be able to create a billing budget for your project using Terraform. If you have any further issues, please let me know.",0.5336853265762329,"google-cloud-platform, terraform-provider-gcp",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73185851,GNU memmem vs C strstr,"Is there any use case that can be solved by memmem but not by strstr?
I was thinking of able to parse a string raw bytes (needle) inside a bigger string of raw bytes(haystack). Like trying to find a particular raw byte pattern inside a blob of raw bytes read from C's read function.
","There is the case you mention: raw binary data.
This is because raw binary data may contain zeroes, which are interpreted and string terminator by strstr, making it ignore the rest of the haystack or needle.
Additionally, if the raw binary data contains no zero bytes, and you don't have a valid (inside the same array or buffer allocation) extra zero after the binary data, then strstr will happily go beyond the data and cause Undefined Behavior via buffer overflow.

Or, to the point: strstr can't be used if the data is not strings. memmem doesn't have this limitation.
","  Yes, you are correct. memmem() is a function in the GNU memories library that allows you to search for a pattern in a large block of memory, similar to strstr() in C. While strstr() performs a linear search through the haystack, memmem() uses a more efficient algorithm that is optimized for searching for a pattern in a large block of memory.
Memmem() uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is a more efficient algorithm for searching for a pattern in a large block of data compared to the linear search used by strstr(). The Boyer-Moore algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the haystack, making it much faster than strstr() for large haystacks.
So, in the scenario you described, where you need to search for a particular raw byte pattern inside a blob of raw bytes read from C's read function, memmem() would be a better choice than strstr() because it can handle large haystacks more efficiently.
However, it's worth noting that memmmem() is not always the best choice for every scenario. For example, if you are searching for a pattern that is not a power of 2 in size, then strstr() may be faster due to its simpler implementation.
In summary, when searching for a pattern in a large block of memory, memmmem() is generally the better choice due to its faster and more efficient algorithm. But, in cases where the pattern is a power of 2 in size or simpler, strstr() may be a better choice due to its simpler implementation and faster lookup time for smaller haystacks.",0.6926845908164978,c,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Per @jasonharper's comment above, CTkButton is

not actually a Tkinter Button at all (it's made from a Frame containing a Canvas and a Label), so the normal Tkinter attribute-getting functions don't apply.

Instead of using self.ecdpower[&quot;text&quot;] or self.ecdpower.cget(&quot;text&quot;): I should use

self.ecdpower.text

to get the CTKbutton's text value.
The same can be applied with fg_color; use self.ecdpower.fg_color to get the value.
","  The issue you're encountering is that the `cget` method in Tkinter is not able to access the `text` attribute of a button widget because it's not a valid option for the button. The `cget` method is designed to retrieve the value of a widget's configuration option, which is typically a string or integer value.
To retrieve the text value of a button widget, you can use the `config` method instead of `cget`. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to retrieve the text value of the button:
```python
    def startstream(self):

        try:

            while True:

                    self.conn, self.addr = self.server.accept()
                    
                    self.clients.append(self.conn) #stores all client connections

        except:

            pass 


    def startChat(self): #function to accept client connections


        self.server.listen(30)


        try:

            while True:

                    self.conn, self.addr = self.server.accept()

                    self.clients.append(self.conn) #stores all client connections

        except:

            pass


    def startstream(self):


        try:

            if not self.clients: #checks if list is empty

                messagebox.showerror(&quot;No Connections!&quot;, &quot;No clients connected to host!&quot;)

            else:

                for x in self.clients:

                    self.ecdpower.config(text = self.ecdpower.get(text)) #retrieve the text value of the button

                    if self.ecdpower.text == &quot;Off&quot;; #ecdpower button widget acts like a &quot;power button&quot;

                        self.ecdpower.configure(text = &quot;On&quot;, fg_color = &quot;Green&quot;)

                        x.send((&quot;On&quot;).encode(self.FORMAT))

                    else:
                         self.ecdpower.configure(text = &quot;Off&quot;, fg_color = &quot;Red&quot;)

                        x.send((&quot;Off&quot;).encode(self.FORMAT))

        except:

            print (traceback.format_exc())    

```

In this modified code, we use the `config` method instead of `cget` to retrieve the text value of the button widget. We call the `config` method with the `text` option, which returns the current value of the button's text attribute.
Note that you can also use the `binding` option to bind the `text` attribute to a variable, like this:

```python

    def startstream(self):


        try:


            while True:


                    self.conn, self.addr = self.server.accept()


                    self.clients.append(self.conn) #stores all client connections


        except:

            pass 



    def startChat(self): #function to accept client connections



        self.server.listen(30)



        try:


            while True:


                    self.conn, self.addr = self.server.accept()


                    self.clients.append(self.conn) #stores all client connections


        except:

            pass


    def startstream(self):



        try:


            if not self.clients: #checks if list is empty


                messagebox.showerror(&quot;No Connections!&quot;, &quot;No clients connected to host!&quot;)


            else:


                for x in self.clients:


                    self.ecdpower_text = self.ecdpower.text


                    if self.ecdpower_text == &quot;Off&quot;; #ecdpower button widget acts like a &quot;power button&quot;


                        self.ecdpower.configure(text = &quot;On&quot;, fg_color = &quot;Green&quot;)


                        x.send((&quot;On&quot;).encode(self.FORMAT))


                    else:
                         self.ecdpower.configure(text = &quot;Off&quot;, fg_color = &quot;Red&quot;)


                        x.send((&quot;Off&quot;).encode(self.FORMAT))


        except:


            print (traceback.format_exc())    


```

In this modified code, we use the `binding` option to bind the `text` attribute of the button widget to a variable called `self.ecdpower_text`. We can then use this variable to retrieve the current text value of the button in the `startstream` function.
Note that this approach has the advantage of allowing you to reuse the `text` option in other parts of your code, without having to hardcode the text value of the button.",0.6843370199203491,"python, customtkinter",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

In JMeter, you can extract the Sample Start value from the Sampler result tab using a simple Script Extractor. Here's how to do it:
1. Open the JMeter Properties file (.prop file) and add the following lines to the ""Scripts"" section:
a. Add the following line:
```
Script= (${__ Sampler_Result }.SampleStart)
```
This script extracts the value of the ""SampleStart"" property of the current Sampler result.
b. Add another line:

```
 var= ${__ScriptResult}
```
This line defines a variable named ""var"" that will store the extracted value.
1. Save the changes to the Properties file and restart JMeter.
2. Open the Test Plan where you want to extract the Sample Start value.
3. Add a Sampler to the Test Plan, right-click on it and select ""Edit Config"".
4. In the Sampler Config, go to the ""Result"" section and select the ""Sample Start"" property.
5. Drag and drop the ""Script Extractor"" component above the Sampler in the Test Plan.
6. Connect the ""Script Extractor"" to the ""Sample Start"" property of the Sampler.
7. Double-click on the ""Script Extractor"" component to open its config.
8. In the Script Extractor config, select ""JavaScript"" as the Script Language and paste the script you defined in step 1:
```
 Script= (${__ Sampler_Result }.SampleStart)
```
9. Save the changes to the Script Extractor config.
10. Run the Test Plan and wait for the Sampler to complete.
11. The extracted Sample Start value will be displayed in the ""var"" variable in the Script Extractor config.
You can now use the extracted value in any other part of your Test Plan or JMeter scripts.
Note that theScript Extractor does not work for other Sampler properties, but only for the ""SampleStart"" property.",0.6927763223648071,"jmeter, jmeter-plugins, jmeter-5.0",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74472565,Which data type to use for different configurations,"I have a 4 different configurations to be used and these configuration values are stored in a property file. The properties for all the configurations are same, but the values are different for each.
Ex:
The property file configurations I am using:
####Config1####
conf1.password=admin
conf1.username=admin
conf1.context=123
conf1.name=localhost

####config2####
conf2.username=app
conf2.password=app
conf2.context=com
conf2.name=localhost

####config3####
conf3.username=app
conf3.password=app
conf3.context=com
conf3.name=localhost

####config4####
conf4.username=app
conf4.password=app
conf4.context=com
conf4.name=localhost


I can get the properties from the property file. Is it possible to have a single variable to store these values based on configuration and access them in an optimised and readable way?
I tried using hash-map for every configuration separately and fetching it from that. But it is increasing my code redundancy as if I perform same steps for every configuration and if-elsed the configuration name to get the hashmap values.
Currently I am using the properties with hashmap like this:
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf1 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf2 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf3 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf4 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

conf1.put(&quot;UserName&quot;, prop.getProperty(“conf1.username&quot;));
conf1.put(&quot;Password&quot;,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf1.password&quot;));
conf1.put(“name”,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf1.name&quot;));
conf1.put(&quot;context”,”conf1,context”);

conf2.put(&quot;UserName&quot;, prop.getProperty(“conf2.username&quot;));
conf2.put(&quot;Password&quot;,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf2.password&quot;));
conf2.put(“name”,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf2.name&quot;));
conf2.put(&quot;context”,”conf2,context”);

conf3...
conf4...

if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(“conf1”)) {
    GenerateTestFile(
          &quot;Name:“ + conf1.get(&quot;Name&quot;) + “-UserName:” +
          conf1.get(&quot;UserName&quot;) + “-Password:” + conf1.get(&quot;Password&quot;) + 
        &quot;-Context:” + conf1.get(“Context”) ,FileName);
} else if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(“conf2”)) {
GenerateTestFile(
          &quot;Name:“ + conf2.get(&quot;Name&quot;) + “-UserName:” +
          conf2.get(&quot;UserName&quot;) + “-Password:” + conf2.get(&quot;Password&quot;) + 
        &quot;-Context:” + conf2.get(“Context”) ,FileName);
}
Else if(conf3){…}
Else if(conf4){…}


","You could use a Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; where the key is the name of the configuration, and the value (Map&lt;String,String&gt;) is the configuration parameters.
To load the file, you would do something like this:
private static Pattern RE = Pattern.compile(
        &quot;([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)\\.([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)&quot;);

private static Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; loadConfs(String name)
        throws IOException {
    Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; confs = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    Properties props = new Properties();
    ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    try (InputStream in = cl.getResourceAsStream(name)) {
        props.load(in);
    }
    for (String propName: props.stringPropertyNames()) {
        Matcher matcher = RE.matcher(propName);
        if (matcher.matches()) {
            String confName = matcher.group(1);
            String parmName = matcher.group(2);
            Map&lt;String,String&gt; conf = confs.get(confName);
            if (conf == null) {
                conf = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
                confs.put(confName, conf);
            }
            conf.put(parmName, props.getProperty(propName));
        }
    }
    return confs;
}

You could then do something like this:
Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; confs = loadConfs(&quot;conf.properties&quot;);
...
Map&lt;String,String&gt; conf = confs.get(confName);
if (conf != null) {
    GenerateTestFile(
            &quot;Name:“ + conf.get(&quot;Name&quot;)
            + “-UserName:” + conf.get(&quot;UserName&quot;)
            + “-Password:” + conf.get(&quot;Password&quot;)
            + &quot;-Context:” + conf.get(“Context”),
            FileName);
}

","  It seems like you are facing an issue with managing multiple configurations in your software system, and you want a single variable to store these values in an optimized and readable way. Here are some suggestions to help you solve this problem:
1. Use an Object-Oriented Approach:
Instead of using a map for each configuration, consider creating an object for each configuration and store the configuration values as fields in those objects. This will make it easier to manage and access the configuration values.
For example, you could create a class called `Configuration` with fields for `username`, `password`, `name`, and `context`. Then, you could create an instance of this class for each configuration and access the fields as needed.
2. Use a Configuration Class:
You could create a `Configuration` class that has getters and setters for each configuration value. Then, you could create an instance of this class for each configuration and access the values as needed.
Here's an example of how you could define a `Configuration` class:
```
public class Configuration {
    private String username;
    private String password;
    private String name;
    private String context;

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;

    }

    public String getPassword() {

        return password;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {

        this.password = password;

    }

    public String getName() {

        return name;

    }

    public void setName(String name) {

        this.name = name;

    }

    public String getContext() {

        return context;

    }

    public void setContext(String context) {

        this.context = context;

    }

}
```
3. Use a YAML or JSON Configuration File:

You could use a YAML or JSON configuration file to store the configuration values. This will make it easier to manage and access the configuration values. You could create a separate file for each configuration and load the values into the code as needed.
4. Use a Centralized Configuration File:
You could use a centralized configuration file that stores all the configuration values for all the configurations. This will make it easier to manage and access the configuration values.
For example, you could create a `config.properties` file that stores the configuration values for all the configurations, like this:
```
conf1.password=admin
conf1.username=admin
conf1.name=localhost

conf2.username=app
conf2.password=app

conf3.username=app

conf4.username=app

```
Then, you could load the values from the configuration file using the `Properties` class and access them as needed.
5. Use a Third-Party Configuration Management Tool:
If you have a lot of configuration files and find it difficult to manage them, you could consider using a third-party configuration management tool like Apache Commons Configuration or Netflix's Hystrix. These tools provide a simple and consistent way to manage configuration values across multiple applications and environments.
In summary, the best approach depends on your specific use case and requirements. You could consider using an Object-Oriented approach, a Configuration class, a YAML or JSON configuration file, a centralized configuration file, or a third-party configuration management tool.",0.6874552369117737,"java, properties-file",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74575521,Rename Azure Storage Table Column,"As the title says, is it possible to rename an Azure Storage Table column?
I tried using the portal and through storage explorer with no results
","Hmm.. Haven't had to do this before. But if I had to make a guess, it's that columns don't really exist in table storage. There is no schema anyway, you can include whatever fields in the objects. To rename a column, you'd probably have to go through all the objects and rename the field in them.
","  Yes, it is possible to rename an Azure Storage Table column. You can use the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer to rename a column in an Azure Storage Table. Here are the steps to follow:
Using Azure Portal:

1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Storage account where your Azure Storage Table is located.
2. Click on the Table name to open its details page.
3. Click on the ""Settings"" tab.
4. Under the ""Table settings"" section, click on ""Update"".
5. In the ""Update table settings"" blade, scroll down to the ""Columns"" section and click on the ""Edit"" icon next to the column you want to rename.
6. Enter the new name for the column in the ""Name"" field.
7. Click ""Save"" to apply the changes.

Using Azure Storage Explorer:

1. Open Azure Storage Explorer and connect to your Storage account.
2. Navigate to the Table you want to rename.
3. Right-click on the Table name and select ""Rename"".
4. In the ""Rename Table"" dialog box, enter the new name for the Table.
5. Click ""OK"" to apply the changes.

Both methods should work, but using the Azure portal is generally simpler and more user-friendly. Once you've renamed the column, any existing data in the column will be renumbered according to the new name. Note that renaming a column will also affect any stored procedures, UDFs, or other code that references the column by its old name.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or encounter any issues.",0.6963874101638794,"azure, azure-table-storage",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73102008,How to convert a dictionary with a tuple inside of a nested list?,"I'm trying to create a bigram from a dictionary with a specific condition. Below is the example of the dictionary:
dict_example = {'keywords1': ['africa',
  'basic service',
  'class',
  'develop country',
  'disadvantage',
  'economic resource',
  'social protection system']

The specific condition is that I want to create a bigram if the words in each element are more than 1. Below is the code that I have been working on so far:
keywords_bigram_temp = {}
keywords_bigram = {}
for k, v in dict_example.items():
    keywords_bigram_temp.update({k: [word_tokenize(w) for w in v]})
    for k2, v2 in keywords_bigram_temp.items():
        keywords_bigram.update({k2: [list(nltk.bigrams(v3)) for v3 in v2 if len(v3) &gt; 1]})

This code works, but instead of returning a normal tuple within a list (I think this is what bigram normally looked like), it returns a tuple within a nested list. Below is an example of the result:
'keywords1': [[('basic', 'service')],
  [('develop', 'country')],
  [('economic', 'resource')],
  [('social', 'protection'),
   ('social', 'system'),
   ('protection', 'system'),
   ('social', 'protection')]}

What I need is a normal bigram structure, a tuple within a list like so:
'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'),
  ('develop', 'country'),
  ('economic', 'resource'),
  ('social', 'protection'),
  ('protection', 'system')]}

","Here's a way to do what your question asks using itertools.combinations():
from itertools import combinations
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2)]}

Output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('social', 'system'), ('protection', 'system')]}

Explanation:

in the dict comprehension, use for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem to iterate over all items in the list associated with keywords1 that contain a ' ' character, meaning the words in the element number more than 1
use the nested loop for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2) to include every unique combination of 2 words within the multi-word item

UPDATE:
Based on OP's clarification that original question contained an extra entry,  and that what is required is &quot;in a 'a b c d' context, it will become ('a','b'),('b','c'),('c','d')&quot;, here are three alternative solutions.
Solution #1 using walrus operator := and dict comprehension:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if len(words := elem.split()) &gt; 1 for x in zip(words, words[1:])]}

Solution #2 using a long-hand for loop:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        keywords_bigram['keywords1'].extend(zip(words, words[1:]))

Solution #3 without zip():
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            keywords_bigram['keywords1'].append(tuple(words[i:i+2]))

All three solutions give identical output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('protection', 'system')]}

","  The issue you're facing is that `nltk.bigrams` function returns a generator that yields each bigram in the input text, but in your case, you're trying to iterate over the lists of bigram sequences inside the nested list. To fix this, you can modify your code as follows:
keywords_bigram_temp = {}
keywords_bigram = {}
for k, v in dict_example.items():
    keywords_bigram_temp.update({k: [word_tokenize(w) for w in v]})
    for k2, v2 in keywords_bigram_temp.items():
        # Iterate over the list of bigram sequences for each key
        bigram_list = []
        for v3 in v2:
            # Iterate over each bigram in the list
            for bigram in v3:
                # Add each bigram to the list
                bigram_list.append(brigr(bigram))
        keywords_bigram.update({k2: bigram_list})

Here's how the modified code works:
1. We iterate over the `v2` list for each key `k2` as before.
2. Inside the loop, we use a nested loop to iterate over each bigram in the list `v3`.
3. For each bigram, we use the `brigr` function to create a new bigram.
4. We add each new bigram to a list called `bigram_list`.
5. Finally, we update the `keywords_bigram` dictionary with the `bigram_list` for each key `k2`.
By modifying the code in this way, you should be able to get the desired output: a dictionary with a bigram for each key, where each bigram is a tuple within a list.",0.6703969240188599,"python, nltk",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  To dynamically convert a PySpark DataFrame columns to a map, you can use the `andas` module in PySpark. Specifically, you can use the `DataFrame.to_dict()` method to convert the DataFrame to a dictionary.
Here's an example of how to do this:
```
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from pyspark.sql.DataFrame import DataFrame
import pandas as pd

# create a sample DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame([('key_column', ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3']),
('key_column', ['Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6']),
('key_column', ['Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9'])], ""key_column String, values: String"")
# convert the DataFrame to a dictionary
# this will create a dictionary for each row in the DataFrame
# the keys of the dictionary are the values in the 'key_column' column,
# and the values are a list of the values in the 'values' column
Dict_df = df.to_dict()

print(Dict_df)
```
 Output:

 {'key_column': {'Value_1': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3'], 'Value_4': ['Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6'], 'Value_7': ['Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}, 'key_column': {'Value_1': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3'], 'Value_4': ['Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6'], 'Value_7': ['Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}}

 # you can also use the to_dict() method with the columns option to specify which columns to convert to a dictionary

 # for example, to convert only the 'values' column, you can use the following code

Dict_df = df.to_dict(columns=['values'])

print(Dict_df)
```
 Output:

 {'key_column': {'Value_1': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3'], 'Value_4': ['Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6'], 'Value_7': ['Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}, 'values': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3', 'Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6', 'Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}

 # you can also use the to_dict() method with the orient option to specify the orientation of the dictionary,

 # for example, to convert the DataFrame to a dictionary with the 'key_column' as the keys and the 'values' as the values, you can use the following code

Dict_df = df.to_dict(columns=['key_column', 'values'], orient='index')

print(Dict_df)
```
 Output:

 {'key_column': {'Value_1': 'Value_1', 'Value_2': 'Value_2', 'Value_3': 'Value_3'}, 'values': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3', 'Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6', 'Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}

```
You can also use the `to_dict()` method with the `structured` option to convert the DataFrame to a dictionary with a more structured format.


Dict_df = df.to_dict(columns=['key_column', 'values'], structured=True)

print(Dict_df)
```
 Output:

 {'key_column': {'value_1': 'Value_1', 'value_2': 'Value_2', 'value_3': 'Value_3'}, 'values': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3', 'Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6', 'Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}

```
Note that the `to_dict()` method returns a dictionary, so you can access the values in the dictionary using the keys.

    Map_df = convert_df_to_map(df, columns_to_map=['key_column', 'values'])

 # print the resulting dictionary

    print(Map_df)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```



 Output:



 {'key_column': {'Value_1': {'Value_1': 'Value_1', 'Value_2': 'Value_2', 'Value_3': 'Value_3'}, 'Value_4': {'Value_4': 'Value_4', 'Value_5': 'Value_5', 'Value_6': 'Value_6'}, 'Value_7': {'Value_7': 'Value_7', 'Value_8': 'Value_8', 'Value_9': 'Value_9'}}, 'values': ['Value_1', 'Value_2', 'Value_3', 'Value_4', 'Value_5', 'Value_6', 'Value_7', 'Value_8', 'Value_9']}



```


Note that in the `convert_df_to_map()` function, we first use the `_process_df()` function to process the DataFrame and return a dictionary with the specified columns. Then, we use the `to_dict()` method to convert the dictionary to a map data structure.

","  Great! You're on the right track with using `grep` to search for lines in a log file that match a pattern. To search for lines between two specific times, you can use the `-m` option with `grep`.
The `-m` option tells `grep` to search for lines that match the pattern at least once between the specified times. Here's how you can use it to search for lines between 13:27:45 and 13:28:00:
`grep -m 45 logfile`
`45` in this command represents the time interval between 13:27:45 and 13:28:00. The `-m` option is optional, but it makes the command more readable and easier to understand.
So, the command you want to use to search for lines between 13:27:45 and 13:28:00 is:
`grep -m 45 logfilename`
As you mentioned, you can also use `sed` or `awk` to perform this search. Here's an example using `awk`:
`awk 'BEGIN{ print $0 >= ""13:27:45"" && print $0 <= ""13:28:00""}' logfile`
In this command, the `BEGIN` block is used to define a starting point and an ending point for the search. The `>` operator is used to compare the timestamp of each line with the desired time range. If a line's timestamp is greater than or equal to 13:27:45 and less than or equal to 13:28:00, it will be printed to the output.
So, the output of this command will contain all the lines from the log file that match the desired time range.
Note that `sed` can also be used for this task, but `awk` is generally easier to use for this type of search due to its built-in timestamp manipulation capabilities.",0.6161779165267944,"linux, unix, grep",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Thank you for providing the details of your problem. You can use the `groups` method in PySpark to group the rows in the `eligible` DataFrame based on the `name` column, and then filter out the rows that do not meet the condition you specified. Here's an example code snippet that should work for your problem:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
# group the rows in the eligible DataFrame by the name column
grouped_eligible = eligible.groupBy(col(""name""))
# filter out the rows that do not meet the condition
filtered_eligible = grouped_eligible.filter(
# join the resulting DataFrames with the customer_id column
joined_df = filtered_eligible.join(customer_df, on=""name"")
# print the resulting DataFrames
joined_df.show()
```
In this code, `eligible` is the DataFrame that contains the rows you want to filter, `customer_df` is the DataFrame that contains the customer ID column, and `joined_df` is the resulting DataFrame that contains the filtered rows from `eligible` joined with the `customer_df`.
Here's an explanation of the code:
1. The `groups` method in PySpark is used to group the rows in the `eligible` DataFrame based on the `name` column. The resulting `groups` object is a `PythonRDD` of grouped rows, with each group containing the rows that have the same value in the `name` column.
2. The `filtered_eligible` variable is created by filtering out the rows from the `groups` object that do not meet the condition specified in the code. In this case, only the rows where the `segment_list` and `rung_list` values exist in the `eligible` DataFrame are included in the filtered result.
3. The resulting `filtered_eligible` DataFrame is then joined with the `customer_df` using the `join` method. The join is performed based on the `name` column in both DataFrames.
4. Finally, the resulting `joined_df` is printed using the `show` method.
Note that you can modify the code to suit your specific requirements. For example, if you want to return only the `name` column from the resulting DataFrame, you can use the `select` method instead of `show`.",0.5914530158042908,"apache-spark, pyspark, apache-spark-sql",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74350679,"Python mixins : how to deal with *args, **kwargs when calling super()?","In the following example I show some mixins that may or may not use *args or **kwargs:

Here I encounter an issue because the last mixin is calling its parent which doesn't exist:
Cell In [4], line 9, in BMixin.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
      8 def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

     11     self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))

TypeError: object.__init__() takes exactly one argument 
           (the instance to initialize)

How should I modify this example to allow any combination of mixins, and inherit mixins in any order?
One possible UGLY solution is to add a dummy end mixin:
class EndMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        ...
        
class AMixin(EndMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;AMixin&quot;)
        self.a = 'a' + str(kwargs.get('a', ''))
        
class BMixin(EndMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;BMixin&quot;)        
        self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))
               

","You can make your mixins inherit from a base-class that stops the super call to object.
class BaseMixin:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass


class AMixin(BaseMixin):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        print(&quot;AMixin&quot;)
        self.a = 'a' + str(kwargs.get('a', ''))


class BMixin(BaseMixin):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        print(&quot;BMixin&quot;)
        self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))


class ABMixin(AMixin, BMixin):
    ...

    ...


class B(BMixin):
    ...


class AB(ABMixin):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)


obj = AB(a='a', b='b')
print(obj.b)
print(obj.a)

","  The issue you are facing is caused by the fact that `super()` doesn't know which mixin to call when you call it with a mixture of mixins. In your example, `BMixin` calls `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` which will try to call the `__init__` method of the parent mixin, but `AMixin` doesn't have a `__init__` method, so you get a `TypeError`.
To fix this issue, you can use a combination of two techniques:
1. Using keyword-only arguments: Instead of passing positional arguments to `super().__init__`, you can pass keyword-only arguments that will be forwarded to the parent mixin. For example, you can define a `super_init` method that takes a dictionary of keyword arguments and calls `super().__init__` with those arguments.
2. Using a magic method: You can define a magic method `wrap` in your mixins that will wrap the `__init__` method of the parent mixin with the `kwargs` passed to the mixin. Here's an example:
class MagicMixin:
    def wrap(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
In your example, you can modify the `__init__` method of each mixin to call `wrap` instead of `super().__init__`:
class AMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;AMixin&quot;)
        self.a = 'a' + str(kwargs.get('a', ''))
    def wrap(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

class BMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(& quot;BMixin&quot;)        
        self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))
    def wrap(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

class ABMixin(AMixin, BMixin):

    def wrap(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

class A(AMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().wrap(**kwargs)

class B(BMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().wrap(**kwargs)

class AB(ABMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):

        super().wrap(**kwargs)

In this example, when you call `super().__init__` in the `__init__` method of a mixin, it will be wrapped with the `wrap` method, which will forward the `kwargs` to the parent mixin. This way, you can use any combination of mixins and inherit mixins in any order without any issues.
It's worth noting that the `wrap` method is a bit more complex than the other approaches, as it needs to handle the case where the parent mixin doesn't have an `__init__` method. In that case, it will raise a `NotImplementedError`.",0.842707633972168,"python, oop, traits, mixins",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you fix the problem you're encountering in your Django REST framework API.
To output the child data in the same parent, you can use the `api_view` function in `urls.py` to specify the view for the endpoint. In this case, you can use the `TestingAPI` view from `views.py` and pass the `company_id` parameter to filter the child tasks for a specific parent.
Here's an example of how you can modify `urls.py` to achieve this:
 urls.py:
```python
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import TestingAPI

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register('tasks', TestingAPI, basename='testing')

path('testing/<int:company_id>/', TestingAPI.as_view(), name='testing_api')
```
In this example, the `TestingAPI` view is registered with the `DefaultRouter` and the `testing` basename, which means that all endpoints for the `TestingAPI` view will be prefixed with `testing/`.
Next, in the `TestingAPI` view, you can use the `company_id` parameter to filter the child tasks for a specific parent:
 views.py:
```python
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet
from .models import TestingTasks

class TestingSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializers):

    class Meta:

        model = TestingTasks

        fields = ['Taskname', 'dateofuse', 'Compressing', 'Path']

    def get_queryset(self):

        return TestingTasks.objects.filter(parent_id=self.request.query_params.get('company_id'))


class TestingAPI(APIView):

    def get(self, request, company_id):

        serializer = TestingSerializer(TestingTasks.objects.filter(parent_id=company_id))

        return Response(serializer.data)

```
In this example, the `TestingSerializer` uses the `get_queryset` method to filter the child tasks for a specific parent by using the `parent_id` field in the queryset. The `get` view then serializes the filtered tasks and returns them in the response.
You can also add the `put` and `delete` views for updating and deleting the child tasks, respectively. Here's an example of how you can modify the `views.py` file to add those views:
 views.py:

class TestingAPI(APIView):

    def put(self, request, company_id):

        serializer = TestingSerializer(TestingTasks.objects.filter(parent_id=company_id), data=request.data)

        if serializer.is_valid():

            serializer.save()


        return Response(serializer.data)


class TestingAPI(APIView):


    def delete(self, request, company_id):

        serializer = TestingSerializer(TestingTasks.objects.filter(parent_id=company_id))


        if serializer.is_valid():

            serializer.delete()


        return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)


```

&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;John&quot; &gt;

But when I add ngModel, the value is no longer initialized, and nothing is showed in the text box.
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ngModel name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;John&quot; &gt;

How can I put a value in text box with ngModel ?
","MyComponent.component.html
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;

MyComponent.component.ts
...
class MyComponent {
  public name = &quot;Jhon&quot;;
}

And as you update the input, the variable name will be updated. If you dont want it updated just use [ngModel] instead of [(ngModel)]
","  Ah, I see the issue! When using `ngModel`, Angular will automatically detect changes to the `value` property of the input element and update the bound model value. However, when you first load the page, the `value` property of the input element will be initialized to an empty string, rather than the value you specified in the `ngModel` directive.
To fix this, you can use the `ngModelCtrl` object to set the initial value of the input field. Here's an example:
```
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ngModel name=&quot;name&quot; [ngModelController]=""myCtrl"" value=&quot;John&quot; &gt;









myCtrl = {
  $setViewValue: function(newValue) {
    this.name = newValue;
  };
};

```

In this example, we've added an optional `ngModelController` property to the `input` element, and set it to a separate component (`myCtrl`) that implements the `NgModelController` interface. We've also added a `value` property to the `myCtrl` object, which will be used to initialize the input field with the specified value.
When the component is initialized, Angular will create an instance of the `NgModelController` class and bind it to the input field. The `NgModelController` class will then watch the `value` property of the input field, and update the bound model value whenever the input field changes.
So in this example, when the page loads, the input field will be initialized with the value ""John"", and subsequent changes to the input field will be reflected in the model value.
Note that you can also use the `ngModel` directive without an `ngModelController` property, and Angular will still automatically detect changes to the `value` property of the input field. However, using an `ngModelController` can provide additional functionality, such as setting the initial value of the input field.",0.7024554014205933,angular,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73690166,Can you generate a scene graph after a plant has been finalized?,"I'm working on a project that requires me to add a model through Parser (which requires the plant to be of the same type as the array used) before Setting the position of the model in said plant and taking distance queries. These queries only work when the query object generated from the scene graph is of type float.
I've run into a problem where setting the position doesn't work due to the array being used being of type AutoDiff. A possible solution would then be converting the plant of type float to Autodiff with plant.ToAutoDiff(), but this only creates a copy of the plant without coupling it to the scene graph (and in turn the query object) from which the queries are derived. Taking queries with a query object generated from the original plant would then fail to reflect the new position passed to the AutoDiff copy.
Is there a way to create a new scene graph from the already finalized symbolic copy of the original plant, so that I can perform the queries with it?
","A couple of thoughts:

Don't just convert the plant to autodiff. Convert the whole diagram. That will give you a converted, connected network.
You're stuck with the current workflow. Presumably, your proximity geometries are specified in your parsed file (as &lt;collision&gt; tags). The parsing process is ephemeral. The declaration is consumed, passed through MultibodyPlant into SceneGraph. If there is no SceneGraph at parse time, all knowledge of the declared collision geometry is forgotten.

So, the typical workflow is:

Create a float-valued diagram.
Scalar convert it to an AutoDiff-valued diagram.
Keep both around to serve the different roles.

We don't have a tutorial that directly shows scalar converting an entire diagram, but it's akin to what is shown in this MultibodyPlant-specific tutorial. Just call ToScalarType() on the Diagram root.
","  Yes, you can create a new scene graph from the already finalized symbolic copy of the original plant by using the `SceneGraph.AddChild` method. Here's an example of how you can do this:
1. First, get a reference to the symbolic copy of the original plant using `plant.ToSymbolicCopy()`:
```
var symbolicPlant = plant.ToSymbolicCopy();
```
2. Create a new scene graph using `SceneGraph.Create` and pass the symbolic plant as an argument:
```
var newSceneGraph = SceneGraph.Create(symbolicPlant);
```
3. Add the model to the new scene graph using `SceneGraph.AddChild`:
```
var model = ...; // Your model object
var node = newSceneGraph.AddChild(model);
```
4. Set the position of the model in the new scene graph:

var sceneGraphNode = newSceneGraph.GetNodeByName(""YourModel"");
var position = ...; // The new position of the model
sceneGraphNode.SetPosition(position);
```
5. Perform distance queries with the new scene graph:

var distance = sceneGraph.QueryDistanceToSceneGraph(queryObject);

```
By creating a new scene graph from the symbolic copy of the original plant, you can update the position of the model in the new scene graph and perform distance queries with the updated position. Note that the original plant will not be affected by this process, and it will continue to be used for other purposes (such as handling other queries or updates).

","Adding 'search' before the source should resolve it.
either 'search' or '|' should be the first command while creating search query via rest api.
","  The issue you're encountering is due to a problem with the way you're escaping the search string in the `eval` function. The `eval` function in Splunk uses double quotes to enclose the search string, but in your case, you're using single quotes, which are not supported.
To fix this issue, you can modify your search string to use double quotes, like this:
String mySearch = ""source='/u/applic/wsadmin/WMSE/apache/logs/httpd_60402/access_log' | eval server_type=mvindex(split('host', '.'),0), site=mvindex(split('host', '.'),1), country=mvindex(split('host', '.'),2), domain=mvindex(split('host', '.'),3), org=mvindex(split('host', '.'),4) | search country='us' serviceName='/services/*' | chart count by serviceName"";
Alternatively, you can use single quotes instead of double quotes, but you need to escape the single quotes like this:
String mySearch = ""source='/u/applic/wsadmin/WMSE/apache/logs/httpd_60402/access_log' | evalserver_type=mvindex(split('host', '.'),0),site=mvindex(split('host', '.'),1),country=mvindex(split('host', '.'),2),domain=mvindex(split('host', '.'),3),org=mvindex(split('host', '.'),4) | search country='us' serviceName='/services/*' | chart count by serviceName"";

    val it: (('_a -&gt; '_b) -&gt; '_a -&gt; '_b)    
Either make the arguments to 'it' explicit or, if you do not intend for it to be generic, add a type annotation.

Can someone explain what's going on with this error in the F# type system?
To me,
val it: (('_a -&gt; '_b) -&gt; '_a -&gt; '_b) should be actually the expected result, and how can I sort this out? Thanks.
","My previous answer explains what Value Restriction is and why it happens. But now your next question is: ok, so what do I do about it?
As the error message itself suggests, there are two possible ways: (1) give it explicit arguments or (2) if you don't want it to be generic, add a type annotation.
1. Explicit arguments
let flippedPipe x = flip (|&gt;) x

Even though logically this is the same as let flippedPipe = flip (|&gt;), syntactically this is now a function, not a value. And syntax is what matters for the Value Restriction.
2. A type annotation
let flippedPipe : (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int -&gt; int = flip (|&gt;)

This works because the function is no longer generic, so the Value Restriction does not apply. This is a desirable option in many circumstances, but judging by the kinds of functions you're working with here, I would assume this is not what you wanted in this case.
3. Explicit type parameters
The error message doesn't mention this, and in fairness, it can be considered a variation of option (2). The idea is that you can give your function explicit type parameters like this:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; = flip (|&gt;)

This makes the Value Restriction go away, because, even though it still technically applies, the fact that you added the type parameters presumably shows that you know what you're doing, so the compiler shuts up.
However, though this appears to work at first glance, it does so in the wrong way. If you look at the inferred type of this function, you'll see:
val flippedPipe : (obj -&gt; obj) -&gt; obj  -&gt; obj

This happens because, even though you added type parameters, you didn't specify exactly where they go. They may not be used at all (aka &quot;phantom types&quot;) for all the compiler knows.
So to make it work properly, this should be the definition:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = flip (|&gt;)

","  The error message you're seeing is related to the type inference system in F#. When you define a function `flip` that takes a function `f` and applies it to an argument `a`, the type system infers the type of `it` to be `(a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c`, which means it expects `it` to be a function that takes a function `f`, a value `b`, and a value `a`, and returns a value of type `c`.
The issue here is that the type of `it` is too flexible, and the type system cannot determine the intended type of `it` based on the given parameters. This is why it's asking you to make the arguments to `it` explicit or add a type annotation.
In F#, when you use the pipe operator `|>` to apply a function to multiple arguments, the type system infers the type of the resulting function based on the types of the arguments passed to the pipe operator. In this case, the type of the resulting function is `(a -> b -> c)`, which is why the type of `it` is inferred to be the same as the function `flip`.
To fix this error, you have two options:
1. Explicitly specify the type of `it` to make it clear that it's not a generic function. You can do this by adding a type annotation after the definition of `flip`, like this:
val flip = fun f -> fun a -> fun b -> f(b)(a);; type of it = 'a -> 'b -> 'c
This tells the type system that `it` has type `a -> b -> c`, which is the expected result.
2. Change the definition of `flip` to use the pipe operator in a way that the type system can infer the correct type of `it`. You can do this by defining `flip` like this:
val flip = |> fun f -> fun a -> fun b -> f(b)(a);;
This definition uses the pipe operator to apply the function `f` to the arguments `a` and `b`, and the type of `it` is inferred to be `a -> b -> c`, which is the expected result.
In summary, the error message you're seeing is related to the type inference system in F# and the way it infers the type of `it` based on the given parameters. By explicitly specifying the type of `it` or changing the definition of `flip` to use the pipe operator in a way that the type system can infer the correct type, you can resolve this error and use the `flip` function as expected.",0.7455120086669922,"haskell, functional-programming, f#, type-systems",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","It is not possible, function names convention allows spaces in test methods but not multiple lines : https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#names-for-test-methods

In tests (and only in tests), you can use method names with spaces enclosed in backticks.

A method with multiple lines in its name would not be callable even through reflection. (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/45750788/7346454)
","  Yes, you can indeed use backticks to span a function name across multiple lines in Kotlin. This is called a ""multiline function name"" in Kotlin.
To do this, you can enclose the function name in backticks (``) and continue the string on the next line. Here is an example of how you can modify your code to use a multiline function name:
@Test
fun `This is a really long description of what should happen to this function when the IDs do not match up.`() {
  // test
}

In this example, the function name `This is a really long description of what should happen to this function when the IDs do not match up.` is spanned across two lines using backticks.
Note that you can also use backticks to define a multiline string literal in Kotlin. This can be useful when you need to define a long string that spans multiple lines. For example:
@Test
fun `This is a really long string that spans multiple lines.`() {
  ""This is the first line of the string"" +
    ""This is the second line of the string""

I believe it is related to javascript, but I am not sure how to do it.
My bookings/search looks like this:
bookings/search
","Just changed the method to &quot;get&quot; instead of &quot;post&quot; and it works.
","  It sounds like you have a good understanding of the HTML and JavaScript basics, but you're facing some challenges in implementing the search functionality. Here's a solution that should work for your case:
1. JavaScript Function to Generate the Search Link:
First, you'll need to create a JavaScript function that takes the selected search criteria and generates the search query URL. Here's an example function:
```javascript
function generateSearchQuery() {
  // Get the selected search criteria from the form elements
  const email = document.getElementById(""inputEmail3"").value;
  const numTickets = document.getElementById(""inputPassword3"").value;
  // Create the search query URL
  const searchQuery = `/bookings/search?`;
  if (email !== """") {
    searchQuery += ""email="" + encodeURIComponent(email) + ""&"";
  }
  if (numTickets !== """") {
    searchQuery += ""numTickets="" + numTickets + ""&"";
  }
  // Remove the extra ""&"" at the end
  searchQuery = searchQuery.slice(0, searchQuery.length - 1);
  return searchQuery;
}
```
In this function, we're using the `document.getElementById()` method to get the values of the form elements. We're then creating the search query URL by concatenating the parameters using the ""&"" operator. Finally, we're removing the extra ""&"" at the end of the URL.
2. Adding the Search Link to the Form:
Next, you'll need to add the generated search query URL to the form's ""action"" attribute. Here's an example:
```html

<form action=""{{ generateSearchQuery() }} method=""POST"">
```
By calling the `generateSearchQuery()` function inside the form's ""action"" attribute, we're telling the browser to submit the form to the URL generated by the function.
3. Handling the form submission:
Finally, you'll need to handle the form submission in your server-side code. Here's an example of how you could do that:
```javascript

// Handle the form submission
$app.post('/bookings/search', (req, res) => {
  // Get the search criteria from the request parameters
  const email = req.param('email');
  const numTickets = req.param('numTickets');

  // Search the database using the selected criteria
  // ...

  // Return the search results

  res.send(results);

});
```
In this example, we're using the Express.js framework to handle the form submission. We're accessing the request parameters using the `req.param()` method and then searching the database using the selected search criteria. Finally, we're returning the search results to the client.
That's it! With these changes, the form should now submit the search criteria to the server-side code, which will perform the search and return the results to the client.",0.21627146005630493,"javascript, html, node.js, express",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

But If I used &lt;Input&gt; &lt;/Input&gt; instead, these problems are gone.
code sample is here
","This works as intended. Did you forget to actually set state?

","  Thank you for providing more information about the issue you're experiencing with the Semantic UI Search component. Based on what you've shared, it seems like the problem might be related to the way React is handling the event for the search field.
In your code, you're passing the `onChange` event to the `search` component, but you're not handling the event itself. Instead, you're console.logging the value of the search field after each character is entered.
To fix the issue, you can modify your code to handle the `onChange` event in the `search` component, like this:
```
import React from 'react';
function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState('');
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value);
    // console.log(query);
    // your code here

  };

  return (
    <div>
      <SemanticUISearch onChange={handleChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this modified code, we're adding an `onChange` event handler to the `search` component, which sets the `query` state variable to the value of the search field. We're also console.logging the value of the search field after each character is entered.
Note that we're not using the `onChange` event for anything else in this example, but you can add other code to handle the event as needed.
By handling the `onChange` event in the `search` component, we're ensuring that the search field is only updating the state variable once per character entered, rather than clearing the input field and only showing the first character as you mentioned.

","Use StringBuilder instead of string for result. This will reduce time to few secs.

","  Ah, I see. You're trying to concatenate millions of array elements into a single string, but the operation is taking too long due to the size of the array. There are a few approaches you could take to improve performance in this scenario:
1. **Use a more efficient data structure:** Instead of using an array to store the values, consider using a more efficient data structure such as a Vector or a List. These data structures allow you to add and remove elements efficiently, which can help reduce the memory usage and improve performance.
2. **Use parallel processing:** If you have a multi-core processor, you can take advantage of parallel processing to speed up the concatenation operation. You can use frameworks like Java Parallel Execution (JPE) or the Java Stream API to parallelize the iteration over the array.
3. **Use a more efficient concatenation method:** The `+` operator in Java is not very efficient for concatenating large strings. Instead, consider using the `CharsSequence` class provided by the Java API, which allows you to concatenate strings more efficiently.
4. **Use a caching mechanism:** If you're concatenating the same values multiple times, consider using a caching mechanism to store the previously concatenated values. This can help reduce the number of concatenation operations and improve performance.
5. **Optimize the code for the specific use case:** Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may be able to optimize the code further. For example, if you know that the array elements are mostly the same, you can use a hash function to pre-compute the concatenated string and store it in a cache.
Without further information about your specific use case and requirements, it's difficult to provide a more specific answer. However, I hope these suggestions help you improve the performance of your code.",0.6505131721496582,"java, arrays, for-loop",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73398477,How to use the next_rails gem for dual booting on heroku,"I am using the next_rails gem for dual booting and am ready to test on heroku, which I normally do by git push staging master. How do I test the next rails version on heroku?
","In theory you should be able to set the BUNDLE_GEMFILE Heroku environment variable to Gemfile.next, and then just push it to staging e.g.
heroku config:set  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.next -r staging

git push staging master

Unfortunately there appears to be an issue with the Heroku ruby buildpack. My work around is as follows
a) use the next_rails gem as documented for development server and development tests
b) Once ready for testing deployment, create a new branch, with the only change is for the Gemfile to go from:
...
if next?
  gem 'rails', '~&gt; 7.0.3.1'
  gem &quot;sprockets-rails&quot;
else
  gem 'rails', '~&gt; 6.1.6.1'
end

to:
...
 gem 'rails', '~&gt; 7.0.3.1'

And deploy that branch to staging. This branch only needs to be merged with master when you want to test out staging.
If the issue is resolved, I will update this answer.
","  Great, I'd be happy to help you with that!
To use the `next_rails` gem for dual booting on Heroku, you can follow these steps:
1. First, make sure that you have the `next_rails` gem installed in your Rubymine project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
gem install next-rails
```
2. Next, you need to create a new `heroku.yml` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the configuration forHeroku. Here's an example of what the file might look like:
```
production:
  url: https://my-app-production.herokuapp.com/
  env:
    RAILS_ENV: production
    NEXT_RAILS_DUAL_BOOT: true
    NEXT_RAILS_DUAL_BOOT_ORDER: [""primary"", ""secondary""]
development:
  url: https://my-app-dev.herokuapp.com/
  env:
    RAILS_ENV: development
    NEXT_RAILS_DUAL_BOOT: true
    NEXT_RAILS_DUAL_BOOT_ORDER: [""primary"", ""secondary""]
```
In this example, we're defining two environments: `production` and `development`. The `production` environment is the environment that will be used when the app is deployed to Heroku, and the `development` environment is the environment that will be used when you're developing the app locally.
3. Next, you can use the `git push` command to push your code to your Heroku remote repository. Here's an example of how you might do this:
```
git push staging master
```
When you run this command, Heroku will automatically detect that you've updated your `heroku.yml` file and will use the configuration in that file to deploy your app.
4. Finally, you can use the `next_rails` gem to dual boot your app on Heroku. Here's an example of how you might do this:
```
next rails init
```
This command will initialize the `next_rails` gem and create a new `config/next_rails.yml` file for you. You can then use this file to configure your app for dual booting on Heroku.
5. To test your app on Heroku, you can run the following command:
```
git push heroku
```
This command will push your code to your Heroku remote repository and deploy it to your app. You can then access your app by going to the `https://my-app-production.herokuapp.com/` URL.
 That's it! With these steps, you should be able to use the `next_rails` gem for dual booting on Heroku. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",0.722167432308197,"ruby-on-rails, heroku, next-rails",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

simplify=False and truncate_by_edge=True did the trick.

","  Ah, I see! You're facing an issue with retrieving OSM roads using `osmnx` because the extreme end nodes of the roads are beyond a certain distance (100 meters) from the point you're querying. To solve this problem, you can use the `distance_threshold` parameter in the `graph_from_point` function to set a minimum distance threshold for the nodes to be considered in the graph.
Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:
```python
G = osmnx.graph_from_point((lat, lng), custom_filter=road_filter, distance_threshold=1000)
```
By setting the `distance_threshold` to a value larger than the distance between the point and the farthest end node, you can ensure that the graph includes all the roads that are within the specified distance from the point, regardless of their extreme end nodes.
In your case, you can set the `distance_threshold` to `1000`, which means that any node that is within a distance of 1000 meters from the point will be included in the graph.
Note that you may want to experiment with different values for `distance_threshold` to find the sweet spot that balances the amount of relevant data with the computational efficiency of the query.",0.6015280485153198,"networkx, openstreetmap, osmnx",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  To convert a `List<String>` of language names to a `List<LanguageDatum>` of model objects, you can use the `Map` class in Flutter to map the string values to the corresponding properties of the `LanguageDatum` class. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```dart
List<LanguageDatum> selectedLanguagesList = [];
// Initialize the list of language names
langList = ['English', 'Gujarati', 'Hindi', 'Marathi', 'Punjabi', 'Urdu', 'Spanish'];
// Create a Map to convert the language names to LanguageDatum objects
Map<String, LanguageDatum> languageMap = langList.map((language) {
    return LanguageDatum(
        id: language.split('_').first,
        name: language,
        status: 1,
        createdAt: DateTime.now(),
        updatedAt: DateTime.now(),
        deletedAt: null,
    );

return languageMap[language];

});
```
In this example, the `languageList` is a `List<String>` of language names, and the `languageMap` is a `Map<String, LanguageDatum>` that maps the language names to `LanguageDatum` objects. The `map` function is used to create the `LanguageDatum` objects for each language name in the `langList`, and the `Map` object is used to store the created objects.
You can then use the `select` method to retrieve the `LanguageDatum` objects from the `languageMap` based on the language names in the `langList`.
```dart
List<LanguageDatum> selectedLanguages = languageMap.select((language) {
    return language.name == 'English';

});
```
In this example, the `select` method is used to retrieve the `LanguageDatum` objects from the `languageMap` that have the `name` property equal to `'English'`. The resulting `selectedLanguages` list will contain only the `LanguageDatum` objects for the English language.
You can also use the `where` method to filter the `LanguageDatum` objects based on a condition.
```dart
List<LanguageDatum> selectedLanguages = languageMap.where((language) {
    return language.name == 'English';

});
```
In this example, the `where` method is used to filter the `LanguageDatum` objects in the `languageMap` that have the `name` property equal to `'English'`. The resulting `selectedLanguages` list will contain only the `LanguageDatum` objects for the English language.

","You can use groupby with something like:
for quarter, df in ad.groupby('quarter'):
    df.to_csv(f&quot;C\\Data\\{quarter}\\Sensor_1minData_{quarter}.csv&quot;)

","  Yes, there are several ways to improve your code, including:
1. **Using datetime index**: Instead of using `ad.index = pd.to_datetime(ad.index, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')`, you can use the datetime index directly in the DataFrame creation using `pd.DataFrame({'sensor_value': [10, 20]}, index=pd.date_range('2019-01-01', freq='H'))`. This way, you don't need to convert the index to a datetime format later on.
2. **Using quarterly frequency directly**: Instead of creating a new column `quarter` and then filtering the DataFrame based on that column, you can use the `quarterly` frequency directly in the DataFrame creation using `pd.DataFrame({'sensor_value': [10, 20]}, index=pd.date_range('2019-01-01', freq='Q')).resample('Q').mean()`. This way, you don't need to create a separate column for the quarterly frequency.
3. **Using pathlib to create folders**: Instead of using `fold_location = 'C:\\Data\\'`, you can use `pathlib.Path()` to create the folders. For example, `pathlib.Path('C:\\Data').mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)`. This way, you don't need to worry about the folder structure or encoding issues.
Here's the updated code based on these improvements:
```python
import pandas as pd
# create DataFrame with sensor values
ad = pd.DataFrame({'sensor_value': [10, 20]}, index=pd.date_range('2019-01-01', freq='H'))
# extract quarterly data and export to quarterly folders
quarterly_freq = ad.resample('Q').mean()
# create quarterly folders
pathlib.Path('C:\\Data').mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
for quarter, value in quarterly_freq.items():
    save_loc = pathlib.Path('C:\\Data\\{}.csv'.format(quarter))
    value.to_csv(save_loc)
```
This code creates a DataFrame with the sensor values and then extracts the quarterly data using `resample('Q').mean()`. It then creates the quarterly folders using `pathlib.Path()` and exports the quarterly data to those folders using `to_csv()`.",0.594707727432251,"python, pandas, dataframe, numpy, datetime",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I'm getting my DDL successfully parsed but why I'm getting all this additional information displayed on the screen?
Is snowflake-connector and simple-ddl-parser somehow interfering with each other?

I have no idea... but I don't want to see this &quot;debug&quot; info on my screen but want to use simple-ddl-parser.
I will be happy to get any feedback! Thx!
","The DDLParser has default log level set to DEBUG as I can see here.
You can set the DDLParser logging to CRITICAL and these messages won't appear on the screen anymore.
So, in your existing script add:
import logging
...
result = DDLParser(ddl[0], log_level=logging.CRITICAL).run()

See more information here.
","  The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that the Snowflake Connector and the simple-ddl-parser are both using the same namespace for some of their functions and variables. This can cause conflicts and strange behavior when using both libraries together.
In particular, the Snowflake Connector uses the `connector` module, which defines several functions and variables with the same names as those used by the simple-ddl-parser. For example, `connector.execute()` and `simple_ddl_parser.parse()` both use the `execution` variable.
To resolve this issue, you can try either of the following:
1. Use a different namespace for the Snowflake Connector's functions and variables. For example, you could define a new module called `snowflake_connector` and move all the Snowflake Connector's functions and variables to that module. Then, you can import the `snowflake_connector` module in your Python script instead of the `connector` module.
2. Modify the simple-ddl-parser code to use a different namespace for its functions and variables. For example, you could define a new namespace `ddl_parser` and move all the simple-ddl-parser's functions and variables to that namespace. Then, you can import the `ddl_parser` namespace in your Python script instead of the `simple_ddl_parser` module.
By taking one of these approaches, you should be able to avoid the conflicts and strange behavior that you're experiencing when using both libraries together.
Another thing you can try is to update the Snowflake Connector to the latest version, as the latest version of the Snowflake Connector may have addressed some of the compatibility issues with the simple-ddl-parser.",0.4140165448188782,"python, snowflake-cloud-data-platform, ddl",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

The Gamma distribution is defined as:
$$ f(x \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac {'\beta Wilson(\alpha, \x)""} {'\beta'}xe^\left(-\frac{\betax^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\right)$$
where `x` is the random variable, `alpha` is the shape parameter, `beta` is the scale parameter, `Gamma` is the gamma function, and `Wilson` is the Wilson function.
The Wilson function is defined as:
$$ Wilson(\alpha, x) = \frac {'1}{{\Gamma(\alpha)}}\int _0^\infty t^{{\alpha}-1}e^{-t}dt$$
The correct values for the shape and scale parameters are `alpha = 0.5` and `beta = 50`, which correspond to a Gamma distribution with shape parameter `alpha = 0.5` and scale parameter `beta = 50`.
Here's how you can modify your code to use the correct values:
    using System;
    using MathNet.Numerics.Distributions;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            double sum = 0.0;
            var dist = new Gamma(0.5, 50);
            int runs = 1000000;
            for (int i = 0; i < runs; i++)
            {
                sum += dist.Sample();
            }
            Console.WriteLine((sum / runs).ToString());
        }
    }

With these corrected values, you should now get a mean of approximately 11.37, which matches the result obtained using an online calculator.
Note that the Gamma distribution has two shape parameters, `alpha` (the shape parameter) and `beta` (the scale parameter), which can be confusing when comparing to other distributions that have only one shape parameter. However, it's essential to use the correct values for these parameters to obtain accurate results.",0.604254961013794,"c#, mathnet-numerics",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

    |        ^

If I replace the arguments n and k with references, it compiles. Turns out, the functions in the PartialOrd are also implemented using references. So from my understanding, the expression 2 &lt; 4 will call the le function with references. For performance reasons, I doubt that's what's happening, though.
It's actually two questions that I'm asking:

Can I solve the error without using references?
Why is PartialOrd using references while Ord uses values (at least for min and max, but not for cmp)?

","
Adding #![feature(const_refs_to_cell)] makes it compile.
min and max take Self because they return one of the two arguments as Self. Other methods in Ord and PartialOrd else returns a bool or an Ordering so they can take by reference. if min and max they took by reference the signature would be fn max&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self, other: &amp;'a Self) -&gt; &amp;'a Self which you &quot;get for free&quot; because there is a impl&lt;A&gt; Ord for &amp;A where A: Ord.

","  Great, let's dive into this! 🔍

 question 1: Can I solve the error without using references?

Yes, you can solve the error without using references by using the `std::ops::PartialOrd` trait instead of the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait. `std::ops::PartialOrd` is a trait that provides the `PartialOrd` method for any type that supports the `PartialOrd` method, including reference types.
Here's an updated version of your `foo` function that uses `std::ops::PartialOrd`:

const fn foo&lt;T&gt;(n: T, k: T) -> T

where T: Sized + PartialOrd, {
    if n < k {
        n
    } else {
        k
    }
}

This should fix the issue of borrowing errors, as `std::ops::PartialOrd` does not require borrowing the type.


question 2: Why does PartialOrd use references while Ord uses values (at least for min and max, but not for cmp)?

The reason why `PartialOrd` uses references while `Ord` uses values has to do with the design of the `PartialOrd` trait.
The `PartialOrd` trait is designed to provide a way to compare two values for inequality, but it does not require the values to be equal. In other words, `PartialOrd` provides a way to compare two values for inequality, but it does not require the values to be non-ambiguous.
On the other hand, `Ord` is designed to provide a way to compare two values for equality, and it requires the values to be non-ambiguous. `Ord` provides a way to compare two values for equality, and it requires the values to be equal.
The reason why `PartialOrd` uses references while `Ord` uses values is because references are more appropriate for providing a way to compare two values for inequality. When comparing two values for inequality, it is more common to use references to the values being compared, as this allows the comparison to be made without any ambiguity.
In contrast, when comparing two values for equality, it is more common to use values themselves, as this allows the comparison to be made with more precision.
The `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait is a specialization of the `std::cmp::Ord` trait that provides the `PartialOrd` method for certain types, including reference types. This specialization is necessary because the `Ord` trait requires the types to be non-ambiguous, which is not always the case for reference types.
In summary, the reason why `PartialOrd` uses references while `Ord` uses values has to do with the design of the `PartialOrd` trait and the requirements of the `Ord` trait. References are more appropriate for providing a way to compare two values for inequality, while values themselves are more appropriate for providing a way to compare two values for equality.",0.5825902819633484,rust,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  The error you're experiencing is due to the fact that you're trying to assign a variable with the value of a widget (in this case, the `TextField` widget) directly to a variable. In Flutter, widgets are not constants, so you can't assign them directly to variables.
The solution is to use the `binding` function provided by the `InputDecoration` widget to get the text value from the `TextField` widget. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

  }
}
```
In this updated version of the code, I've replaced the `onChanged` callback with the `onChanged` function provided by the `InputDecoration` widget. This function takes the text value as an argument and assigns it to the `_formKey.currentState.insertInputText` method, which is a safe way to set the value of a `TextEditingController` widget.
Note that I've also removed the `const` keyword from the `Column` widget, as you mentioned, since it's not necessary in this case.",0.3605978488922119,"flutter, dart",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","This is a mongoose feature, not to be confused with javascript or MongoDB.
pymongo does not offer such capabilities.

","  Yes, I can help you with that! In PyMongo, you can enable timestamps on a MongoDB collection by using the `timestamp` field in the schema. Here's an example of how to do this:
1. First, import the `pymongo` module:
```
import pymongo
```
2. Next, connect to your MongoDB instance using the `pymongo` module:

client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
```
3. Create a new schema for your collection that includes the `timestamp` field:

your_collection = client['your_database']['your_collection']
your_schema = {'name': ..., 'timestamp': {'createdAt': true, 'updatedAt': true}}
```
In the above example, `your_collection` is the name of the collection you want to add timestamps to, and `your_database` is the name of the database containing the collection. The `your_schema` variable defines the schema for the collection, including the `timestamp` field with the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields set to `true`.
4. Once you have the schema, you can use the `your_collection.insert_one()` method to insert a new document into the collection with timestamps automatically populated:

new_document = {'name': ..., 'timestamp': {'createdAt': Date.now(), 'updatedAt': Date.now()}}
your_collection.insert_one(new_document)

In the above example, `Date.now()` returns the current date and time in milliseconds, which is used to populate the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.

Alternatively, you can also use the `pymongo.collection. timestamps` property to enable timestamps on a collection:

your_collection.timestamps = True

This will enable timestamps on the collection, and documents will have the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields automatically populated when inserted or updated.

","  To extract the start and end of multiple ranges from a column, you can use a combination of MySQL's SQL functions, such as `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `ORDER BY`. Here's an example query that should give you the desired results:
```
SELECT DateTime, MotorStatus
FROM YourTableName 
WHERE MotorStatus LIKE 'Start%' -- this part of the query will filter out all rows where the MotorStatus is not ""Start""
BETWEEN '03-02-20' -- this part of the query will filter out all rows where the date and time are not between the specified date and time
ORDER BY DateTime -- this part of the query will sort the results by DateTime descending

```
Here's a breakdown of the query:
* `WHERE MotorStatus LIKE 'Start%'` - This will filter out all rows where the MotorStatus is not ""Start"" or ""Starts"".
* `BETWEEN '03-02-20'` - This will filter out all rows where the date and time are not between the specified date and time. You can replace '03-02-20' with the desired date and time range.
* `ORDER BY DateTime` - This will sort the results by DateTime descending. This means that the results will be sorted in reverse chronological order, with the most recent row first.
To get the start and end of each range, you can use the `SUBSTRING_INDEX` function to extract the start and end times of each range. For example:
```
SELECT
SUBSTRING_INDEX(DateTime, ' Start', 1) AS start, 
SUBSTRING_INDEX(DateTime, ' Stop', -1) AS end 
FROM YourTableName 
WHERE MotorStatus LIKE 'Start%' 
BETWEEN '03-02-20'

```
This query will extract the start and end times of each range, based on the `MotorStatus` column. The `SUBSTRING_INDEX` function is used to extract the start and end times of each range, and the `BETWEEN` function is used to filter out all rows where the date and time are not within the specified range.
You can then use the `start` and `end` columns to get the start and end times of each range.

LocalDateTime[] onTimes
I would like to find an efficient way (without iteration) of finding the minimum LocalDateTime.
Is there a quick way to do this?
","You could, conceivably, use recursion; but I would not recommend that for performance. The best way I can think of is using the streams api like
LocalDateTime min = Arrays.stream(onTimes).min(Comparator.naturalOrder())
        .orElseThrow();

Note: This still iterates all elements internally to find the minimum.
For completeness sake; to do this without iteration, as I said, might be done recursively.

    return getMinimum(onTimes, 0);

private static LocalDateTime getMinimum(LocalDateTime[] onTimes, int i) {

","  Yes, there are several efficient ways to find the minimum `LocalDateTime` in an array in Java without iteration. Here are a few approaches:
1. Using the `Arrays.min()` method:
Java 8 onwards provides the `Arrays.min()` method that returns the minimum element of an array. You can use this method to get the minimum `LocalDateTime` in your array as follows:
```java
LocalDateTime minimum = Arrays.min(onTimes);
```
This method will return the minimum `LocalDateTime` in the `onTimes` array.
2. Using the` Stream.min()` method:
You can also use the `Stream.min()` method to find the minimum `LocalDateTime` in an array. Here's an example:
```java
LocalDateTime minimum = Stream.of(onTimes).min().orElseThrow();
```
This method will return the minimum `LocalDateTime` in the `onTimes` array.
3. Using the `MinMaxP` class from the `java.util.function` package:
If you are using Java 8 or later, you can also use the `MinMaxP` class from the `java.util.function` package to find the minimum `LocalDateTime` in an array. Here's an example:
```java
LocalDateTime minimum = MinMaxP.min(onTimes);
```
This method will return the minimum `LocalDateTime` in the `onTimes` array.
All of these methods should give you the minimum `LocalDateTime` in your array without having to iterate over the array.
Note that the `Arrays.min()` method and the `Stream.min()` method will return `Optional<LocalDateTime>` if there are no elements in the array, while the `MinMaxP.min()` method will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if there are no elements in the array.",0.7606091499328613,"java, arrays, minimum",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

const integerArray = [1,2,3,4,5]


const result = dateArray.reduce((acc, current) => {
      const row = acc.find((prevRow) => {
          return prevRow[0] === current;
      });

      if (!row) {

          acc.push({ [dateArray.indexOf(current)]: timeArray.find((time) => time === current) || [] });

      } else {

          row[dateArray.indexOf(current)] = timeArray.find((time) => time === current) || [];

      }

      return acc;



    }, {});

console.log(result);

```

In this solution, we're using the `reduce()` method to iterate over the `dateArray` and for each element, we're trying to find an existing `row` in the `acc` (aggregate) object based on the `date` value. If no existing `row` is found, we're creating a new `row` with the `time` value. If an existing `row` is found, we're simply adding the `time` value to the existing `row`.
Finally, we're returning the `acc` object as the final result.
The `Object.fromEntries()` method is used to convert the `acc` object to an object with key-value pairs, where the keys are the `date` values and the values are the arrays of `time` values.
Note that we're using the `indexOf()` method to get the index of the `date` value in the `dateArray`, so that we can use it as a key in the resulting object.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",0.8354099988937378,"javascript, reactjs, arrays, object, data-manipulation",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
73660116,Enabling SMTP Basic Authentication on Office365-Tenant after 1st Oct 2022,"I understand that SMTP Basic Authentication on Office365-Tenants will be automatically disabled from the 1st October 2022 on. As SMPT Oauth 2.0 Client Credential Flow has not been implement yet by Microsoft we can't move our product implementation (non-interactive) away from Basic Authentication.
We therefore need our customers to be able to keep SMTP Basic Authentication enabled after the 1st. October.
Question:

Will existing Office365-Tenants be able to keep SMTP with Basic Authentication enabled until Oauth 2.0 Client Credential Flow will be available for SMTP?
Is the same also true for new Tenants that are created in future? 

Thanks!
","SMTP basic auth is not going away yet 😉

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-and-exchange-online-september-2021-update/ba-p/2772210 (Bolded line after the first paragraph)
","  The changes are Microsoft introduced will disable SMTP Basic Authentication on all Office365 tenants starting from October 1st, 2022, according to the information you provided. As of now, there is no client credential flow implementation for SMTP in Microsoft, so your product implementation (non-interactive) cannot transfer from basic authentication.
Here's your response to your question:
1. Existing Office365 tenant: Yes, existing tenants can keep SMTP basic authentication enabled until OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow is available for SMTP. This implies that present clients can continue to use basic authentication for SMTP communication with Office365 until Microsoft offers a suitable alternative.
2. New tenants: No, new tenants produced in the future will no longer be supported for SMTP basic authentication by Microsoft after the deadline. Instead, they will need to switch to OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for SMTP communication.

Based on this information, if you and your clients need to keep using basic authentication for SMTP, you should do so before October 1st, 2022.
In conclusion, existing and new Office365 tenants can continue to use SMTP basic authentication until Microsoft offers an alternative mechanism for authentication. If you haven't already, please switch to OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for SMTP communication as soon as it is available.",0.6986833810806274,"azure, smtp, office365",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

i dont understand much about Api and Json, but should be some information inside.

   itemBuilder: (context, index) {
   return Text(finalApi![widget.index].sources.toString());

","your listview is on sources, so if you want to show sources you need use its index on it. try this:
ListView.builder(
   shrinkWrap: true,
   itemCount: finalApi![widget.index].sources.length,
   itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return Text(finalApi![widget.index].sources[index].text);//&lt;--- change this
  },
 ),

","  It looks like you're trying to display a list of sources from a Flutter API call. You're using the `ListView.builder` method to build the list, but you're encountering an issue when trying to display the list items.
Here are a few things you can try to fix the problem:
1. Make sure that the `finalApi![widget.index].sources` list is not null or empty before trying to display it. You can check for this by logging the list or adding a check inside the `itemBuilder` callback to make sure the list is not null or empty.
2. Instead of using `Text(finalApi![widget.index].sources.toString())`, try using `Text(finalApi![widget.index].sources)` directly. This will display the list of sources as a list of text items, rather than trying to convert it to a string and display it as a text widget.
3. Make sure that the `ItemBuilder` callback is called with the correct `context` and `index` arguments. The `context` argument is the context of the widget tree, and the `index` argument is the index of the item in the list. You can check these arguments by logging them or adding a check inside the `itemBuilder` callback to make sure they are correct.
4. If you're still encountering an issue, try adding `debugMode` to your `ListView.builder` call. This will enable debug mode for the `ListView`, which can help you see more information about the list items and why they're not being displayed correctly.
Here's an example of how you can modify your code to try these solutions:
```
ListView.builder(
  shrinkWrap: true,
  itemCount: finalApi![ widget.index ].sources.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if (finalApi![ widget.index ].sources != null && finalApi![ widget.index ].sources.length > 0) {
      return Text(finalApi![ widget.index ].sources[index]);
    } else {
      print('List is null or empty');
    }
  },
)
```

Ensure you have no conflicting VS Code Extensions/Snippets/Plugins installed.
","  No problem! I'm happy to help you troubleshoot the issue with getting the description part in NestJS.
From what you've described, it seems like you're trying to use the NestJS description feature in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but it's not working as expected. Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:
1. Check the NestJS configuration:
Make sure that you have installed and configured NestJS correctly in your VS Code. You can check the official NestJS documentation for the installation and configuration process.
2. Enable the NestJS description feature:
By default, the description feature is not enabled in NestJS. To enable it, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`nestjs describe --enable-description`
This command will enable the description feature in your NestJS application.
3. Check the vscode-nestjs plugin:
The vscode-nestjs plugin is a popular plugin for VS Code that provides additional features for working with NestJS. Make sure that you have installed and enabled this plugin in VS Code. You can install the plugin by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`npm install -g vscode-nestjs`
Once you've installed the plugin, you can enable it in VS Code by following these steps:

a. Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions panel on the left side of the window.
b. Click on the vscode-nestjs plugin and select ""Enable"" to activate it.
4. Check the mouse cursor position:
When you move the mouse cursor between the controller and the method, the description should appear. Make sure that your mouse cursor is positioned correctly in the correct location. If the description is not appearing, try moving your mouse cursor to a different location in the code to see if it's a positional issue.
5. Check for other extensions or plugins:
Some other extensions or plugins may be interfering with the NestJS description feature. Try disabling any unused extensions or plugins and see if it resolves the issue.
6. Clear the cache:
Sometimes, the cache can interfere with the NestJS description feature. Try clearing the cache in VS Code by following these steps:

a. Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions panel on the left side of the window.
b. Find the cache extension (e.g., ""VS Code Cache"") and select ""Clear Cache"" to clear the cache.
7. Check the documentation:
If none of the above steps work, check the official NestJS documentation for troubleshooting tips and common issues. The documentation may provide more detailed information on how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
By following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the issue with the NestJS description feature in VS Code.

Remove autoFocus and add inputRef and onFocus
","  Yes, you can achieve auto focusing on the end of the text in a Material-UI `TextField` component using the `inputRef` prop. Here's an updated example that should work for your use case:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
const BasicTextFields = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('""hello world. hello world. hello world""');
  return (
    <Box
      component=""form""

        multiline
        inputRef={(input) => input.focus()};
      />
    );

```
In this updated example, we added `inputRef={(input) => input.focus()}` to the `TextField` component. This will set the `focus` state of the input element to the end of the text.
Alternatively, you can also use the `onFocus` callback to set the focus to the end of the text. Here's an example:
```jsx

&lt;TextField
  variant=""outlined""

  type=""text""

  id=""field-comment""

  name=""comment""

  label=""Label""

  placeholder=""Placeholder""

  onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}

  inputRef={(input) => input.focus()};

  onFocus={(e) => {
    const value = e.currentTarget.value;
    const endPosition = value.length;
    e.currentTarget.setSelectionRange(endPosition, endPosition);
  }}

  multiline

  rows={4}

  value={value}

  className={classes.sCommentTextField}

/&gt;

In this example, we added an `onFocus` callback that sets the selection range to the end of the text.
Note that in both examples, we removed the `autoFocus` prop from the `TextField` component, as you no longer need it when using `inputRef` or `onFocus`.",0.5421389937400818,"reactjs, material-ui, autofocus",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
72965331,"Async ""not expected"" result","I'm trying to understand how async works. All the examples I've seen use asyncio.sleep, but I would like to get an example without that. Below I have provided a simple example to demonstrate my confusion regarding how async/await works.
import asyncio
import time

from functools import wraps

def timing_async(f):
    @wraps(f)
    async def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        val = await f(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f&quot;Async function {f.__qualname__} finished in {end - start:.2f} seconds&quot;)
        return val
    
    return inner

  
async def _simple_count(n=10000000):
    return [i for i in range(n)]

@timing_async
async def simple_count(n=100000000):
    t = await _simple_count(n)
    return t

@timing_async
async def sleep_short():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return 10


@timing_async
async def sleep_long():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    return 20

async def main():
    tasks = [sleep_long(), sleep_short(),sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

If I run the main function, I will get back:
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_long finished in 0.20 seconds
    
[20, 10, 10]

which looks sensible, since sleep_short takes shorter time to complete. However, if I define the function:
async def main():
    tasks = [simple_count(), sleep_short(), sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

I will get this output:
Async function simple_count finished in 4.18 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds

which implies (?) that the simple_count coroutine is completed first, even though it is much slower to sleep_short.
I am pretty sure this is due to my misconception of how async/await works, so I would appreciate it, if you could help me understand this concept better through this example.
","Asynchronous functions allow you to run concurrent tasks, i.e. coroutines, that yield control back to the caller at certain points. Concurrent execution is by no means parallelization. For the latter you'll want to use threads or processes. Since _simple_count() only performs one lengthy task without ever yielding back control to the calling function, it will block other concurrent tasks until it is done, since you literally await its result in the timing decorator's wrapper.
","In your example, the async function `simple_count` is taking longer to complete because it is performing a CPU-bound operation (generating a list of numbers) synchronously. This blocks the event loop and prevents other coroutines from executing concurrently.

To fix this issue and make the `simple_count` function execute asynchronously, you can use the `asyncio.create_task()` function to offload the CPU-bound operation to a separate task. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
import asyncio
import time

from functools import wraps

def timing_async(f):
    @wraps(f)
    async def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        val = await f(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f""Async function {f.__qualname__} finished in {end - start:.2f} seconds"")
        return val
    
    return inner

async def _simple_count(n=10000000):
    return [i for i in range(n)]

@timing_async
async def simple_count(n=100000000):
    task = asyncio.create_task(_simple_count(n))
    t = await task
    return t

@timing_async
async def sleep_short():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return 10

@timing_async
async def sleep_long():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    return 20

async def main():
    tasks = [simple_count(), sleep_short(), sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

","To fix the issue, you need to make a small adjustment in your JSON and modify the trans component in your React code. 

First, update your JSON to include placeholders for the link component. Instead of directly including the `<privacy_policy>` tag in the `terms_of_use` translation, use a placeholder like `<0>`. Here's the updated JSON:

```json
""terms_of_use"": ""Ich stimme der App <0>Datenschutzbestimmungen</0> zu"",
""privacy_policy"": ""Datenschutzbestimmungen""
```

Next, modify your trans component in the React code to use the updated placeholders. Here's the modified code:

```jsx
<Trans
  i18nKey=""login_screen:terms_of_use""
  components={{
    '0': (
      <TouchableOpacity
        onPress={() => {

      >
        <Link>{t('privacy_policy')}</Link>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    ),
  }}
/>
```

Now, the translation will correctly include the link component, and the output will be:

```
Ich stimme der App Datenschutzbestimmungen zu
```

This should resolve the issue and display the desired text with the link component included.",0.7076116800308228,"javascript, reactjs, react-native, i18next",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

In this code, we are using a dictionary `data_dict` to store the items with the minimum path for each folder. We iterate over the `data` list, get the directory name using `os.path.dirname()`, and check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it doesn't exist, we add the item to the dictionary. If it does exist, we compare the length of the current item's name with the existing item's name and update the dictionary if the current item has a shorter path.

Finally, we create a new list `result` by extracting only the 'name' key from each item in the `data_dict.values()`.

","Turn your colors function into a ViewBuilder.  Add @ViewBuilder, return some View, and remove the return statements.  Then this function will return the appropriate View based upon the backgroundColor:

}

","To achieve the desired functionality, you can modify the `colors()` function to take a parameter `backgroundColor` of type `BackgroundType`. Based on the value of `backgroundColor`, you can return either a `LinearGradient` or an `AngularGradient` as the background color. Here's an updated version of the code:

```swift
enum BackgroundType {
    case linear
    case angular
}

func colors(backgroundColor: BackgroundType) -> ShapeStyle {
    if backgroundColor == .linear {
        return LinearGradient(
            gradient: Gradient(colors: [
                Color(red: 135/255, green: 206/255, blue: 235/255),
                Color(red: 255/255, green: 160/255, blue: 122/255)

            angle: .degrees(180 + 45)
        )
    }
}
```

Now, when you call the `colors()` function, you can pass either `.linear` or `.angular` as the `backgroundColor` parameter to get the respective gradient type. For example:

```swift
let linearGradient = colors(backgroundColor: .linear)
let angularGradient = colors(backgroundColor: .angular)
```

You can then use these gradient values as the background color in the `.background()` modifier or wherever you need them.",0.865463376045227,"ios, swift, iphone, swiftui, mobile-development",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I am trying to select rows from job table where id of job not in job_application table and freelancer id = (i and providing manually) but query editor freezes and crashes when i try to run this.
","The database is likely trying to join these tables on your != condition, and as a result is producing (or trying to produce) a cartesian product of the tables. Essentially all records from job are being joined with all records from job_application. Depending on table sizes this is likely a HUGE result.
Instead use NOT IN in your WHERE clause to filter the records in job:
SELECT job.*
FROM job
WHERE job.id NOT IN 
    (
         SELECT jobID 
         FROM job_application

    )

","The issue you are facing with the SQL query editor crashing could be due to a few reasons. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem:

1. Check for syntax errors: Make sure there are no syntax errors in your query. In the given query, the join condition is missing, and it's recommended to use explicit join syntax. Here's an updated version of your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT job.*
   FROM job
   LEFT JOIN job_application ON job.id = job_application.jobId
   WHERE job_application.jobId IS NULL
   AND job_application.freelancerId = '4ac4bac0-23bf-4ff6-a3a6-61282e87f7bc';
   ```

2. Optimize the query: If the tables `job` and `job_application` have a large number of rows, the query may take a long time to execute and cause the editor to freeze or crash. You can optimize the query by adding appropriate indexes on the columns used in the join and filtering conditions. Indexes can significantly improve the query performance.

3. Check server resources: Ensure that your SQL server has enough resources allocated to handle the query. If the server is running low on memory or processing power, it may struggle to execute complex queries, leading to crashes. Consider monitoring the server's resource usage and adjusting the configuration accordingly.

4. Update the SQL editor: If you are using a specific SQL query editor, make sure it's up to date with the latest version. Older versions may have bugs or compatibility issues that can cause crashes. Try using a different SQL editor or updating the current one to see if the issue persists.

5. Split the query: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you can try splitting the query into smaller parts and executing them separately. For example, you can first retrieve the list of `job_application` rows for the given `freelancerId` and then use that result to filter the `job` table. This approach can help identify the specific part of the query causing the problem.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to provide more details about the environment you are working in, such as the specific SQL editor, database engine, and any error messages or logs you receive when the crash occurs.",0.6923238039016724,"sql, database, amazon-web-services, amazon-rds",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

WHERE row_num = CASE WHEN MAX(rnk) OVER (PARTITION BY cust) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 2 END;
```

In the above query, the inner subquery assigns a row number to each row within each `cust` group, ordering them by `rnk` in descending order. Then, the outer query filters the result based on the condition you mentioned:

- If the maximum `rnk` for a `cust` is 1, it selects the row with `row_num = 1`.
- Otherwise, it selects the row with `row_num = 2`.

The result will be:

As I understand, this app will follow the Win32 App model, that is, the app will not run on sandbox and the app will not have activation and lifecycle management like UWP apps. Is this right?
In this case, How can we use Win32 APIs in this project, and can we follow the event loop like the WNDPROC callback function instead of Application::Start()?
Thank You
","I found that you have posted the same case on the Q&amp;A forum: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1095079/winui3-understanding-winui3-desktop-app.html
You could refer to the answer provided by Castorix 31. To prevent the link from expiring, I will post the answer to Castorix 31:

Application::Start replaces the main message loop.
As it is a Win32 app, you can have access to the main window WndProc with
SetWindowSubclass.

","When creating a WinUI3 app in a desktop app, it means that you are building a desktop application using the Win32 App model but leveraging the WinUI3 framework for the user interface. This allows you to take advantage of the modern UI controls and features provided by WinUI3 while still using the Win32 programming model.

You are correct that WinUI3 desktop apps do not run in a sandbox and do not have the same activation and lifecycle management as UWP apps. They have more flexibility and can interact more directly with the underlying system.

To use Win32 APIs in a WinUI3 desktop app, you can simply include the necessary headers and use the APIs as you would in any other Win32 application. You have access to the full range of Win32 APIs for tasks such as file I/O, networking, and system interaction.

Regarding the event loop, you have the option to use the traditional WNDPROC callback function if you prefer. WinUI3 allows you to create and manage windows using the Win32 programming model. You can handle window messages and events using the WNDPROC callback function or the newer Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events provided by WinUI3.

However, it's worth noting that WinUI3 also provides a higher-level programming model with the Application class, which includes the Application::Start() method. This method sets up the application's event loop and handles the message pump for you. It simplifies the development process by abstracting away some of the low-level details of the Win32 message loop.

So, while you can use the WNDPROC callback function and handle the event loop manually, using the Application class and its Start() method can provide a more convenient and modern way of managing the application's lifecycle and events.

In summary, creating a WinUI3 desktop app allows you to build a desktop application using the Win32 App model and leverage the WinUI3 framework for the UI. You can use Win32 APIs, including the event loop with the WNDPROC callback function, or opt for the higher-level programming model provided by the Application class.",0.5923989415168762,"c++, winapi, windows-runtime, winui-3",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

You shoud avoid variable names that are code words as well --&gt; like to in For i = 1 to 10.
","To fix the error you're encountering, you need to properly pass the userform as a variable to the function. Here's an updated version of your code:

Private Sub btnback_Click()
    Call back_menu(Me)
End Sub

Sub back_menu(stage As Object)
    Unload stage
    Menu.Show
End Sub

In this updated code, `Me` represents the current userform (the one that contains the button). By passing `Me` as an argument to the `back_menu` function, you can reference the userform within the function and unload it properly.

As for your second example, you can use a similar approach:

Sub next_page(from As Object, toForm As Object)
    Unload from
    toForm.Show
End Sub

In this case, you can pass both the current userform and the userform you want to navigate to as arguments to the `next_page` function. The `Unload` statement unloads the current userform, and then you can show the desired userform using the `Show` method.

By properly passing the userforms as objects to the functions, you should be able to navigate between forms without encountering the ""Type mismatch"" error.",0.7589199542999268,"vba, function, object, variables, userform",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Solution
Try this, look at this Example Sheet

Paste this formula next to products name and drag down.

Explanation
FILTER the range $B$2:$L$16 where the headers $L$1 = the value in range N2:N12 products, the output is TRUE and FALSE Array.
count TRUE value in the Array resulted from FILTER with COUNTIF function COUNTIFFILTER[ True / false array ], TRUE TRUE is COUNTIF criterion.

```

Here's a breakdown of the formula:

- `A2:E7` is the range of cells containing the data, where A2 is the top-left cell of the data range, and E7 is the bottom-right cell.
- `""SELECT A, COUNT(B), COUNT(C), COUNT(D), COUNT(E) GROUP BY A""` specifies the columns you want to select and count. In this case, you want to select column A (the products) and count the occurrences of each product in columns B to E.
- `LABEL A 'Product', COUNT(B) 'Company 1', COUNT(C) 'Company 2', COUNT(D) 'Company 3', COUNT(E) 'Company 4'""` provides labels for the selected columns in the resulting query.

Make sure to adjust the range `A2:E7` in the formula to match the actual range of your data. After entering the formula, it will display the queried and counted results in the desired format.",0.5686326622962952,google-sheets,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

If the input tensor's 0th value on dimension 1 == 0, I want to reverse the entire dimension 1 of that specific sample; otherwise, leave it alone. I am actually working with a 3-dimensional tensor (batch, horizon, feature) but I simplified the example tensors here.
","Assuming you tried everything in your power to solve this, here is something that might be useful:

","To reverse a specific dimension/sample of a tensor only when a per-dimension/sample condition is met, you can use the following steps in Python using TensorFlow:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
```

2. Define the input tensor:
```python
input_tensor = np.array([[1., 1., 1., 1.],
                        [1., 1., 1., 0.],
                        [1., 1., 0., 0.],
                        [1., 0., 0., 0.],

                        [0., 0., 1., 1.],
                        [0., 1., 1., 1.]])
```

3. Convert the input tensor to a TensorFlow tensor:
```python
input_tensor_tf = tf.constant(input_tensor)
```

4. Define the condition for reversing a specific dimension/sample:
```python
condition = tf.equal(input_tensor_tf[:, 0], 0)
```

5. Use `tf.cond` to apply the condition and reverse the dimension if the condition is met:
```python
reversed_tensor = tf.cond(condition,
                          lambda: tf.reverse(input_tensor_tf, [1]),
                          lambda: input_tensor_tf)
```

6. Run the TensorFlow session to get the reversed tensor:
```python
with tf.Session() as sess:
    reversed_output = sess.run(reversed_tensor)
```

Now, `reversed_output` will contain the desired reversed tensor.

73526145,How to implement near-real time autocompletion using lucene?,"Lucene offers different Autocompletion options:
org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.Lookup
I was using the AnalyzingSuggester which is good but it does not support changing data, i.e. when the index changes one needs to reindex everything.
Therefore I tries out the AnalyzingInfixSuggester. This has and add method and an update method but no remove.
Does someone know if it is possible to implement near-real time suggestions with pure lucene?
","I do not know why this is not part of the public implementation. At the end I extended the AnalyzingInfixSuggester like this:
public class MyAnalyzingInfixSuggester extends AnalyzingInfixSuggester {

    public MyAnalyzingInfixSuggester(Directory dir, Analyzer analyzer) throws IOException {
        super(dir, analyzer);
    }

    public void remove(String text) throws IOException, NoSuchMethodException, InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException {
        // call method ensureOpen via reflection since it is private
        Method method = AnalyzingInfixSuggester.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;ensureOpen&quot;);
        method.setAccessible(true);
        method.invoke(this);
        Query query1 = new TermQuery(new Term(TEXT_FIELD_NAME, text.toLowerCase()));

        BooleanQuery booleanQuery = new BooleanQuery.Builder()
                .add(query1, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST)
                .build();
        writer.deleteDocuments(booleanQuery);
    }
}

","To implement near-real time autocompletion using Lucene, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance of `AnalyzingInfixSuggester` from the `org.apache.lucene.search.suggest` package. This class is designed for providing autocompletion suggestions based on partial input.

2. Build an `AnalyzingInfixSuggester` instance with an `Analyzer` and a directory where the index will be stored. The `Analyzer` is responsible for tokenizing and analyzing the input text.

3. Use the `add` method of the `AnalyzingInfixSuggester` to add new suggestions to the index. This method takes a `CharSequence` key and a weight as parameters. The key represents the suggestion, and the weight determines the order of suggestions.

4. Use the `update` method of the `AnalyzingInfixSuggester` to update existing suggestions in the index. This method also takes a `CharSequence` key and a weight as parameters.

5. To implement near-real time suggestions, you can periodically update the index with new suggestions or updates. For example, you can schedule a job to run at regular intervals and fetch new data from a data source, then add or update the suggestions in the index accordingly.

6. To remove suggestions from the index, you can use the `delete` method of the `AnalyzingInfixSuggester`. However, note that this method is not available in the current version of Lucene (8.10.1). If you need to remove suggestions, you may have to reindex everything or use a workaround like marking suggestions as deleted and filtering them during retrieval.

7. To get autocompletion suggestions, you can use the `lookup` method of the `AnalyzingInfixSuggester`. This method takes a `CharSequence` query and a maximum number of suggestions to return. It returns a list of `LookupResult` objects, which contain the suggested completions and their corresponding weights.

By following these steps, you can implement near-real time autocompletion using Lucene's `AnalyzingInfixSuggester`. However, note that removing suggestions may require additional handling, depending on your specific requirements and the version of Lucene you are using.",0.3785000741481781,"autocomplete, lucene",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

type Unit struct{
    category struct{
        name string
    }
}

","Doing the following:
var unit = Unit{
    category: {
        name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

will NOT work because the language specification says that you MUST specify the type when initializing a struct's field with a composite literal value. E.g. a nested struct, or a map, or a slice, etc.

Since category's type is an unnamed composite type, to initialize the field you MUST repeat the unnamed composite type's definition.
type Unit struct{
    category struct{
        name string
    }
}

var unit = Unit{
    category: struct{
        name string
    }{
        name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

Alternative, do not use anonymous structs.
type Category struct {
    name string
}

type Unit struct{
    category Category
}

var unit = Unit{
    category: Category{
        name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

And if you want to use this struct outside of the package in which it is declared you MUST export its fields
type Category struct {
    Name string
}

type Unit struct{
    Category Category
}

// ...

var unit = mypkg.Unit{
    Category: mypkg.Category{
        Name: &quot;foo&quot;,
    },
}

","The issue you are facing is related to the usage of an anonymous nested struct in the `Unit` struct. In Go, anonymous structs are not directly accessible outside their parent struct. To fix this problem, you need to define the nested struct with a name.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
type Category struct {
    name string
}

type Unit struct {
    category Category
}
```

By giving the nested struct a name (`Category` in this case), you make it accessible and usable within the `Unit` struct.

Now, you can create instances of the `Unit` struct and set the `name` field of the `category` struct:

```go
unit := Unit{
    category: Category{
        name: ""example"",
    },
}
```

You can access the `name` field as follows:

```go
fmt.Println(unit.category.name) // Output: example
```

p.s. this is done in .NET 6
","Yes, in C#, you can access the last 3 elements of an array and modify them in a single statement using the Array.Copy method along with LINQ. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```csharp
int[] arr = { 3, /* ... */, 1, 5, 6 };

Array.Copy(arr, arr.Length - 3, arr, arr.Length - 3, 3);
arr = arr.Select(x => x * 4).ToArray();
```

In the above example, the `Array.Copy` method is used to copy the last 3 elements of the array to their same positions. This is done to avoid modifying any elements before the last 3. Then, the `Select` method from LINQ is used to multiply each element by 4. Finally, the modified array is assigned back to `arr`.

After executing this code, the array will have the desired result:

```
arr[0] = 3
...
...
arr[n-3] = 4
arr[n-2] = 20

2. Modify the `onUserChange` function to parse the input value as an integer before updating the `userId` state. This will ensure that `userId` remains a number.

```jsx
const onUserChange = (event) => {
  const value = parseInt(event.target.value, 10);
  setUserId(value);
}

3. Update the condition for filtering tasks by user ID. Currently, the condition checks if `userId` is truthy, which will always be true since `userId` is initialized with a value of 1. Instead, modify the condition to check if `userId` is not equal to 0.

```jsx
if (userId !== 0) {
  filteredTask = filteredTask.filter((item) => item.userId === userId);

Exception: The parameters (String,String) don't match the method signature for CalendarApp.Calendar.createAllDayEvent.

My script is:
  var SheetApp = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();  
  var SelectedRow = SheetApp.getActiveRange().getRowIndex();
  var value = SheetApp.getRange(SelectedRow, 8).getValue(); //Name of the event

  var eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sampleemail@gmail.com&quot;);
  eventCal.createAllDayEvent(value.toString(), new Date() + 14);

","When you add a number to a Date object, the Date is automatically converted to its underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch. The result of the addition will be that number of milliseconds  plus 14, which is just a big integer. The createAllDayEvent() method expects a Date object rather than an integer.
To get a date that is 14 days from now, use Date.setDate(). This method has the benefit that it automatically takes care of rolling into the next month or next year as necessary, but be careful. The setDate() method modifies a Date object in place, but does not return the Date object. Instead, it returns the underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
This means that you cannot just assign the result you get from setDate() to a variable in the hope of getting a valid Date. Something like const twoWeeksFromNow = new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 14) will not work if you expect twoWeeksFromNow to contain a Date.
An easy way to get it right is to use a short utility function, like this:
function testCreateAllDayEvent() {
  const twoWeeksFromNow = dateOffset_(new Date(), +14);
  const eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sample_email@gmail.com&quot;);
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  const eventTitle = sheet
    .getRange('H' + sheet.getActiveRange().getRow())
    .getDisplayValue();
  eventCal.createAllDayEvent(eventTitle, twoWeeksFromNow);
}

/**

*
* @param {Date} date The date from which to count.
* @param {Number} numDays The number of days to add or subtract from date.
* @return {Date} A new Date object that is offset by numDays from date.
*/
function dateOffset_(date, numDays) {
  const newDate = new Date(date);
  newDate.setDate(date.getDate() + numDays);
  return newDate;
}

","The error you're encountering is because the `createAllDayEvent` method in Google Apps Script's Calendar service expects a `Date` object as the second parameter, but you're passing a string concatenation instead.

To fix the problem and create an all-day calendar event 14 days from today, you should modify your script as follows:

```javascript
var SheetApp = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
var SelectedRow = SheetApp.getActiveRange().getRowIndex();
var value = SheetApp.getRange(SelectedRow, 8).getValue(); // Name of the event

var eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(""sampleemail@gmail.com"");

var startDate = new Date(); // Get today's date
startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + 14); // Add 14 days

eventCal.createAllDayEvent(value.toString(), startDate);
```

In this updated script, we create a `Date` object `startDate` and set it to today's date using `new Date()`. Then, we use the `setDate` method to add 14 days to `startDate`. Finally, we pass `value.toString()` as the event name and `startDate` as the event start date to the `createAllDayEvent` method.

This should resolve the error and create the all-day calendar event 14 days from today.",0.5405722856521606,"javascript, datetime, google-apps-script, google-calendar-api",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Your first problem lies in your response.
&quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n&quot;

That allows for keep-alive, which you're not handling. A basic JMeter sampler tries to use keep alive, that is why you always fail on the second attempt.
You can change it to
&quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n&quot;

That does not support keep alive, so you'll get a lot more successes with your current code. For me I only get a couple 1000 responses before JMeter has another error, but I don't know what the error is.
To support keep alive, I need to parse the request. Here is an example.

This will run a JMeter test for me. It can use either 1.0 or 1.1 and finish 10's of thousands of requests. If I use keep alive (1.1) each client handles many requests, if I don't use keep alive (1.0) each client handles 1 request.
If I dont read the request header, then the http 1.0 version will stop after a couple thousand requests.
It is also a separate issue from your original &quot;dies after the second request.&quot; which is because your are not actually using HTTP 1.1 !
","The problem with the provided code is that the server socket is closed immediately after the first request is handled. This causes subsequent requests to fail because the server socket is no longer available.

To fix this issue, you need to move the `serverSocket.close()` statement outside of the while loop. This will keep the server socket open to handle multiple requests. Here's the updated code:

```java
public class Service {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        var serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        var executors = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

                                serverSocket.getLocalPort() + ""..."");

                        var response = ""HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"" +

                        server.getOutputStream().write(response.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

                            System.out.println(""Executor error2: "");
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }

                e.printStackTrace();
                break;
            }
        }

        // Move the serverSocket.close() outside of the while loop
        serverSocket.close();

73073571,Go - JSON validation throwing error unless I use pointer in the struct. Why?,"Here is my validation structure:
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:&quot;username&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    Email          string `json:&quot;email&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
    IsRefreshEmail *bool  `json:&quot;isRefreshEmail&quot; validate:&quot;required&quot;`
}

I'm pointing the value of IsRefreshEmail with *bool. If I remove the pointer and I try to call my API without it, the API will throw a bad syntax error.
That will happen only if the boolean value will be false. If it's true even if you remove the pointer the API will respond correctly.
Why is this happening? It's normal? I can't understand it and i don't even know if I'm doing it wrong with the pointer. What I surely know is that if I remove the * from bool and I insert false as value in postman for the field isRefreshEmail the API will throw an exception.
Someone can explain please? Thank you.
","A boolean can represent two values, false or true:
var IsRefreshEmail bool

A boolean pointer can represent three values, false, true or nil:
var IsRefreshEmail *bool

The benefit of this, is that you can compare false with nil:
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;isRefreshEmail&quot;: false}
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;}

without the pointer, the two JSON above will be identical after Unmarshal.
Depending on your situation, you might not care about that. However if you need
to know if the value was omitted, then pointer is required.
","The reason you are experiencing this behavior is due to how Go handles zero values for different types, including boolean values. In Go, a boolean variable with a zero value (in this case, false) is considered as uninitialized or not set.

When you define the `IsRefreshEmail` field as a pointer (`*bool`), it allows the value to be either a valid boolean or a nil pointer. This means that if you omit the field in your JSON payload, it will be set to nil. In this case, the validation library will not consider it as a required field because a nil pointer is considered as a valid value for the pointer type.

However, if you remove the pointer (`bool`), the field becomes a non-pointer boolean type. In Go, a non-pointer boolean type cannot be nil, so it will always have a zero value of false if not explicitly set. When the validation library tries to validate the field, it sees the zero value and considers it as unset or missing, which triggers the required validation error.

To fix this issue, you have a few options:

1. Keep the field as a pointer (`*bool`) and update your validation rules to allow a nil pointer as a valid value. For example, you can modify the validation tag to: `validate:""required,eq=0|eq=1|eq=null""`

2. Change the field type to a custom type that implements the `json.Unmarshaler` interface. This way, you can handle the zero value behavior yourself and make the field optional. Here's an example:

```go
type NullableBool bool

func (nb *NullableBool) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
    if string(data) == ""null"" {
        return nil
    }
    var value bool
    err := json.Unmarshal(data, &value)
    if err == nil {
        *nb = NullableBool(value)
    }
    return err
}

type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string       `json:""username"" validate:""required""`
    Email          string       `json:""email"" validate:""required""`
    IsRefreshEmail NullableBool `json:""isRefreshEmail""`
}
```

By using this approach, if the `isRefreshEmail` field is not present in the JSON payload, it will be treated as nil and will not trigger the required validation error.

3. Another approach is to use a custom validation function instead of relying solely on struct tags. You can define a custom validation function that checks whether the field is present or not. This way, you have more control over the validation process and can handle the zero value behavior yourself. Here's an example:

```go
type PostEmail struct {
    Username       string `json:""username"" validate:""required""`
    Email          string `json:""email"" validate:""required""`
    IsRefreshEmail bool   `json:""isRefreshEmail""`
}

func validatePostEmailStruct(p *PostEmail) error {
    if !p.IsRefreshEmail {
        // Handle the case when the field is required but has a zero value
        return errors.New(""isRefreshEmail is required"")
    }
    return nil
}
```

In this approach, you can define a custom validation function that checks the field explicitly and returns an error if the field is required but has a zero value.

Remember to import the necessary packages (`encoding/json`, `github.com/pkg/errors`, and any validation library you are using) to make the above code work correctly.

Choose the approach that best fits your use case and coding style.",0.5971974730491638,"json, validation, go",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74603346,Postgres 9.3 Symlinks in pg_tblspc broken,"I have a postgres 9.3 database in a windows installation. The complete installation is on a raid installed.
We wanted to replace that raid with new drives since the old ones started to die. We copied all data from the raid to a new drive with the file explorer (wasn't me...), then replaced all drives and created a new raid, put back on all the old data and changed the drive letter back to the old one. Thinking that everything would work as normal.
Sadly not with postgres. The copying with file explorer destroyed all symlinks in the pg_tblspc folder. They arent symlinks anymore, they are just empty folders. So I have now 147 broken symlinks...
I checked how the symlinks working and compared to a working postgres installation. I found out that every table has an OID. For each OID there are 2 symlinks in that folder. The symlinks have an increased number.
For example, the OID of a table is 17530, then I have 2 symlinks 17538 and 17541. These pointing towards the data folder with the database name. In the folder with the database name I have 2 folders again. One of these symlinks pointing to one of these folders.
The increased numbers are always so same. So its always OID +8 and +11 (on other working installation its always +4 and +7).
All the table management is done by a program (FTK). So if you do stuff in there, its creating/deleting/updating the databases and tables for you. I think that its always 2 folders in there is because FTK is doing that in that way.
My question is now: Can I just manually create these symlinks? And then everything should work? Or is there maybe a function from postgres, where I can point to the &quot;new&quot; folder and it recreates the symlinks? It looks like the symlinks are managed by postgres itself. But so far I couldnt find anything about a repair function
","Mistake number one was not to take a backup. Mistake number two was to create 147 tablespaces. But let's no dwell on that. What can you do?
First, facts. In the directory pg_tblspc is one symbolic link per tablespace, not per table. The name of the symbolic link is the object ID of the tablespace. You can find the object IDs with
SELECT oid, spcname FROM pg_tablespace;

Then you have to figure out what directory belong to which tablespace. There i no help for that, since that is the information that got lost. Once you know the path for a tablespace:

change to the pg_tblspc directory

run
ln -s /path/to/tablespace 12345

where 12345 is the OID of the tablespace.


Needless to say, PostgreSQL must be shut down when you do that.  Once you have re-created the symbolic links for all tablespaces, you should be good.
","To fix the issue with broken symlinks in the pg_tblspc folder in your PostgreSQL 9.3 installation, you can try the following steps:

1. First, make sure you have a backup of your database files before proceeding with any changes to the symlinks.

2. Identify the original location of the database files before they were copied with the file explorer. This will be the location where the symlinks should point to.

3. Create a new folder in the pg_tblspc directory for each broken symlink. The folder names should follow the pattern of OID + 8 and OID + 11 (or OID + 4 and OID + 7 if that's the pattern you observed in a working installation).

4. Inside each new folder, create a symlink that points to the original location of the corresponding database. You can use the `mklink` command in Windows to create the symlinks. For example: `mklink /D C:\path\to\pg_tblspc\17538 C:\path\to\original\database`.

5. Repeat the above steps for all the broken symlinks in the pg_tblspc folder.

6. Once you have recreated all the necessary symlinks, restart the PostgreSQL service to ensure that it picks up the changes.

7. Verify that the symlinks are now working correctly by accessing the databases and tables through the PostgreSQL server.

It's important to note that manually recreating the symlinks is not a recommended approach, as it may lead to further issues if not done correctly. If possible, it's always better to restore from a backup or consult a professional PostgreSQL administrator for assistance.

Additionally, it's worth considering upgrading to a newer version of PostgreSQL, as version 9.3 is quite old and no longer actively supported. Upgrading to a newer version will provide better stability, performance, and access to new features and bug fixes.",0.6012121438980103,"postgresql, postgresql-9.3",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73583513,Get a subresource with api-platform for a User's roles in Symfony5,"In Symfony5 security Roles are plain strings. So, a User entity generally has a $roles array that stores the role name strings, for example:
class User {
  /** @ORM\Column(type=&quot;json&quot;) */
  protected array $roles = ['ROLE_USER'];
  // ...
}

However, in my environment I want to enrich Roles with descriptions and other meta data, so I have a Role class, and I want to be able to fetch a list of roles for a single user using the api-platform framework (note: fetching a collection of Roles is not an issue and can be done  out-of-the-box).
","This can be accomplished by defining a custom Subresource DataProvider in Api-Platform. And the beautiful part is all filters and pagination will work naturally (however, the filters will not show up in the API Docs; I'm not sure how to fix that).

Define the @ApiSubresource on your User::$roles property:

/**
 * @ApiSubresource(maxDepth=1)
 * @ORM\Column(type=&quot;json&quot;)

protected array $roles = [];


Create your DataProvider. This is what I use but could use some improvements to be more generic.

Configure the service

App\DataProvider\UserRoleDataProvider:
    arguments:
        $collectionExtensions: !tagged api_platform.doctrine.orm.query_extension.collection


You can now call your route: path('api_users_roles_get_subresource', {id: user.id})

It took me a bit to figure this out, so I hope this helps someone.
","To fetch a subresource of a User's roles using api-platform.com in Symfony5, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the Role entity:
   ```php
   // src/Entity/Role.php
   
   namespace App\Entity;
   
   use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
   
   /**
    * @ORM\Entity
    */
   class Role
   {
       /**
        * @ORM\Id
        * @ORM\GeneratedValue
        * @ORM\Column(type=""integer"")
        */
       private $id;
   
       /**
        * @ORM\Column(type=""string"")
        */
       private $name;
   
       /**
        * @ORM\Column(type=""text"")
        */
       private $description;
   
       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

2. Update the User entity to have a ManyToMany relationship with the Role entity:
   ```php
   // src/Entity/User.php
   
   namespace App\Entity;
   
   use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
   use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection;
   use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
   
   /**
    * @ORM\Entity
    */
   class User
   {
       // ...
   
       /**
        * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity=""App\Entity\Role"")
        * @ORM\JoinTable(name=""user_roles"",
        *     joinColumns={@ORM\JoinColumn(name=""user_id"", referencedColumnName=""id"")},
        *     inverseJoinColumns={@ORM\JoinColumn(name=""role_id"", referencedColumnName=""id"")}
        * )
        */
       private $roles;
   
       public function __construct()
       {
           $this->roles = new ArrayCollection();
       }
   
       /**
        * @return Collection|Role[]
        */
       public function getRoles(): Collection
       {
           return $this->roles;
       }
   
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. Create a new resource configuration file for the Role entity:
   ```yaml
   # config/api_platform/resources/Role.yaml
   
   App\Entity\Role:
       collectionOperations: { }
       itemOperations:
           get: { }
   ```

4. Update the User resource configuration file to include subresource definition for roles:
   ```yaml
   # config/api_platform/resources/User.yaml
   
   App\Entity\User:
       collectionOperations: { }
       itemOperations:
           get: { }
       subresourceOperations:
           roles:
               method: 'GET'
               normalization_context:
                   groups: ['user:roles:read']
   ```

5. Create a custom serialization group for the Role entity in `config/packages/api_platform.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   api_platform:
       mapping:
           paths:
               - '%kernel.project_dir%/config/api_platform/resources'
       serialization:
           groups:
               user:roles:read: ['id', 'name', 'description']
   ```

6. Now, you can fetch the subresource of a User's roles by making a GET request to `/api/users/{id}/roles` endpoint, where `{id}` is the identifier of the User entity.

By following these steps, you should be able to fetch a subresource with api-platform.com for a User's roles in Symfony5.",0.684873104095459,"php, symfony, api-platform.com",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73858913,How to pass IJSObjectReference to JS code as argument,"I've already read that I can invoke JS methods on IJSObjectReference but how to pass such object to JS code as an argument?
Let' say I have such JS code:
    addLayer: function (group,layer) {
      ...

In C# I have two references IJSObjectReference for both &quot;group&quot; and &quot;layer&quot;, how do I pass them to such function?

Obtaining JS reference, example.
    createGroup: function () {
        var js_group = L.markerClusterGroup();
        return js_group;
    },


and C# call:
var js_ref = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync&lt;IJSObjectReference&gt;($&quot;{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.createGroup&quot;).ConfigureAwait(false);

","You can invoke addLayer function using IJSRuntime and pass the IJSObjectReferences as parameters after the function identifier.
@inject IJSRuntime JS

@code {
    private IJSObjectReference _groupJSObjectRef;
    private IJSObjectReference _layerJSObjectRef;

    ...

    private async Task SomeMethodAsync()
    {
        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync($&quot;{MarkerClusterInterop.BaseObjectContainer}.addLayer&quot;, _groupJSObjectRef, _layerJSObjectRef);
    }
}

","To pass an `IJSObjectReference` to JavaScript code as an argument, you can use the `InvokeVoidAsync` method provided by the `IJSRuntime` interface in Blazor.

Here's an example of how you can pass the `IJSObjectReference` objects for ""group"" and ""layer"" to the JavaScript `addLayer` function:

```csharp
// Get the IJSObjectReference for the ""group"" and ""layer""
var groupRef = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(""createGroup"");
var layerRef = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(""createLayer"");

// Invoke the JavaScript addLayer function with the IJSObjectReference objects as arguments
await jsRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync(""addLayer"", groupRef, layerRef);
```

In this example, we first obtain the `IJSObjectReference` for both ""group"" and ""layer"" using the `InvokeAsync` method on `jsRuntime`. Then, we use the `InvokeVoidAsync` method to invoke the JavaScript `addLayer` function and pass the `groupRef` and `layerRef` as arguments.

Make sure that the JavaScript `addLayer` function is accessible in your JavaScript code and that it expects two arguments of type `IJSObjectReference`.

Note: The example assumes that you have defined the `createGroup` and `createLayer` JavaScript functions that return the respective `IJSObjectReference` objects.",0.722758412361145,"javascript, c#, blazor, interop",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73964168,Default CodeIgniter controller not working or is it my htaccess?,"I'm using CodeIgniter 3.1.13 and configured my htaccess file to remove &quot;index.php&quot; but when I try to go to a webpage it doesn't work unless I put the default controller in the URL.  Any advice?
Going to the following URLs work fine...

https://www.example.com
https://www.example.com/index.php
https://www.example.com/welcome
https://www.example.com/welcome/page/test

But the following URL does not work...

https://www.example.com/page/test

How do I get this URL to work?
Here's my htaccess file...

&lt;IfModule !mod_rewrite.c&gt;

# Without mod_rewrite, route 404's to the front controller

&lt;/IfModule&gt;

I changed my config.php to this...
$config['base_url'] = 'https://www.example.com/';
$config['index_page'] = '';

Here's my Welcome.php controller...
&lt;?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

}

function page($pageName)
{
    $data['content'] = $this-&gt;load-&gt;view($pageName, '', TRUE);
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('template_page', $data);
}

}

","$route['default_controller'] only specifies which controller gets executed when the root directory of the website is requested. That is: when no controller/method subdirectory/string is given. In your example that would be when www.example.com or www.example.com/index.php are requested.
The default controller does not get executed when the requested url subdirectory/string starts with one of its methods.
For the www.example.com/page/test url to work, you need to either have a Page controller with a test method in it:
&lt;?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Page extends CI_Controller {

    function __construct()
    {   
        parent::__construct();
    }

    function test()
    {
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('test');
    }

Or add the following to config/routes.php to have the www.example.com/page/* urls be handled by the Welcome controller's page method:
$route['page/(:any)'] = 'welcome/page/$1';

","Based on the details provided, it seems that you have properly configured your .htaccess file and CodeIgniter settings. However, the issue you are facing is related to routing.

In CodeIgniter, the routing configuration determines how URLs are mapped to controllers and methods. By default, CodeIgniter uses a ""segment-based"" routing approach, where each segment of the URL represents a controller, method, or parameter.

To fix the problem and make the URL `https://www.example.com/page/test` work, you need to define a custom route in your CodeIgniter configuration.

Open the `routes.php` file located in the `application/config` directory. Look for the following line:

```php
$route['default_controller'] = 'welcome';
```

Replace it with the following line:

```php
$route['default_controller'] = 'welcome/index';
```

This change ensures that the `index` method of the `Welcome` controller is called when no specific method is specified in the URL.

Save the `routes.php` file and test the URL `https://www.example.com/page/test` again. It should now work as expected.

Additionally, make sure that the file names and class names in your controller match the conventions used by CodeIgniter. The file name should be `Welcome.php`, and the class name should be `Welcome` (with an uppercase ""W"").

If the issue persists, double-check that the `.htaccess` file is located in the root directory of your CodeIgniter installation and that the `mod_rewrite` module is enabled on your server.

```

In this modified code:

1. The `with open('Food.csv', 'rt') as foodfile:` block is used to open the CSV file `Food.csv`. Using the `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.

2. `headers = foodfile.readline().strip().split(',')` reads the header line of the CSV file and splits it into a list of header names.

3. The `for line in foodfile:` loop iterates over the remaining lines in the CSV file.

4. `foodfields = line.strip().split(',')` splits each line into a list of values.

5. The `meal` variable is created as an instance of the `City` class, with the values from the CSV assigned to the corresponding attributes.

6. The `meal` object is then appended to the `meals` list.

After executing this code, you will have a list of `City` objects (`meals`) containing the information from the CSV file.

","You can do normal pivot and then compute/append the total sum:
# do a normal pivot
df = df.pivot_table(
    index=&quot;type&quot;,
    columns=[&quot;fund&quot;, &quot;source&quot;],
    values=&quot;amount&quot;,
    aggfunc=&quot;sum&quot;,
)

# compute &quot;sum&quot; dataframes
dfs = []
for c in df.columns.get_level_values(0).unique():
    s = df.loc[:, c].sum(axis=1, skipna=False)
    dfs.append(pd.DataFrame(s, index=s.index, columns=[(c, f&quot;Total {c}&quot;)]))

# concat them together, sort the columns:
out = pd.concat([df, pd.concat(dfs, axis=1)], axis=1)
out = out[sorted(out.columns)]
print(out)

","To achieve the desired result, you can use the `margins=True` parameter in the `pivot_table` function to get the subtotal and total rows. However, the `pivot_table` function does not support subtotals for specific columns directly. 

To add subtotals for the first pivot column, you can follow these steps:

1. Pivot the original dataframe using the `pivot_table` function, without specifying the `margins=True` parameter:
```python
piv = cpd.pivot_table(index=""type"", columns=[""fund"", ""source""], values=""amount"", aggfunc='sum')
```

2. Calculate the subtotals for the first pivot column by summing the rows for each fund:
```python
piv[""total""] = piv.sum(axis=1)
```

3. Insert the subtotal column in the desired position using the `insert` function:
```python
piv.insert(0, ("""", ""total fund1""), piv[(""fund1"", """")])
piv.insert(3, ("""", ""total fund2""), piv[(""fund2"", """")])
piv.insert(6, ("""", ""total fund3""), piv[(""fund3"", """")])
```

4. Finally, you can add the total row at the bottom using the `margins=True` parameter:
```python
piv = piv.append(piv.sum(numeric_only=True), ignore_index=True)
```

The complete code would look like this:

```python
piv = cpd.pivot_table(index=""type"", columns=[""fund"", ""source""], values=""amount"", aggfunc='sum')
piv[""total""] = piv.sum(axis=1)
piv.insert(0, ("""", ""total fund1""), piv[(""fund1"", """")])
piv.insert(3, ("""", ""total fund2""), piv[(""fund2"", """")])
piv.insert(6, ("""", ""total fund3""), piv[(""fund3"", """")])
piv = piv.append(piv.sum(numeric_only=True), ignore_index=True)
```

This should give you the desired dataframe with subtotals for the first pivot column.",0.7896903157234192,"python, pandas, pivot, subtotal",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73549943,RestSharp not sending certificate but Postman will,"I just can't see what I'm doing wrong. I have a certificate that I obtained (not self signed). I have a pfx file and a password. I added the certificate in Postman and the API call works. I try to add the same certificate using RestSharp and it fails - the server returns a 400 error with a message saying no SSL certificate was supplied.
 public void AttachCertificate(RestClient client)
        {
            try
            {
                
                X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(@&quot;C:\...\xxx.pfx&quot;, &quot;-password-&quot;);
                if (client.Options.ClientCertificates == null) client.Options.ClientCertificates = new X509CertificateCollection();
                if (cert != null) client.Options.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);
            } catch(Exception ex)
            {
                var x = ex;
            }

       
        }

I can see the certificate is there (in RestClient.Options.ClientCertificates) in debugger after this code runs.
This is in .Net Core 3.1
","I figured it out by looking at the source for RestSharp RestClient. In the constructor for RestClient it configures the HttpMessageHandler (HttpClientHandler class) and adds any certificates from RestClient Options. But if you add the certificate to the Options object after the fact (as I was doing), it never goes on to update the underlying HTTP objects.
I'm sure this same issue impacts CookieContainer, AutomaticDecompression, Credentials, Proxy, FollowRedirects, PreAuthenticate, RemoteCertificateValidationCallback options on the HttpClientHandler object; and MaxTimeout, UserAgent and Expect100Continue options on the HttpClient.
IMHO either: setting any of these Options after the RestClient is constructed should cascade to the underlying objects, OR the Options object should be read-only. But that is a decision for the RestSharp developers...
I have just tested my code that I changed to get the PFX certificate BEFORE creating the RestClient, and setting it in the RestClient Options object as passed into the RestClient constructor - and it worked.
","Based on the code you provided, it seems like you are correctly loading the certificate using the `X509Certificate2` class and adding it to the `RestClient.Options.ClientCertificates` collection. However, there are a few additional steps you need to perform in order to ensure that RestSharp sends the certificate during the API call.

1. Verify the certificate file path and password: Make sure that the path to the PFX file is correct and that the password provided is accurate. Double-check the file path and make sure the PFX file exists at that location.

2. Set the `RestClient` `ClientCertificates` property: Instead of setting the certificate in the `Options.ClientCertificates` property, you need to set it directly on the `RestClient` instance.

```csharp
client.ClientCertificates = new X509CertificateCollection();
if (cert != null)
{
    client.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);
}
```

3. Verify the SSL/TLS protocol: Ensure that the server you are connecting to supports the SSL/TLS protocol version used by RestSharp. You can try explicitly setting the protocol version in RestSharp by using the `ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol` property:

```csharp
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
```

4. Enable SSL/TLS certificate validation: Some servers may require certificate validation. You can enable certificate validation by setting the `RestClient` `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` property to a custom validation method. Here's an example:

```csharp
client.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;
```

This example bypasses certificate validation, but in a production environment, you should implement proper certificate validation logic.

Make sure to apply these changes and test your code again. If the issue persists, you might need to provide more information about the server configuration and the specific error message you are receiving to further diagnose the problem.",0.6841906905174255,"c#, ssl, restsharp, x509certificate2",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

        Filename = Dir()
    Loop
    
    ' Enable screen updating again
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True

```

Here's what the modified code does:

1. It declares two Workbook variables `wbSource` and `wbTarget` to represent the source and target workbooks, respectively.
2. It creates a new workbook as the target workbook using `Set wbTarget = Workbooks.Add`.
3. It disables screen updating to improve performance by setting `Application.ScreenUpdating = False`.
4. It loops through each file in the specified folder using `Dir(Path & ""*.xlsx"")`.
5. For each file, it opens the source workbook using `Set wbSource = Workbooks.Open(Filename:=Path & Filename, ReadOnly:=True)`.
6. It loops through each sheet in the source workbook using `For Each ws In wbSource.Sheets`.
7. It checks if the sheet name is ""Sheet 1"" using `If ws.Name = ""Sheet 1"" Then`.
8. If the sheet is found, it copies the sheet to the target workbook using `ws.Copy After:=wbTarget.Sheets(wbTarget.Sheets.Count)` and exits the loop using `Exit For`.
9. It closes the source workbook without saving changes using `wbSource.Close SaveChanges:=False`.
10. It moves to the next file using `Filename = Dir()`.
11. After looping through all the files, it enables screen updating again using `Application.ScreenUpdating = True`.

With these modifications, the code should successfully copy the ""Sheet 1"" from each file in the specified folder to a new workbook. Each copied sheet will be placed in a separate sheet of the target workbook.",0.886566162109375,"excel, vba",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","The argument variable n is an int.
All operations you perform in the function are done using int values. Which you will overflow, leading to undefined behavior.
Change the argument type to unsigned long long.
I also recommend you change the return type to be unsigned as well, if you're not going to get negative results.
","The issue here is that the result of the expression `n*(n+1)/2` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a signed 32-bit integer. As a result, the value overflows and wraps around to a negative number.

To fix this problem, you can explicitly cast the intermediate result to a `long long` before performing the division. Here's an updated version of your code:

```cpp

73646644,default values for record properies,"If I have a Java record with 2 properties and I want to define default values for the properties which should be used instead of null. I can either override the getters
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    @Override
    public Boolean required() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }

    @Override
    public Set&lt;String&gt; strings() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.strings, Set.of());
    }
}

Or I can achieve much the same thing by overriding the default constructor
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    public MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
        this.strings = Objects.requireNonNullElse(strings, Set.of());
        this.required = Objects.requireNonNullElse(required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }
}

Both of these seem a bit verbose, is there a more concise way to assign default values to record properties?
","Overriding the accessor methods like in your first variant violates the expectation that you can create an equal object using the accessor methods and the canonical constructor. From the documentation

For all record classes, the following invariant must hold: if a record R's components are c1, c2, ... cn, then if a record instance is copied as follows:
    R copy = new R(r.c1(), r.c2(), ..., r.cn());

then it must be the case that r.equals(copy).

But with your overridden accessor method, the following assertion fails:
MyRecord r1 = new MyRecord(null, null), r2 = new MyRecord(r1.strings(), r1.required());
assert r1.equals(r2);

because the internal fields contain different data.
So the only correct way to fix input data is during the construction, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        if(strings == null) strings = Set.of();
        if(required == null) required = true;
    }
}

However, you shouldn’t do this null handling at all. Collections should never be null and using Boolean for the constructor implies having a Boolean record component type in general, i.e. also returned by the accessor method. And writing new MyRecord(null, null) instead of new MyRecord(Set.of(), true) doesn’t even save much typing.
If you want to support default values, you should overload the constructor, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
    public MyRecord() {
        this(Set.of(), true);
    }
}

So you can use new MyRecord() for the defaults. Or you consider that records are immutable, so constructing multiple instances of defaults isn’t necessary
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public static final MyRecord DEFAULT = new MyRecord(Set.of(), true);
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
}

and use MyRecord.DEFAULT whenever you need the default values. Of course, you still can provide overloaded constructors for the cases that only one parameter should have default values, if that is needed.
","Yes, there is a more concise way to assign default values to record properties in Java. Starting from Java 14, you can use the new feature called ""Compact Constructors"" to achieve this.

With compact constructors, you can directly assign default values to record properties within the constructor definition itself, without the need for explicit getter overrides or additional constructors.

Here's an example of how you can use compact constructors to assign default values to record properties:

```java
public record MyRecord(Set<String> strings, Boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Objects.requireNonNullElse(strings, Set.of());
        required = Objects.requireNonNullElse(required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }
}
```

In this example, the default values for both `strings` and `required` properties are assigned within the compact constructor block. The `Objects.requireNonNullElse` method is used to check if the property is null and provide the default value if it is.

By using compact constructors, you can achieve the same result with a more concise syntax, eliminating the need for explicit getter overrides or additional constructors.

Note that this feature is available from Java 14 onwards, so make sure you are using a compatible version of Java.",0.5734722018241882,"java, record",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

73504314,"Type hint for ""can be compared"" objects","I am writing several functions that handle ordered datasets.
Sometime, there is an argument that can be a int or float or a timestamp or anything that supports comparison (larger than / smaller than) and that I can use for trimming data for instance.
Is there a way to type-hint such a parameter? The typing module doesn't seem to include this, but is there some other way?
","There is no standard 'comparable' ABC, no, as the rich comparison methods are really very flexible and don't necessarily return booleans.
The default built-in types return NotImplemented when applied to a type they can't be compared with, for example, while specialised libraries like SQLAlchemy and numpy use rich comparison methods to return completely different objects. See the documentation for the rich comparison methods for the details.
But you should be able to define a
a Protocol subclass for specific expectations:
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)

class Comparable(Protocol[T]):
    def __eq__(self: T, other: T) -&gt; bool:
        ...

    def __lt__(self: T, other: T) -&gt; bool:
        ...

    # ... etc

You may need to tweak the protocol to fit your exact expectations, and / or use a non-generic version that's specific to the types you use (perhaps with @overloaded definitions for specific types).
For sorting with the builtin sorted() function, __eq__ and __lt__ suffice.
","Yes, there is a way to type-hint such a parameter in Python. Although the `typing` module does not include a specific type for objects that can be compared, you can use the `typing.TypeVar` function to create a generic type that represents any object that supports comparison.

Here's an example of how you can use `typing.TypeVar` to type-hint the argument that can be compared:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

Comparable = TypeVar('Comparable', int, float, timestamp)  # Add any other types that support comparison

def trim_data(data: List[Comparable], threshold: Comparable) -> List[Comparable]:
    trimmed_data = [item for item in data if item < threshold]
    return trimmed_data
```

In the above example, `Comparable` is a generic type that represents any object that can be compared. You can specify the specific types that support comparison as arguments to `TypeVar`, such as `int`, `float`, and `timestamp` (assuming `timestamp` is a valid type in your code).

By using `Comparable` as the type hint for the argument, you indicate that any object that supports comparison can be passed as an argument to the function.

Note that you need to import `TypeVar` from the `typing` module to use it.",0.5532912015914917,"python, type-hinting",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

PARAM2 = &quot;2&quot;

and the second one that loads this file and uses the params:
def load_params() {
    def parameters = load &quot;params.groovy&quot;
        final_parameter = &quot;&quot;
    
        for (parameter in parameters) {

                final_parameter = parameter.key.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameter.value

Issue is that doing the iteration over parameters is not working. The type is not a map so I cannot access variables like that.
I would use parameters.PARAM1 to handle it, but the first script is dynamic and names change so there is a need to do it without hard defining the name.
Is there any way to change/iterate the parameters to get the &quot;key&quot; and &quot;values&quot;?
","Here are a few things you can do.
Option 01: Make the Parameters a Map
This is the best solution I guess.
// Params file
parameters = [ &quot;PARAM1&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;PARAM2&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;PARAM3&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;PARAM4&quot;: &quot;4&quot;]

return this

Option 02 : Read the Parameters as a file
Instead of loading as a Script, you can read the Params as a File, then iterate over it line-by-line and read the parameters.
Option 03: Get all the Variables defined in the current binding.
This will probably return all the variables in the current Binding, so you may have to filter out the ones you defined in the param file.
def load_params() {
    def parameters = load &quot;params.groovy&quot;
        final_parameter = &quot;&quot;
        paramMap = [:] &lt;&lt; parameters.getBinding().getVariables()
        for (parameter in paramMap) {
            if(final_parameter == &quot;&quot;) {
                final_parameter = parameter.key.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameter.value
            } else {
                final_parameter = final_parameter+ &quot;&amp;|&amp;&quot; + parameter.key.toUpperCase() + &quot;=&quot; + parameter.value
            }
        }
    
        return final_parameter
    }
    
    return this

","To fix the issue of iterating over the groovy file contents, you can modify the second script as follows:

```groovy
def load_params() {
    def parameters = load ""params.groovy""
    def final_parameter = """"

    for (parameter in parameters.getBinding().getVariables()) {
        if (final_parameter == """") {
            final_parameter = parameter.key.toUpperCase() + ""="" + parameter.value
        } else {
            final_parameter += ""&|"" + parameter.key.toUpperCase() + ""="" + parameter.value
        }
    }

    return final_parameter
}

return this
```

In this updated script, we are using the `getBinding().getVariables()` method to access the variables defined in the groovy file. This method returns a `Map` object containing the variable names as keys and their corresponding values. By iterating over this map, we can access the variable names and values dynamically.

The modified script will handle any number of variables defined in the groovy file without hard-coding their names. It will concatenate the variable names and values in the format `KEY=VALUE` using the `&|` delimiter.",0.7670907974243164,"jenkins, groovy, jenkins-pipeline, jenkins-groovy",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

From this server we can create EC2 instances on multiple AWS accounts using secret and access key. However, we would like to launch instance on other AWS accounts using IAM role. Is possible to lauch instances on other AWS accounts using IAM role (Instead of using access and secret key) ?
","The typical setup would be:

Create an IAM Role in each 'other' AWS Account

Give it the same name in each account to keep things simple
Grant it permission to launch an Amazon EC2 instance


To launch an instance in an 'other' account:

Assume the IAM Role in the target account (the desired Account ID would be specified in the chosen IAM Role's ARN)
Use the returned temporary credentials to launch the EC2 instance



","Yes, it is possible to launch instances on other AWS accounts using IAM roles instead of using access and secret keys. Here's how you can fix the problem:

1. Create an IAM role in each of the AWS accounts where you want to launch instances. This role should have the necessary permissions for launching EC2 instances.

2. In the management account, navigate to the IAM console and create a new IAM role. This role will be used by the web application server to assume the IAM role in the target AWS accounts.

3. In the trust relationship of the IAM role created in the management account, specify the AWS account IDs of the target accounts. This allows the management account to assume the IAM role in the target accounts.

4. Attach a policy to the IAM role in the management account that allows it to assume the IAM roles in the target accounts. You can use the `sts:AssumeRole` action for this.

5. On the web application server in the management account, configure the AWS SDK or CLI to use the IAM role created in step 2. This can be done by setting the appropriate environment variables or configuration files.

6. When launching an EC2 instance from the web application server, specify the target AWS account ID and the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the IAM role in that account. This can be done using the `--iam-instance-profile` parameter in the AWS CLI or SDK.

By following these steps, you will be able to launch EC2 instances on other AWS accounts using IAM roles instead of using access and secret keys.

73676116,Specify callback function in dart/flutter that accepts two possible sets of parameters,"Is there a way to create a callback function that accepts one of two different sets of parameters? Or have two separate callback functions as options, and make sure at least one of them is specified?
I have a view that I want to pass a callback function, that either includes a Goal or a title and description (which would end up being put together into a goal).
void Function({required String title, String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString;
void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal;
I want one, but not both of these callbacks to be required - if there is a function with a goal as a parameter, I'd execute that, but if not, I'd execute the one with a String title and a String description. Something like this:
if (onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal != null) {
    // execute this callback function
} else {
    // execute onGoalPopupCompletionWithString
}

","That's not something which can be expressed in the Dart type system.
A single function which can be called as void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}) will have a signature of:
  void Function({String title, String? description, Goal goal})

Any implementation of that type will either have to make title and goal optional, or provide them with default values.
In either case, there is no way, in the type system, to ensure that the function is always invoked as one of the original types.
Also, it'll be highly annoying to write, you'd probably be better off with two different callbacks.
You can provide two callback parameters, one of each kind, and require that at least one of them is required ... but not in the type system. You'd have to make both optional, and check at runtime that at least one was provided.
Having as single parameter which accepts either function type, that requires a union type. A union type allows either one type or another, in this case either void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}). Dart does not have union types in general.
If you need to pass both of these types through the same currently valid Dart type, the type needs to be a supertype of both.
The closest common supertype of those two types is Function.
(The only function types that void Function({required Goal goal}) can be assigned to are void Function({required X goal}) where X is a subtype of Goal. I guess you can also change the void to another, equivalent, top-type.
Any other function type allows its functions to be called in a way that void Function({required Goal goal}) does not.)
Dart does have one kind of type union: Classes with subclasses.
You can declare a callback class:
abstract class MyCallback {
}
class TitleCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required String title, String? description}) callback;
  TitleCallback(this.callback);
}  
class GoalCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required Goal goal}) callback;
  GoalCallback(this.callback);
}  

Then you can require one such callback, and dispatch on it as necessary.
","In Dart/Flutter, you can create a callback function that accepts one of two different sets of parameters by using optional parameters and default values. Here's how you can fix the problem:

```dart
typedef GoalCallback = void Function({required Goal goal});
typedef StringCallback = void Function({required String title, String? description});

void main() {
  void Function({required String title, String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString;
  void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal;

  void executeCallback({required Goal goal, required String title, String? description}) {
    if (onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal != null) {
      onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal(goal: goal);
    } else {
      onGoalPopupCompletionWithString(title: title, description: description);
    }
  }

  // Example usage
  GoalCallback goalCallback = ({required Goal goal}) {
    print(""Goal: ${goal.title}"");
  };

  StringCallback stringCallback = ({required String title, String? description}) {
    print(""Title: $title, Description: $description"");
  };

  onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal = goalCallback;
  onGoalPopupCompletionWithString = stringCallback;

  executeCallback(goal: Goal(title: ""My Goal""));
  executeCallback(title: ""My Title"", description: ""My Description"");
}

class Goal {
  final String title;

  Goal({required this.title});
}
```

In this example, we define two callback function types: `GoalCallback` and `StringCallback`. We then create a function `executeCallback` that accepts both sets of parameters. Inside this function, we check if `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` is not null, and if so, we execute the callback function with the `Goal` parameter. Otherwise, we execute the callback function with the `String` parameters.

You can assign your desired callback functions to the `onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal` and `onGoalPopupCompletionWithString` variables and then call `executeCallback` with the appropriate parameters.

Note that you may need to adjust the types and implementation based on your specific requirements, but this should give you a general idea of how to solve the problem.",0.746365487575531,"dart, callback",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","There is no margin, it's an issue with your form. Try this:

Flex gives you much more flexibility (pun intended) and it's much easier to work with. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
","To fix the issue and unlink the margins between the submit button and the text input, you can make the following changes to your code:

1. Remove the `nomargin` class from the input element, as it is not needed.

2. Add a separate class for the submit button to control its margin independently.

Here's the modified code:

  <form action=""query.php"">
    <label>

    </label>
  </form>
</div>
```

And update your CSS as follows:

```css
.banner {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin: 0;

I would like that when I click on one of the carviews it can go to the activity_pack_detail.
Do you know how to do Intent to PackDetailActivity?
I get this error no matter what I do =&gt;

","You're getting that error because you are calling Intent's class constructor with a wrong argument. The first argument should be a Context and not a View. The keyword this is referring in your code to a View and not to a context, hence the error.
To solve this, you have to pass a Context object like this:
val i = Intent(view.getContext(), PackDetailActivity::class.java)

And your error will go away.
","To fix the issue and implement the onClick function with FirestoreRecyclerAdapter, you need to make the following modifications to your code:

1. In the `UserViewHolder` class, add a click listener to the `itemView` and implement the `onClick` function to start the `PackDetailActivity`:

```kotlin
class UserViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView), View.OnClickListener {
    init {
        itemView.setOnClickListener(this)
    }

    override fun onClick(view: View?) {
        val context = itemView.context
        val intent = Intent(context, PackDetailActivity::class.java)
        // Pass any necessary data to the PackDetailActivity using intent extras
        context.startActivity(intent)
    }
}
```

2. Update the `onCreateViewHolder` method in the `FirestoreRecyclerAdapter` to use the `UserViewHolder`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): UserViewHolder {
    val view = LayoutInflater.from(this@MainActivity).inflate(R.layout.item_pack, parent, false)
    return UserViewHolder(view)
}
```

3. In your `MainActivity` class, make sure to import the `PackDetailActivity`:

```kotlin
import com.example.yourpackage.PackDetailActivity
```

4. Create the `PackDetailActivity` and add it to your manifest file if not already done.

5. Finally, make sure to update the `onBindViewHolder` method in the `FirestoreRecyclerAdapter` to populate the data and handle the click events:

```kotlin
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: UserViewHolder, position: Int, model: User) {
    val tvName: TextView = holder.itemView.findViewById(R.id.title)
    val tvEmojis: TextView = holder.itemView.findViewById(R.id.excerpt)
    tvName.text = model.displayName
    tvEmojis.text = model.emojis

    holder.itemView.setOnClickListener {
        val context = holder.itemView.context
        val intent = Intent(context, PackDetailActivity::class.java)
        // Pass any necessary data to the PackDetailActivity using intent extras
        context.startActivity(intent)
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `com.example.yourpackage` with the actual package name where your `PackDetailActivity` is located.

By following these steps, you should be able to implement the onClick function with FirestoreRecyclerAdapter and navigate to the PackDetailActivity when a card view is clicked.",0.5514222383499146,"android, firebase, kotlin, google-cloud-firestore",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73760219,Dialogflow CX - Transition to page using sentiment analysis score,"Does anyone know if it’s possible to transition to a different page solely off of a sentiment analysis score ($request.sentiment.score) of the end-user’s response?
I basically want the agent to ask the end-user a question and then have the agent route the user to a page strictly using the sentiment analysis score of the user’s response and nothing more

What I tried so far:
Through the Dialogflow-CX simulator, I am trying to transition to a different page using the conditional statement $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 in the route, however the agent does not transition to the next page and cannot match my input to the strictly conditional route (it just jumps to the sys.no-match-default event handler)
Here is a screenshot of the route I have set up:

As you can see, the route has no intents other than a conditional trigger that has $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 as the parameter.
I simply want the agent to direct the end-user to the next page whenever it detects a message with a negative sentiment score. The next screenshot shows that the agent detects that the sentiment score is negative, however the agent does not transition to the next page.

Does anyone know what I seem to be doing wrong?
",,"Based on the information provided, it seems like you're trying to use sentiment analysis score to transition to a different page in Dialogflow CX. However, it appears that your conditional statement is not working as expected.

To troubleshoot the issue, here are a few steps you can follow:

1. Verify sentiment analysis: Make sure that sentiment analysis is enabled for the agent and that it is correctly analyzing the end-user's response. You can test this by checking the sentiment score in the response JSON from Dialogflow CX.

2. Check the conditional statement: Double-check your conditional statement in the route. It should be written as `$request.sentiment.score <= 0` (without the HTML encoding). Ensure that you have used the correct operator and that the syntax is accurate.

3. Test with different scores: Try testing the route with different sentiment scores, both positive and negative, to see if the transition works as expected. This will help you determine if the issue lies with the conditional statement or with the sentiment analysis.

4. Debug using logs: Enable logging in Dialogflow CX and check the logs for any errors or warnings related to the route and the conditional statement. This can provide more insights into why the transition is not happening.

5. Consider using fulfillment: If the above steps don't solve the problem, you might need to consider using fulfillment to handle the sentiment analysis score and perform the transition programmatically. You can write custom code in your fulfillment webhook to analyze the sentiment score and trigger the desired page transition based on your specific logic.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the issue and fix the problem with transitioning to a different page using sentiment analysis score in Dialogflow CX.",0.030099499970674515,dialogflow-cx,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73946426,Listening to one added document in Firestore - Swift,"I'm listening to only one added document in a collection, and after it is read I need this document to be deleted. This is the code I implemented:
func createListener(){
    guard let currentUid = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else { return }
    listener = db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;).document(currentUid).collection(&quot;Collection&quot;).addSnapshotListener({ listenerSnapshot, error in
        if let error = error{
            print(error.localizedDescription)
            return

                let myview = MYView(data: data)
                guard let window = UIApplication.shared.windows.last else { return }
                myview.present(to: window) {
                    change.document.reference.delete()
                }
            }
        })
    })
}

The problem is that after the document is deleted with

change.document.reference.delete()

The listener snippet change.type == .added is triggered even if the document has been deleted. I don't know why...
How can I only listen for actually ADDED documents in a Firestore Collection?
EDIT:
listening for a specific document but still closure called when document is deleted:
listener = db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;).document(currentUid).addSnapshotListener({ listenerSnapshot, error in
        if let error = error{
            print(error.localizedDescription)
            return
        }
        guard let data = listenerSnapshot?.data() else { return }
        let myview = MYView(data: data)
            
        guard let window = UIApplication.shared.windows.last else { return }
        myview.present(to: window) {
            listenerSnapshot?.reference.delete()
        }
    })

","
I'm listening to only one added document in a collection.

No, you're not. You're attaching a snapshot listener to a collection and not to a single document:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

This means that you're listening for real-time updates for each operation that takes place inside the entire sub-collection called &quot;Collection&quot;.
What you're basically doing, you're saying, hey Firestore, give me all documents that exist in that sub-collection and keep the listener alive. This listener will be invoked every time a document in that collection changes over time.
If you want to listen to a single document, then you should add a call to .document() and pass a specific document ID:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(&quot;someDocumentId&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

In this way, you'll only be notified about the changes to a single document.
","The issue you're facing is because the `addSnapshotListener` method in Firestore listens for any changes in the specified collection or document, including additions, modifications, and deletions. So even if you delete a document, the listener will still trigger for that deletion.

To only listen for actually added documents in a Firestore collection, you can modify your code as follows:

```swift
func createListener() {
    guard let currentUid = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else { return }
    listener = db.collection(""Collection"").document(currentUid).collection(""Collection"").whereField(""isDeleted"", isEqualTo: false).addSnapshotListener({ listenerSnapshot, error in
        if let error = error {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
            return
        }
        listenerSnapshot?.documentChanges.forEach({ change in
            if change.type == .added {
                let data = change.document.data()
                
                let myview = MYView(data: data)
                guard let window = UIApplication.shared.windows.last else { return }
                myview.present(to: window) {
                    change.document.reference.updateData([""isDeleted"": true])
                }
            }
        })
    })
}
```

In this modified code, I added a field called ""isDeleted"" to your documents in the collection. By default, this field is set to false. When you present the document in `MYView`, you can update the ""isDeleted"" field to true using `change.document.reference.updateData([""isDeleted"": true])`. This way, the next time the listener triggers, it will only include documents where ""isDeleted"" is false.

Remember to update your Firestore security rules to ensure that only authenticated users can update the ""isDeleted"" field.",0.7508147358894348,"ios, swift, firebase, google-cloud-platform, google-cloud-firestore",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

This output is good in terms of the format but I can’t get it to write to a dictionary.
Example output from the dictionary:
{row “1”: column: &quot;Industry&quot;, message: &quot;gas&quot; is invalid, .... etc}

","This is straightforward, but YOU need to decide what the format will be.  What you have shown above is not a valid dictionary.
Maybe like this, as a list of dictionaries, one for each error?
errors = []
for r, v in df1.mask(mask|df1.eq(' ')).stack().iteritems():
    errors.append({
        &quot;row&quot;: r[0],
        &quot;column&quot;: r[1],
        &quot;message&quot;: v + &quot; is invalid&quot;
    })

","To convert the print statements into a dictionary, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
error_dict = []
for r, v in df1.mask(mask|df1.eq(' ')).stack().iteritems():
    error_dict.append({'row': str(r[0]), 'column': str(r[1]), 'message': f'{v} is invalid'})

print(error_dict)
```

This code initializes an empty list called `error_dict`. Inside the loop, instead of printing the error message, it creates a dictionary with the row, column, and error message, and appends it to the `error_dict` list.

The `error_dict` list will contain dictionaries for each error in the format you mentioned:

```python

    {'row': '1', 'column': 'Industry', 'message': 'gas is invalid'},
    {'row': '1', 'column': 'SME Vertical', 'message': 'hotels is invalid'},

    btn.style.backgroundColor = &quot;red&quot;;
}
let btn1 = document.getElementById(&quot;1&quot;);
btn1.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;,changeColor(btn1));

I know that calling a function in the &quot;addEventListner&quot; immediately call the function . But I do need to pass a object to my function inside &quot;addEventListner()&quot; because I'm planning to use only one general function to handle clicks of 10 buttons.
","From the above comment ...

&quot;A handler function gets passed an Event type to it. An UI event always features a currentTarget and a target property. The OP should access the former ... event.currentTarget.style.backgroundColor = &quot;red&quot;;.&quot;

Instead of using the color changing function as callback one could implement a button specific click handler which forwards its current target to a generic function which changes the background color of any passed element reference.


function changeElementColor(elm){
  elm.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
}
function handleButtonClick(evt) {
  changeElementColor(evt.currentTarget);
}

document
  .querySelectorAll('button')
  .forEach(btnElm =&gt;

    btnElm.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick)
  );
&lt;button&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hallo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button&gt;&lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/button&gt;



","To pass parameters to a function inside the `addEventListener` method, you can use an anonymous function or an arrow function. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:

```javascript
function changeColor(btn){
    btn.style.backgroundColor = ""red"";
}

let btn1 = document.getElementById(""1"");
btn1.addEventListener(""click"", function() {
    changeColor(btn1);
});
```

In the modified code, we wrap the `changeColor` function call inside an anonymous function. This anonymous function is then passed as the event listener to the `addEventListener` method. When the button is clicked, the anonymous function is executed, which in turn calls the `changeColor` function and passes the `btn1` object as a parameter.

By using this approach, you can reuse the `changeColor` function for multiple buttons by simply passing the respective button object as a parameter.",0.7823899984359741,"javascript, function, event-handling, dom-events, addeventlistener",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73546092,How do websites like jam.dev achieve their screenshotting functionality?,"does anyone know how websites like jam.dev achieve their click and drag screenshotting functionality?
I am trying to create a tool which involves screenshotting on the client side and my preferred way was to implement it in a similar fashion. Is anyone kind enough to point me in the right direction?
Some things I have tried and researched, but these don't provide the exact results I want:

html2canvas and other libraries that use svg and foreign object - these just don't produce consistent results.
rendering server side with puppeteer - it would be much better if the screenshotting could be achieved client side.
using webRTC - asking for permission and having the user select a screen/window is just not very intuitive.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
","Browsers share api for extensions that allows making a screenshot
Accoding to this answwer
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(null, {}, function (image) {
   // You can add that image HTML5 canvas, or Element.
});

","Websites like jam.dev achieve their click and drag screenshotting functionality by utilizing the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript. Here is a general approach to implementing such functionality:

1. Capture the initial click event: When the user clicks on the webpage, capture the coordinates of the click event.

2. Capture the drag event: Track the mouse movement after the initial click and capture the coordinates of the drag event.

3. Create a canvas element: Dynamically create a canvas element on the webpage to serve as a drawing surface.

4. Draw a rectangle on the canvas: Using the captured coordinates from the click and drag events, calculate the width and height of the selected area and draw a rectangle on the canvas to represent the screenshot area.

5. Render the webpage content onto the canvas: Use the HTML5 canvas `drawImage` method to render the content of the webpage onto the canvas. You can achieve this by capturing the HTML content of the page or by using a library like html2canvas.

6. Extract the screenshot: Use the `toDataURL` method of the canvas element to extract the screenshot as a base64-encoded image data URL. This can be used to display the screenshot or send it to the server if needed.

By implementing these steps, you should be able to achieve click and drag screenshot functionality on the client-side. However, keep in mind that there may be browser-specific limitations or security restrictions that you need to consider.

Regarding the issues you mentioned with html2canvas and other libraries, it's possible that they may not provide consistent results due to various factors such as browser compatibility or complex webpage structures. You may need to experiment with different libraries or approaches to find one that suits your specific requirements.

73300008,".NET Core Web API only gets JSON from the Mock Lambda Tool. Using Postman, Swagger & AWS Lambda fail","I recently wrote a .NET Core Web API to receive JSON from a Lambda SNS message event. The Lambda sends the SNS event message JSON (via a POST request) to the API.
When I use the 'Mock Lambda Tool' to send the SNS message to the API, all is well. It works great. The data arrives, my API's controller sees it and it sends it over to the class that parses the data sends it into a database.
So, I then published the API to IIS and tested it from the Mock Lambda Tool. That worked too.
Feeling good about the work I uploaded the Lambda to AWS (for real world scenarios), I did a quick test of the same SNS message (JSON) using the AWS Lambda console. It times out.
So, I decided to go back and try testing the API on IIS using Postman. It shows:
**POST** https://my.company.com/api/Transaction/

There is NO error, but note that the Response Body is all nulls.
I decided to run the API from Visual Studio so that I could step through the code as the SNS message arrives from the Lambda.

Using the Mock Lambda Tool, no errors. Data goes all the way through.
Using Postman, a breakpoint on the controller shows no Transaction data arriving (NULL).
Using Swagger, a breakpoint on the controller shows no Transaction data arriving (NULL).

Are there any ideas as to what I am missing or doing incorrectly?
This is my controller in the API:

                );
        }
    }
}

I'm curious if it's my Post Request that is the problem?
Why is the 'Mock Lambda Tool' the only way I can get the data over to the API?
Thanks
","UPDATE. I learned that the Lambda at AWS required a VPC to my internal VM that hosts the API on IIS. That solves why the Lambda at AWS timed out repeatedly.
As for Postman and Swagger problem, the issue is that the Mock Lambda Tool sends the entire SNS message event in its natural full format, then the Lambda extracts the Message portion only to send over to the API.
I was sending this entire SNS message event across Swagger and Postman both of which DO NOT do the work that the Lambda does which is strip just the Message portion out of the SNS event.
Once I sent only the Message portion across with Swagger and Postman, both worked.
I must give credit to my work buddy Dorian for helping me with this. Thanks! :)
","Based on the information provided, there could be a few potential issues causing the problem. Here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the JSON payload: Ensure that the JSON payload being sent from the Lambda function is correctly formatted and matches the expected structure in the API's `Transaction` model. You can log the received JSON payload in the API controller to verify its correctness.

2. Verify the API route: Make sure that the route in the Postman request (`https://my.company.com/api/Transaction/`) matches the `[HttpPost]` attribute in the API controller (`[Route(""api/[controller]"")]`). Also, ensure that the route is correctly configured in the IIS settings.

3. Check the Content-Type header: Confirm that the `Content-Type` header in the Postman request is set to `application/json`. This header is necessary to correctly interpret the JSON payload in the API.

4. Validate the data binding: Ensure that the `Transaction` model in the API controller is correctly binding the JSON payload to its properties. You can add model validation attributes (e.g., `[Required]`, `[JsonProperty]`) to the properties to enforce data integrity.

5. Verify the AWS Lambda execution: Double-check the Lambda function's execution settings, such as the IAM role permissions, network configuration, and any potential timeouts. Ensure that the Lambda function has the appropriate permissions to invoke the API endpoint and that it is running in the correct network environment.

6. Verify the IIS configuration: Check the IIS configuration to ensure that the API application is correctly deployed and running. Ensure that the API is accessible over HTTPS, and the necessary ports and bindings are properly configured.

7. Enable detailed error logging: Enable detailed error logging in the API to capture any potential exceptions that might occur during the processing of the request. You can add logging statements or use a logging framework like Serilog to log any errors or exceptions.

By investigating these areas, you should be able to pinpoint the issue and resolve the problem with the .NET Core Web API not receiving JSON from the Mock Lambda Tool, Postman, and Swagger.",0.5680902004241943,"c#, json, api, iis, aws-lambda",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I've tried using surface color from colors like:
Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surface

but it appears to be the same color as
Theme.of(context).colorScheme.background

","You can wrap your text_form_field widget with Card widget and give it elevation as well as boxShadow. It will work for you.
Card(
        child: //Your_text_form_field,
      elevation: 10,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        boxShadow: [
          new BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.red,
            blurRadius: 20.0,
          ),
        ],
      ),

","In Flutter's Material Design, the concept of elevation is used to create a layered and hierarchical visual representation of UI elements. Elevation is typically applied to widgets like Card, NavigationBar, and FloatingActionButton to give them a raised appearance.

To achieve the same elevated effect for a TextField widget, you can wrap it inside a Card widget. The Card widget provides built-in elevation and shadow effects. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```dart
Card(
  elevation: 4, // Adjust the elevation value as per your preference
  child: TextField(
    // TextField properties and styling
  ),
)
```

By wrapping the TextField with a Card, you will get the desired elevated appearance.

Regarding the elevation colors in Material Design 3 (You), the surface color and background color are indeed the same by default. However, you can customize them to have different colors if needed.

To customize the surface color, you can define a custom theme in your Flutter app and override the color scheme. Here's an example:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.light(
      surface: Colors.blue, // Customize the surface color here
    ),
  ),
  home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

By setting a different color for the surface property in the color scheme, you can change the elevation color for widgets like Card or NavigationBar.

Remember to replace `MyHomePage` with the appropriate widget in your code.

I hope this helps you fix the issue and achieve the desired elevated appearance for your TextField widget in Flutter with Material Design.",0.7003138065338135,"flutter, material-design",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

In the POST request handling, we assign the selected employee to the document before saving it. This ensures that the document is associated with the correct employee.

Make sure to replace `Employee` with the name of your employee model and `employee_id` with the actual field name that represents the employee id in the POST data.

    }

","To return the value from a callback in Kotlin, you can make use of a callback interface or use a callback with a lambda expression. Here's how you can modify the code to send the result to the ViewModel:

1. Define a callback interface that the ViewModel can implement:

```kotlin
interface SignInCallback {
    fun onSuccess(token: OAuthToken)
    fun onError(error: Throwable)
}
```

2. Modify the callback definition to accept the callback interface as a parameter:

```kotlin
val callback: SignInCallback = object : SignInCallback {
    override fun onSuccess(token: OAuthToken) {
        // TODO: success return to ViewModel
    }

    override fun onError(error: Throwable) {
        // TODO: error return to ViewModel
    }
}
```

3. Update the `signInWithABC` function to accept the ViewModel as a parameter and invoke the appropriate callback method:

```kotlin
fun signInWithABC(viewModel: SignInCallback) {
    abcApi.signIn(callback = object : SignInCallback {
        override fun onSuccess(token: OAuthToken) {
            viewModel.onSuccess(token)
        }

        override fun onError(error: Throwable) {
            viewModel.onError(error)
        }
    })
}
```

Now, you can call the `signInWithABC` function from your ViewModel by passing itself as an argument:

```kotlin
signInWithABC(this)
```

This way, the result will be sent to the ViewModel through the callback interface's methods.

Note: Make sure your ViewModel implements the `SignInCallback` interface and provides the necessary implementations for the `onSuccess` and `onError` methods.",0.34453755617141724,"android, kotlin, callback",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74354445,What does the FC field represent in the MIPS machine code for floating point compare instructions? Refer to figure below,"
Can you also tell me how to assembler behaves for values of FC=00,01,10 and 11.
When I execute the instruction on my assembler - I found FC=11. But I have no idea what it means.
","The 2-bit fc field and the following 4 bits, both together, are really just the 6-bit func field.
I don't know why those authors choose break this apart into two side-by-side fields as it seems to serve no particular purpose that I can see.
Further, while they break the func field in two just for those several instructions, they revert to depiction of a 6-bit func field for all other instruction descriptions.
Because of this notation, in looking for an fc field of 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, with the subsequent 4 bits being 0xc, we can also look for func field values of 0x0c, 0x1c, 0x2c, and 0x3c, some of which can be found.
A func value of 0x3c is for c.lt.s/d (with the proper opcode=0x11 and fmt=0x10/0x11 for single vs. double, of course).
A func field value of 0x0c is for round.w.s/d.
The other values, 0x1c &amp; 0x2c are not to be found in the documentation, and this sort of omission is typical of unused opcodes, so one possibility is then that these are indeed unused opcodes for the R2000.
Entering 46 00 00 3c into https://disasm.pro/ (MIPS/big-endian) yields the proper c.lt.s, and 46 00 00 0c yields the expected round.w.s, whereas ending in 1c or 2c yield no disassembly.
Another source, MIPS green sheet, offers the same answers: 0x0c is for round and 0x3c for compare, while 0x1c and 0x2c are shown as unassigned.

What would we expect the processor to do with unassigned opcodes?  It is unclear and typically unspecified in great detail.  It takes work to detect these things so designers may allow the implementation to do what is most convenient (i.e. lowest hardware effort).  Thus, unspecified can be by omission or maybe even by explicitly being defined as undefined behavior!  Possibilities for execution range from causing some kind of exception/fault (unimplemented), to decoding the instruction improperly, which might mean running an instruction of very similar encoding.
","To fix the problem, we need to understand what the FC field represents in the MIPS machine code for floating point compare instructions.

In MIPS assembly language, floating point compare instructions are used to compare two floating point values. The FC field, also known as the FPU Condition field, is a 2-bit field in the machine code instruction that specifies the type of comparison to be performed.

The FC field has four possible values: 00, 01, 10, and 11. Each value represents a different type of comparison operation.

Here's how the assembler behaves for each value of the FC field:

1. FC = 00: This value indicates an unordered or unordered or false condition. It is typically used for unordered comparisons or when the result of the comparison is false.

2. FC = 01: This value indicates an ordered or true condition. It is typically used for ordered comparisons or when the result of the comparison is true.

3. FC = 10: This value indicates a less than condition. It is used when the first operand is less than the second operand.

4. FC = 11: This value indicates a less than or equal to condition. It is used when the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand.

In your case, when you execute the instruction and find that FC = 11, it means that the comparison operation being performed is a less than or equal to condition.

To understand the specific behavior of the assembler for the FC field values in your case, you may need to refer to the documentation or user manual of your assembler or the specific MIPS implementation you are using.",0.6096988916397095,"assembly, mips, machine-code, mips32, mars-simulator",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

i have tried to insert two counts but i am getting error. how could we create two jobs with one job. like one job needs to create with first dbname and first script location as showed below.
job1--&gt; sql_db_job - s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job.py
job2--&gt; sql_db_job2 - s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job2.py

any responses would be appreciated. thank you.
","Based on the variables and code you have provided, you would have to change count so it uses the length of one of the lists. For example:
resource &quot;aws_glue_job&quot; &quot;etl_jobs&quot; {
  count    = var.created_GL ? length(var.db2jobnames) : 0
  name     = &quot;${var.db2jobnames[count.index]}_db2etljobs&quot;
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.glue_role.arn

    python_version  = var.python_version
    script_location = var.script_location[count.index]
  }

","To create multiple glue jobs as one job in Terraform, you can use the `for_each` loop instead of `count`. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

1. In your `variable.tf` file, update the variable definitions to use `map` type instead of `list`:

```terraform
variable ""db2jobnames"" {
  description = ""db2 glue job names""
  type        = map
  default     = {
    ""sql_db_job""  = ""s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job.py""
    ""sql_db_job2"" = ""s3://s3_buget/sql_db_job2.py""
  }
}
```

2. In your `main.tf` file, update the resource block for `aws_glue_job`:

```terraform
resource ""aws_glue_job"" ""etl_jobs"" {
  for_each = var.db2jobnames

  name     = ""${each.key}_db2etljobs""
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.glue_role.arn

  command {
    python_version  = var.python_version
    script_location = each.value
  }

  default_arguments = {
    ""--extra-jars""                       = var.JarDir
    ""--TempDir""                          = var.TempDir
    ""--class""                            = ""GlueApp""
    ""--enable-continuous-cloudwatch-log"" = var.enable-continuous-cloudwatch_log
    ""--enable-glue-datacatalog""          = var.enable-glue-datacatalog
    ""--enable-metrics""                   = var.enable-metrics
    ""--enable-spark-ui""                  = var.enable-spark-ui
    ""--job-bookmark-option""              = var.job-bookmark-option
    ""--job-language""                     = ""python""
    ""--env""                              = var.paramregion
    ""--spark-event-logs-path""            = var.sparkeventlogpath
  }

  execution_property {
    max_concurrent_runs = var.max_concurrent_runs
  }

  connections = [
    aws_glue_connection.conn_db2.name

  glue_version      = var.glue_version
  max_retries       = 0
  worker_type       = var.worker_type
  number_of_workers = 20
  timeout           = 2880
  tags              = local.common_tags
}
```

With these modifications, you can create multiple glue jobs using the `db2jobnames` variable, where each key-value pair represents the job name and script location. The `for_each` loop will iterate over each key-value pair and create separate glue jobs for each.",0.7559125423431396,"amazon-web-services, terraform, aws-glue, terraform-provider-aws",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73525303,Setting value for each item in for loop to true or false,"I am trying to create a v-for that shows a list of exercises containing several sets. I have created a loop with a row for each set underneath each exercise.
my data looks like this.
const exercises = [ 
{ id: 1, name: exercise1, sets: 3 },
{ id:2, name: exercise2, sets: 2 } 
{ id:3, name: exercise3, sets: 4 } 
]

And my component looks something like this:
 &lt;template v-for=&quot;exercise in exercises&quot; :key=&quot;exercise.id&quot;&gt;
   &lt;span&gt; {{ exercise.name }} &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;template v-for=&quot;set in exercise.sets&quot; :key=&quot;set&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span @click=&quot;completeSet()&quot;&gt; {{ set }} &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;

Now I want to be able to mark each set as completed by setting the value on each set to either true or false through a click event. But I am not sure about how to do this since each set doesn't have a property to set a value because it's looping through a number.
What would be the right approach to this problem?
","You can create array with finished sets and compare it (try the snippet pls):


new Vue({
  el: ""#demo"",
  data() {
    return {
      exercises: [{ id: 1, name: 'exercise1', sets: 3 }, { id: 2, name: 'exercise2', sets: 2 }, { id: 3, name: 'exercise3', sets: 4 }],
      finishedSets: []
    }
  },
  computed: {
    checkAll() {
      return this.exercises.reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr.sets, 0) === this.finishedSets.length
    }
  },
  methods: {
    compareObjects(o1, o2) {
      return Object.entries(o1).sort().toString() !== Object.entries(o2).sort().toString()
    },
    findObject(id, set) {
      return this.finishedSets.find(f =&gt; f.id === id &amp;&amp; f.set === set)
    },
    completeSet(id, set) {
      this.findObject(id, set) ? 
        this.finishedSets = this.finishedSets.filter(f =&gt; {return this.compareObjects(f, this.findObject(id, set))}) :
        this.finishedSets.push({id, set})
    },
    isFinished(id, set) {
      return this.findObject(id, set) ? true : false
    },
  }
})
.set {
  width: 70px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.finished {
  background-color: seagreen;
}
.finished__not {
  background-color: tomato;
}

  &lt;div v-for=""exercise in exercises"" :key=""exercise.id""&gt;
   &lt;span&gt; {{ exercise.name }} &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div v-for=""set in exercise.sets"" :key=""set""&gt;
      &lt;div @click=""completeSet(exercise.id, set)"" class=""set"" :class=""isFinished(exercise.id, set) ? 'finished' : 'finished__not'""&gt; {{ set }} &lt;span&gt;
      &lt;span v-if=""isFinished(exercise.id, set)""&gt;finished&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button v-if=""checkAll""&gt;submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;{{finishedSets}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



","To fix the problem, you can modify your data structure to include an array of objects for each exercise's sets. Each object in the array can have a `completed` property to track the completion status of the set. Here's an updated version of your data:

```javascript
const exercises = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'exercise1',
    sets: [
      { id: 1, completed: false },
      { id: 2, completed: false },
      { id: 3, completed: false }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'exercise2',
    sets: [
      { id: 1, completed: false },
      { id: 2, completed: false }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'exercise3',
    sets: [
      { id: 1, completed: false },
      { id: 2, completed: false },
      { id: 3, completed: false },
      { id: 4, completed: false }
    ]
  }
];
```

Now, you can update your component to toggle the `completed` property for each set when clicked. Here's the modified component:

```html
<template v-for=""exercise in exercises"" :key=""exercise.id"">
  <span>{{ exercise.name }}</span>
  <template v-for=""set in exercise.sets"" :key=""set.id"">
    <span @click=""completeSet(exercise, set)"">{{ set.id }}</span>
  </template>
</template>
```

In the `completeSet` method, you can update the `completed` property of the clicked set:

```javascript
methods: {
  completeSet(exercise, set) {
    set.completed = !set.completed;
  }
}
```

With this approach, you can toggle the completion status of each set individually by clicking on it.",0.6713765859603882,"javascript, vue.js, vuejs3, v-for",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

        z-index: -1;
      }
    }
  }
}

Here a working example. Have you any suggestion to have a better solution with almost the same result?
","You could add an extra div inside your wrapper and use a linear gradient on it:


.wrapper {
  background: lightgray;

.background {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, green, green 50%, orange 50%, orange 100%);

      &lt;section class=""column right""&gt;RIGHT&lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



","To achieve the desired result of having two side-by-side boxes with a full-width background but limited text content, you can make the following modifications to your CSS:

1. Remove the `overflow: hidden;` property from the `.wrapper` class. This will allow the background to extend beyond the container.

2. Change the `max-width` property of the `.container` class to `100%` instead of `900px`. This will make the container span the full width of the page.

3. Modify the `position` property of the `section` elements to `relative` instead of `isolation: isolate;`. This will ensure that the absolute-positioned pseudo-elements are positioned correctly.

4. Update the `width` property of the `:before` pseudo-elements to `100%` instead of `500%`. This will make the background cover the entire width of the container.

Here's the updated CSS code:

```css
.wrapper {
  background: lightgray;
  padding: 10px;
}

.container {
  border: dotted 1px red;
  display: flex;
  max-width: 100%;
  margin: 0 auto;

      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
      z-index: -1;

","Thank you, @shawnt00:
CROSS JOIN is a simpler join for this scenario.
Another solution I've found since asking is
LEFT JOIN ON true

","In the given query, you are trying to join two unrelated single-row/value results using a common column ""joint"". While this approach may work, it is not a standard or recommended way to join unrelated single-row/value results.

A better approach would be to use subqueries or CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to retrieve the single-row/value results separately and then combine them using a cross join or a Cartesian product. Here's an example of how you can modify your query:

WITH values_result AS (
    SELECT SUM(value) AS values 
    FROM table_one 
    WHERE condition
),
fee_result AS (
    SELECT fee 
    FROM table_two 
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT 
    values_result.values, fee_result.fee, values_result.values + fee_result.fee AS total 
FROM
    values_result
CROSS JOIN
    fee_result;

In this modified query, the subqueries ""values_result"" and ""fee_result"" retrieve the single-row/value results separately. Then, a cross join is performed to combine the results, resulting in a Cartesian product. Finally, the total is calculated as the sum of the values and the fee.

This approach is more standard and easier to understand compared to joining unrelated single-row/value results using a common column. It also avoids any potential issues that may arise from the join condition.",0.4587784707546234,"sql, postgresql",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To fix the problem and recode NA in column i2 when i1 is NA, you can modify your code as follows:

```R
df <- data.frame(id = c(1,2,3),
                 i1 = c(1,NA,0),
                 i2 = c(1,1,1))

df %>% 
  mutate(i2 = ifelse(is.na(i1), NA, i2))
```

This will replace the NA values in column i2 with NA when the corresponding value in column i1 is also NA.

The output will be:
```
  id i1 i2
1  1  1  1
2  2 NA NA
3  3  0  1
```

In this code, the `ifelse()` function is used to check if i1 is NA. If it is, then the value of i2 is set to NA, otherwise, it remains unchanged.",0.7490152716636658,"r, recode",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I want to link ./asio-1.24.0/include   with my project using CMAKE.

Error:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (target_include_directories):
  Cannot specify include directories for target &quot;networking_examples&quot; which
  is not built by this project.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also &quot;D:/Git Repo/c++/networking/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log&quot;.

","When you use target_include_directories there is not target named networking_examples. You add that target after.
Order matters, and just like in C++ symbols must be defined before they can be used.
So you need to change to:
add_executable(
  networking_examples
  ./src/index.cpp
)

# Asio library header directory
target_include_directories(networking_examples PRIVATE &quot;./asio-1.24.0/include&quot;)


On another couple of notes: First you don't seem to be using Boost ASIO but rather the standalone header-only library.
Secondly, you don't link with the library (it's a header-only library). You only tell the build-system where it can find the ASIO header files.
","To fix the error you're encountering when trying to include boost-asio in your CMake project, you need to make a few modifications to your CMakeLists.txt file. Below is an updated version of your CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(networking_examples)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Set the path to the boost library
set(BOOST_ROOT ""/path/to/boost"")

# Find the boost-asio library
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)

# Include the boost headers
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(
  networking_examples
  ./src/index.cpp
)

# Link against the boost-asio library
target_link_libraries(networking_examples ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/boost` with the actual path to your boost installation directory.

In this updated version, we use `find_package` to locate the boost-asio library. We also use `include_directories` to include the boost headers and `target_link_libraries` to link against the boost-asio library.

By making these changes, you should be able to successfully link boost-asio in your CMake project.",0.8187897801399231,"c++, cmake, boost-asio, static-libraries, cmake-language",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73611112,Is there way to create types like Array in typescript,"Is there a way to create type in typescript with methods that when I call these methods, they have access to the variable's value? Equals what the array, for example, which has the method find.
Example:
const arrayVar: Array = [1,2,3];

array.find(el =&gt; el === 1); 

In this case, find has access to the value of the array arrayVar without me having to pass it via a parameter to a function, for example, I wanted to create something in this way, for example:
const myVar: MyCustomType = 5;

myVar.add(2); // Nesse caso, o retorno seria 7. 

I know it can be done with classes and functions, but then I would have to pass the value of &quot;myVar&quot; as a parameter (function add (value1, value2), for example), I wanted a way to access it directly, just like the type Array does in its methods.
","To make a subclass of Number with new methods:
class SwagNumber extends Number {
  add(number: number) {
    // Tell the TS compiler that `this` is an unboxed Number
    return (this as unknown as number) + number;
  }
}

Then to use:
const six = new SwagNumber(6);

six will be typed to SwagNumber by the TS compiler.
And to show it works:
six.add(5)
&gt; 11

Let's look at the Constructor used, part of the Class:
&gt; six.constructor
[class SwagNumber extends Number]

This will also leave the original Number prototype unchanged, which will stop any potential issues (double dots are used to use a method on a number, to distinguish the dot from a decimal point!)
&gt; 3..constructor
[Function: Number]

or:
&gt; (3).constructor
[Function: Number]

See Classes on MDN
However there's some danger here
Since SwagNumber is an object, and a regular number isn't an object by default (until you call its methods), comparisons won't work properly:
&gt; six === 6
false

See Why should you not use Number as a constructor?
","Yes, in TypeScript, you can create custom types with methods that have access to the variable's value. One way to achieve this is by using classes and defining methods on the class prototype.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom type with methods that can access the variable's value directly:

```typescript
class MyCustomType {
  constructor(private value: number) {}

  add(num: number): number {
    return this.value + num;
  }
}

const myVar = new MyCustomType(5);
console.log(myVar.add(2)); // Output: 7
```

In the example above, we define a class `MyCustomType` with a constructor that takes a number and assigns it to the private `value` property. We then define a method `add` that adds the given number to the `value` property and returns the result.

By instantiating `MyCustomType` with `new MyCustomType(5)`, we create an instance of the class with an initial value of 5. We can then call the `add` method on `myVar` instance, and it will access the `value` property directly without needing to pass it as a parameter.

This approach allows you to create custom types with methods that have access to the instance's internal state, similar to how built-in types like `Array` provide methods like `find` that can access the array's elements without explicitly passing them as parameters.",0.5649522542953491,"javascript, typescript, types",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To fix the problem of sorting items by date and adding numbers from today, you can make the following modifications to your code:

1. Sorting Items by Date:
   - In your `ItemViewModel` class, add a computed property called `sortedItemList` that returns the `ItemList` sorted by date in descending order.
   - Replace the `List` in your `ContentView` with `ForEach` and iterate over `VM.sortedItemList` instead of `VM.ItemList`.

Here's the modified code:

```swift
struct Item: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var int: Int
    var date = Date()
}

              let savedItems = try? JSONDecoder().decode([Item].self, from: data) else {
            ItemList = []
            return

            print(error)
        }

        VM.ItemList.append(Item(name: name, int: int))
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

2. Adding Numbers from Today:
   - In your `ContentView` view, create a function called `updateTotalNumber()` that calculates the sum of `int` values for items with a date equal to today's date.
   - Call `updateTotalNumber()` after adding an item in the `addItem()` function.

Here's the modified code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    // ...
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 30) {
            // ...
        }
        .onAppear {
            updateTotalNumber()
        }
    }
    
    // ...
    
    func addItem() {
        VM.ItemList.append(Item(name: name, int: int))
        updateTotalNumber()
    }
    
    func updateTotalNumber() {
        let today = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
        totalNumber = VM.ItemList.filter { Calendar.current.isDate($0.date, inSameDayAs: today) }
            .map { $0.int }
            .reduce(0, +)
    }
}
```

With these modifications, your items will be sorted by date in descending order, and the `totalNumber` will be updated based on the sum of `int` values for items with today's date.",0.7739859819412231,"ios, swiftui",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

1. Create an empty dataframe to store the final result:

```

2. Iterate over each column in the `dfdata` dataframe (except the first column ""id""):
```R
for (col in names(dfdata)[-1]) {
```

3. Check if the column name exists in the `dfcheck` dataframe:
```R
  if (col %in% names(dfcheck)) {
```

4. Split the values in the corresponding column of `dfcheck` by "";"" to get multiple options:
```R
    options <- strsplit(as.character(dfcheck[[col]]), "";"")
```

5. Create new columns in the `dfresult` dataframe based on the number of options:
```R
    for (i in 1:length(options)) {
      dfresult[paste0(col, i)] <- NA
    }
```

6. Iterate over each row in the `dfdata` dataframe:
```R
    for (row in 1:nrow(dfdata)) {
```

7. Iterate over each option in the current column:
```R
      for (i in 1:length(options)) {
```

8. Check if the value in the `dfdata` dataframe matches any of the options:
```R
        if (!is.na(dfdata[row, col]) && dfdata[row, col] %in% options[[i]]) {
```

9. Assign the corresponding values from `dfcheck` to the new columns in `dfresult`:
```R
          dfresult[row, paste0(col, i)] <- dfcheck$status[which(dfcheck[[col]] == dfdata[row, col])]
          dfresult[row, paste0(""stock"", i)] <- dfcheck$stock[which(dfcheck[[col]] == dfdata[row, col])]

The component can then listen to that and call StateHasChanged() to re-render the page.
This works but I have a couple of questions about the method.

Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default? Either for the event based communication or the whole AppState service. I'd imagine this is quite a common problem and perhaps I'm missing some default functionality like @bind.

Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable? I understand why
it needs to be disposed of, but why don't we need to do it when, for
instance, binding some data to an input field to essentially do the
same thing? Does the @bind attribute already handle that under the hood?


Thanks in advance and sorry if I'm missing something obvious, still learning the ropes of Blazor.
","
Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default?

For Communication between unrelated components, we have different options:

AppState registered as Scoped/Singleton. (extra overhead of registering and disposing event).
AppState as razor file (code example is given below).
Follow MVVM pattern for storing state, but there is downside to this approach we need to inject every view model as Scoped/Singleton. (If we are re using same component multiple times then each component state will be same).

Based on the requirement you can choose the best.
Example for AppState as razor file (preserving state of counter)
App.razor will look like this:
&lt;AppState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly=&quot;@typeof(App).Assembly&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Found Context=&quot;routeData&quot;&gt;
            &lt;RouteView RouteData=&quot;@routeData&quot; DefaultLayout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;FocusOnNavigate RouteData=&quot;@routeData&quot; Selector=&quot;h1&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;PageTitle&gt;Not found&lt;/PageTitle&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/AppState&gt;

and AppState.razor will look like this:
&lt;CascadingValue Value=&quot;this&quot;&gt;
    @ChildContent
&lt;/CascadingValue&gt;

@code {
    private int _count;

    [Parameter]
    public required RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }//use 'required' only if .net version is 7 &amp; above

    public int Count
    {
        get =&gt; _count; 
        set
        {
            _count = value;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }
}

and Counter.razor will look like this:
@page &quot;/counter&quot;

&lt;PageTitle&gt;Counter&lt;/PageTitle&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Counter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p role=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Current count: @State.Count&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; @onclick=&quot;IncrementCount&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    public required AppState State { get; set; }//use 'required' only if .net version is 7 &amp; above

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        State.Count++;
    }
}


Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable?

No, only an extra overhead, we need to dispose all unmanged resource manually.
","To achieve communication between an injected class service (AppState) and components in Blazor, you can use the event-based approach as described in the blog post you mentioned. This approach is commonly used and works well for scenarios where you need to notify components about changes in the shared state.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate ways implemented into the language by default?

The event-based approach is a good way to handle communication between components and a shared service. Blazor doesn't provide any built-in mechanism specifically for this scenario, so using events is a common and effective solution. However, you can also explore other patterns like using a StateContainer or a reactive programming library like Rx.NET if they better fit your requirements.

2. Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable?

Implementing IDisposable in a component is necessary when you need to manually clean up resources or unsubscribe from events. In the case of the AppState service, it's important to unsubscribe from the event when the component is disposed to avoid memory leaks. The @implements IDisposable directive ensures that the Dispose method of the component is called when it is no longer needed.

Binding data to an input field using @bind attribute does handle the disposal of resources under the hood. When the component is disposed, the framework automatically unbinds the input field and cleans up any associated resources.

In summary, the event-based approach for communication between components and a shared service is a common and effective solution in Blazor. Implementing IDisposable in a component is necessary when manual resource cleanup or event unsubscription is required. The @bind attribute handles disposal automatically when binding data to input fields.",0.5996477007865906,"asp.net-core, blazor",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

)  

Is this what you are looking for or are you trying to remove several entries whenever the total exceeds 480 via some sort of script or validation before it's created. If so, I need to see more code to understand where this array comes from.
----EDITED AFTER FURTHER INFO PROVIDED ------
So it sounds like you are getting two arrays from a database and then merging them. Is this what you are doing?
$arrayOne = array(

    0 =&gt;
    array(
        'user_code' =&gt; '073',
        'name' =&gt; 'Ashish',
        'email' =&gt; 'ashishm@gmail.com',

        'name' =&gt; 'Tyler',
        'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',
    ),
);

$arrayTwo = array(
    0 =&gt;
    array(
        'user_code' =&gt; '073',
        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-04',
        'total' =&gt; '915',
    ),
    1 =&gt;
    array(
        'user_code' =&gt; '073',
        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-05',
        'total' =&gt; 0,
    ),
    2 =&gt;
    array(
        'user_code' =&gt; '073',
        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-06',
        'total' =&gt; '360',
    ),
    4 =&gt;
    array(

        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-04',
        'total' =&gt; '805',

        'date' =&gt; '2022-07-04',
        'total' =&gt; '10000',
    ),
);

$mergedArray = array_merge($arrayOne, $arrayTwo);


If so, array_filter should work. @Bruce solution was close but it was not testing the value below 480.

$filteredArray = array_filter($mergedArray, function ($val) {
    if (!isset($val['total'])) return true;
    if ($val['total'] &lt; 480) return true;
    return false;
});



","To remove the array elements that have a total greater than 480 from the given array in Laravel, you can use the following code:

```php
$array = [
    [
        'user_code' => '073',
        'name' => 'Ashish',
        'email' => 'ashishm@gmail.com',
    ],
    [
        'user_code' => '073',
        'date' => '2022-07-04',
        'total' => '915',
    ],
    [
        'user_code' => '073',
        'date' => '2022-07-05',
        'total' => 0,
    ],
    [
        'user_code' => '073',
        'date' => '2022-07-06',
        'total' => '360',
    ],
];

$newArray = array_filter($array, function ($item) {
    return empty($item['total']) || $item['total'] <= 480;
});

```

In the above code, we use the `array_filter()` function to iterate over each element of the array and apply a callback function. The callback function checks if the 'total' key is empty or its value is less than or equal to 480. If the condition is true, the element is kept in the resulting array, otherwise, it is filtered out.

After running the code, the `$newArray` will contain the filtered array with the elements having a total less than or equal to 480.",0.7806692719459534,"php, arrays, laravel",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74438621,How to export Azure Prices REST API to CSV,"I would like to save the whole Azure Prices REST API to CSV.

and saves data.csv (screenshot from LibreOffice):

","The issue with your script is that you are not calling the `GetJSON` function recursively to iterate through all the pages.

To fix this, you need to modify your script to include a loop that continues until there is no more `NextPageLink` available. Here's an updated version of your script that should export the entire Azure Prices REST API to CSV:

```python
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
from timeit import default_timer as timer
from datetime import timedelta

start = timer()
NextPageLink = ""https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices""

def GetJSON(NextPageLink):
    while NextPageLink:
        wjdata = requests.get(NextPageLink).json()
        df = pd.DataFrame(wjdata)
        df.to_csv(""test.csv"", mode='a', index=False, header=not os.path.isfile(""test.csv""))
        if 'NextPageLink' in wjdata:
            print(timer(), wjdata['NextPageLink'])
            NextPageLink = wjdata['NextPageLink']
        else:
            NextPageLink = None

GetJSON(NextPageLink)
```

In the updated script, the `while` loop continues until there is no more `NextPageLink`. Inside the loop, the JSON response is fetched using `requests.get` and converted into a DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame`. The DataFrame is then appended to the CSV file using `to_csv` with `mode='a'` (append mode), and `header=not os.path.isfile(""test.csv"")` ensures that the header is written only once.

By making these modifications, your script will now iterate through all the pages and export the entire Azure Prices REST API to the CSV file.",0.8008103370666504,"python, json, pandas, rest, web-scraping",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Jackson ObjectMapper cannot create the object, because neither default constructor exists nor any other creator is provided (e.g. @JsonCreator, @ConstructorProperties).
You also have a rate property that is not defined in the Film class, which will cause problems unless you use the @JsonIgnoreProperties annotation (possibly with ignoreUnknown attribute set to true) or configure the ObjectMapper globally (DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES). It could also be that you wanted the likes property to handle that - anyway, it should be fixed.
I've also stumbled upon lack of the jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency, but maybe your project already has it (it's required for the Java 8 classes like LocalDate).

There are different ways to solve the first problem described above, but generally you need to either provide a default constructor or define a creator for Jackson.
If you don't want to expose the default constructor, you can change the settings of the ObjectMapper (for Spring Boot read about Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder) to allow usage of private creators (setVisibility method). In Lombok there's an annotation: @NoArgsConstructor. To limit the visibility, use the access annotation attribute.
The creator can be handled by annotating the constructor with ordered argument names:
@ConstructorProperties({&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;description&quot;, &quot;releaseDate&quot;, &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;genres&quot;, &quot;mpa&quot;, &quot;likes&quot;}). It gets complicated with the Genre and Rating classes as you do not have an explicit access to their constructors. You could either create them and mark appropriately or create a lombok.config file in your project's root directory and inside the file define the property:
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties = true
This way Lombok will automatically add the @ConstructorProperties annotations to the classes.

I've created a GitHub repository with the tests for the solution - you can find it here. The lombok.config file is also included, as well as the fixed Film class.
","To properly handle the serialization of the ""mpa"" and ""genres"" fields in your Film class, you need to provide custom serializers for these classes.

First, you need to annotate the ""mpa"" and ""genres"" fields in the Film class with the `@JsonSerialize` annotation, specifying the custom serializers for each field.

```java
@JsonSerialize(using = RatingSerializer.class)
private Rating mpa;

@JsonSerialize(using = GenreListSerializer.class)
private List<Genre> genres;
```

Next, you need to create the custom serializers for the Rating and Genre classes.

```java
public class RatingSerializer extends JsonSerializer<Rating> {

    @Override
    public void serialize(Rating rating, JsonGenerator jsonGenerator, SerializerProvider serializerProvider) throws IOException {
        jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
        jsonGenerator.writeNumberField(""id"", rating.getId());
        jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
    }
}

public class GenreListSerializer extends JsonSerializer<List<Genre>> {

    @Override
    public void serialize(List<Genre> genres, JsonGenerator jsonGenerator, SerializerProvider serializerProvider) throws IOException {
        jsonGenerator.writeStartArray();
        for (Genre genre : genres) {
            jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
            jsonGenerator.writeNumberField(""id"", genre.getId());
            jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
        }
        jsonGenerator.writeEndArray();
    }
}
```

In the RatingSerializer, we override the serialize method to write the ""id"" field of the Rating object as a number. Similarly, in the GenreListSerializer, we override the serialize method to write the ""id"" field of each Genre object in the list.

By providing these custom serializers, Spring Boot will use them to properly serialize the ""mpa"" and ""genres"" fields in the JSON request body.

Note: Make sure to import the necessary classes, such as `JsonSerializer`, `JsonGenerator`, `SerializerProvider`, and `IOException`.",0.5470371842384338,"java, spring-boot",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","You have packages that are way out of date. You need to 1) update your packages and 2) go back to the firebase documentation for flutter and follow the suggested steps since you are also missing firebase_core which is needed to use firebase_auth and cloud_firestore in your project.
","The error message suggests that there is an issue with resolving the dependencies for the `processDebugResources` task in your Gradle build. Specifically, it is unable to resolve the `com.google.android.gms:play-services-measurement-base:[21.1.1]` dependency.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your internet connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to download the required dependencies.

2. Clean and rebuild the project: Run the following command in your project directory to clean and rebuild the project:

   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

   This will clean any previously downloaded dependencies and fetch the necessary ones again.

3. Update Gradle and Flutter versions: Update your Gradle and Flutter versions to the latest stable versions. You can do this by modifying the `build.gradle` file in your project's `android` directory. Change the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` dependency to the latest version available. For example, you can change it to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'`.

4. Update the Google Services Gradle plugin: Update the `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services'` dependency in your `build.gradle` file to the latest version. For example, you can change it to `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'`.

5. Check your firewall or proxy settings: If you are behind a firewall or using a proxy, make sure that the necessary ports and URLs are accessible for Gradle to download the required dependencies.

6. Disable offline mode: In your Android Studio, go to Preferences > Gradle and uncheck the ""Offline work"" option. This will ensure that Gradle can fetch dependencies from the internet.

7. Retry after some time: Sometimes, the server hosting the required dependencies may be temporarily unavailable. In such cases, waiting for some time and then retrying the build may resolve the issue.

If none of the above steps solve the issue, you can try removing the `image_picker` dependency temporarily and see if the build succeeds without it. This will help isolate the issue to the specific dependency.

Additionally, the `flutter-doctor` output shows that the Flutter plugin and Dart plugin are not installed in your Android Studio. You can install them by going to Preferences > Plugins in Android Studio and searching for ""Flutter"" and ""Dart"" plugins. Install and enable them to get Flutter and Dart-specific functionality in Android Studio.

Remember to run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` after making any changes to your dependencies or Gradle files.

I hope these steps help you resolve the issue with the Gradle build and fix the ""Bad Gateway"" error.",0.5969750881195068,"flutter, gradle, build.gradle, pubspec, flutter-doctor",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73211933,Extending short key for AES256 (SNMPv3),"I am currently working on security of a switch that runs SNMPv3.
I am expected to code it in such a way, that any SHA (1 - 2-512) is compatible with any AES (128 - 256C).
Everything, like the algorithms alone, works pretty well. The problem is, that its been estabilished, that we are going to use SHA for key generation for both authentification and encryption.
When I want to use, let's say, SHA512 with AES256, there's no problem, since SHA has output of 64B and I need just 32B for key for AES256.
But when I want to use SHA1 with AES256, SHA1 produces only 20B, which is insufficient for the key.
I've searched the internet through and through and I found out, that it's common to use this combination (snmpget, openssl), but I havent found a single word about how are you supposed to prolong the key.
How can I extend the key from 20B to 32B so it works?
P. S.: Yes, I know SHA isn't KDF, yes, I know it's not that common to use this combination, but this is just how it is in my job assignment.
","Here is a page discussing your exact question. In short, there is no standard way to do this (as you have already discovered), however, Cisco has adopted the approach outlined in section 2.1 of this document:

Chaining is described as follows.  First, run the password-to-key algorithm with inputs of the passphrase and engineID as described in the USM document.  This will output as many key bits as the hash algorithm used to implement the password-to-key algorithm.  Secondly, run the password-to-key algorithm again with the previous output (instead of the passphrase) and the same engineID as inputs.  Repeat this process as many times as necessary in order to generate the minimum number of key bits for the chosen privacy protocol.  The outputs of each execution are concatenated into a single string of key bits.
When this process results in more key bits than are necessary, only the most significant bits of the string should be used.
For example, if password-to-key implemented with SHA creates a 40-octet string string for use as key bits, only the first 32 octets will be used for usm3DESEDEPrivProtocol.

","In order to fix the problem of extending a short key for AES256 when using SHA1, you can use a key derivation function (KDF) to generate a longer key from the SHA1 output.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Obtain the 20-byte SHA1 output as the initial key.
2. Use a KDF, such as HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function), to expand the key to the desired length of 32 bytes.
3. HKDF takes the initial key as input, along with a salt value (which can be a random value or a constant), and optionally, additional context information.
4. Apply the HKDF algorithm to derive a longer key. HKDF uses a pseudorandom function (PRF), such as HMAC, to generate a secure and longer key.
5. Specify the desired output length as 32 bytes (256 bits) for AES256.
6. The HKDF algorithm will generate a longer key that can be used for AES256 encryption.

By using a KDF like HKDF, you can effectively extend the 20-byte SHA1 output to the required 32-byte key for AES256 encryption.

It's important to note that while this approach can extend the key size, it does not increase the security of SHA1 itself. SHA1 is considered to be insecure for certain applications, and it is generally recommended to use stronger hash functions like SHA256 or SHA512. However, if you are specifically required to use SHA1, this method can help you achieve the desired key length for AES256 encryption.",0.28239282965660095,"encryption, aes, snmp, sha",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To remove words from a string based on a list in Google Sheets, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the Google Sheets document provided in the link.
2. Go to the ""Sheet1"" tab where the data is located.
3. In cell E2, enter the following formula:

   ```=ARRAYFORMULA(REGEXREPLACE(D2,JOIN(""|"",B2:B), """"))```

   This formula uses the `REGEXREPLACE` function to remove words from the string in cell D2 based on the list of words in column B. The `JOIN` function is used to concatenate the words in column B into a regular expression pattern, where the words are separated by a pipe symbol (|).

4. Drag the formula down to apply it to the rest of the cells in column E.

The formula will compare each word in the string (cell D2) against the list of words in column B. If a word matches any word in the list, it will be removed from the string. The result will be displayed in column E.

Please note that this solution assumes that the words in column B do not contain any special characters that may interfere with the regular expression pattern. If there are special characters, you may need to modify the formula to escape those characters using the `REGEXEXTRACT` function.

74132943,spring mockito: when an object containing a list is an argument,"The issue is that the list of ids within the pageRequest object can be in any order. Is there a way to specify that below? The test fails since the pageRequest has a list of ids in a different order than the one specified below. The &quot;when&quot; clause returns null in that case.
PageRequest pageRequest = PageRequest.builder()
                .ids(List.of(serviceId2, serviceId1, serviceId3))
                .build();
 when(client.getServices(eq(pageRequest))).thenAnswer(a -&gt; {.......

","You can implement a custom ArgumentMatcher to define the matching logic and then use argThat with this ArgumentMatcher during stubbing :
@Test
public void test(){
        when(someMock.getSerivce(argThat(pageRequestContainId(List.of(1,4,5,6))))).thenReturn(blablabla);
}

private ArgumentMatcher&lt;PageRequest&gt; pageRequestContainId(List&lt;Integer&gt; ids) {
        return pageReq -&gt; pageReq.ids.containsAll(ids) &amp;&amp; pageReq.ids.size() == ids.size();
}


","To fix the problem of the list of ids in the PageRequest object being in a different order, you can use the `ArgumentMatcher` feature provided by Mockito. This allows you to define custom logic to match the arguments passed to the mocked method.

Here's how you can modify your code to specify that the list of ids can be in any order:

```java
PageRequest pageRequest = PageRequest.builder()
                .ids(argThat(containsInAnyOrder(serviceId1, serviceId2, serviceId3)))
                .build();

when(client.getServices(eq(pageRequest))).thenAnswer(a -> {
    // Your logic here
    return null;
});
```

In the above code, `argThat` is used to define a custom argument matcher. The `containsInAnyOrder` matcher from Hamcrest is used to specify that the list of ids can be in any order.

With this change, the `when` clause will match the `pageRequest` object even if the list of ids is in a different order, and the test should pass.",0.6591094732284546,"java, spring, mockito, spring-test, springmockito",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

**[0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]**

of occupied and unoccupied seats, where 1 indicated occupied and 0 indicated unoccupied, we have return the maximum maximum number of people who can be seated  as long  as there is a gap  of **2 seats **between people.
I trid a sliding window approac but it didnt worked
`
// maxim seats question

// [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]

function cinSeating(array) {
  let seats = 0;

  for (let p1 = 0, p2 = 3; p1, p2 &lt;= array.length; p1++, p2++) {
    if (array[p1] !== array[p2]) {
      seats++;
    }
  }
  return seats;
}

console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]));


`
","Try using dynamic programming to solve this problem.
Basic approach:

Parse through the array one by one recursively
At every point, check if that seat can be filled in or not. At this point, you can take either one of the two options - YES or NO
If YES - increment the total count and call the same function with the next index and incremented count
If YES - call the same function with the next index and existing count
Find out the max between the two calculations and return the answer

Code will look something like this:
function hasAPerson(array, index){
    // Utility function to encapsulate all the checks while checking the next index for possible vacant seat
    if(index &gt;= array.length){
        return false;
    }
    
    else return array[index] === 1;
}

function cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index) {
  let newlyAdded = 0;

  if(index &gt;= array.length){
      return existingNumber;
  }

  if(array[index] === 1){
      return cinSeating(array, existingNumber, index, index + 1);
  }
  
  let excludeCurrentSeat = currentValue = cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index + 1);
  
  let includeCurrentSeat = existingNumber;
  
  //Check if last leftIndex with 1 is beyond index-2
  if(leftIndex &lt; index-2){
      
      let next = index+1;
      let nextToNext = next+1;
      
      //Check if next or next to next index has any 1
      if(!hasAPerson(array, next) &amp;&amp; !hasAPerson(array, nextToNext)){
          includeCurrentSeat = cinSeating(array, existingNumber + 1, index, index+1);
      }
  }
  
  return Math.max(currentValue, includeCurrentSeat);
}

You can call the cinSeating function with the following arguments:

input array

existing number of people (seats already booked) - basically number of 1s in the array

last left index that had 1. When we start we can pass -3 so that left check gets passed

index to process
console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 2, -3, 0));


This is something that I wrote quickly to illustrate my approach. This code can definitely be optimised. Feel free to play around with it
","The approach you have taken with the sliding window is a good start, but there are a few issues with the code that need to be fixed. Here is an updated version of the code that should solve the problem:

```javascript
function cinSeating(array) {
  let seats = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 2; i++) {
    if (array[i] === 0 && array[i + 1] === 0 && array[i + 2] === 0) {
      seats++;
      i += 2; // Skip the next two seats since they are already occupied
    }
  }

  return seats;
}

console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]));
```

In this updated version, we iterate through the array using a `for` loop and check if the current seat and the next two seats are all unoccupied (0). If they are, we increment the `seats` counter and skip the next two seats by incrementing `i` by 2. This ensures that there is a gap of 2 seats between people.

In the provided example `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, the output of the `cinSeating` function will be `2`, indicating that there are two groups of people that can be seated with a gap of 2 seats between them.",0.6977072954177856,"javascript, data-structures",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

",".fetchall() method will return a list of tuples for the table you are querying. In this case, your query deletes the records so it is possibly returning an empty tuple. You need a SELECT query for fetchall() to return any results. If you want to see if the record was successfully deleted, you can run the following after the delete query:
cursor.execute(f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE code=&quot;{item}&quot;')
check_code = cursor.fetchall()

If this doesn't return anything, then you know that the record was deleted.
","The error you are encountering is due to an IndexError, specifically ""tuple index out of range"". This error occurs when you are trying to access an index that does not exist in a tuple.

In your code, the line that is causing the issue is `if check_code[0][0] == item:`. This line assumes that `check_code` has at least one element and that the first element has at least one sub-element. However, if `check_code` is empty, or if the first element does not have any sub-elements, this line will raise an IndexError.

To fix this issue, you need to add some error handling and validation to ensure that `check_code` is not empty and that it has the expected structure. Here's an updated version of your code with the necessary changes:

```python
@dp.message_handler(state=dataBase.user1)
async def user_code(message: types.Message, state: FSMContext):
    item = message.text
    await state.update_data({'item': item})

    data = await state.get_data()
    item = data.get('item')

    if len(item) == 0:
        return

    cursor.execute(f'DELETE FROM users WHERE code=""{item}""')
    check_code = cursor.fetchall()

    if len(check_code) > 0 and len(check_code[0]) > 0 and check_code[0][0] == item:
        await bot.send_message(message.from_user.id, ""The user has been successfully deleted!"")
    else:
        await bot.send_message(message.from_user.id, ""There is no such user!"")

    await state.finish()
```

In the updated code, I added a check to ensure that `check_code` has at least one element and that the first element has at least one sub-element before accessing `check_code[0][0]`. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Please note that typeof behaves differently when used in this context. It gets the type of a variable; in this case it's values that has a type of (&quot;firstName&quot; | &quot;lastName&quot; | &quot;email&quot;)[].
Playground
","To create a string union of the constant values from the `options` array, you can use the `typeof` operator along with the `keyof` operator in TypeScript. Here's how you can fix the problem:

```typescript
const options = [
  { label: 'First Name', value: 'firstName' },
  { label: 'Last Name', value: 'lastName' },
  { label: 'Email', value: 'email' }
] as const;

type Values = typeof options[number]['value']; // 'firstName' | 'lastName' | 'email'

const values: Values[] = options.map(x => x.value); // ['firstName', 'lastName', 'email']
```

In the `Values` type, `typeof options[number]['value']` will give you the union of the constant values `'firstName' | 'lastName' | 'email'`. By using this type, you can ensure that the `values` array only contains these specific values.",0.47355788946151733,"typescript, typescript-typings, react-typescript",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74263069,OpenMP tasks execution time varies depending on where I put the pragmas,"I'm trying to parallelize some code using OpenMP (and MPI) using tasks. I have the following code:
double t_copy = 0, t_forward = 0, t_backward = 0, t_diag = 0;
void pc_ssor_poisson3d(int N, void *data,
                       double *restrict Ax,

    int n = ssor_data-&gt;n;
    double w = ssor_data-&gt;omega;

        parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(n, 0, n, 0, n, 0, n, Ax, w); // --1--

#else
...

This is the function parallel_ssor_forward_sweep:
void parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(int n, int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2, int k1, int k2, double *restrict Ax, double w)
{
    char *dep_matrix = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * (i2 - i1) / BS * (j2 - j1) / BS * (k2 - k1) / BS);
    // --2--
    for (int k = 0; k &lt; (k2 - k1) / BS; k++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; (j2 - j1) / BS; j++)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; (i2 - i1) / BS; i++)
            {
                // ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap(n, i1 + i * BS, i1 + (i + 1) * BS, j1 + j * BS, j1 + (j + 1) * BS, k1 + k * BS, k1 + (k + 1) * BS, Ax, w, dep_matrix, i, j, k);
                ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap(n, i1, i2, j1, j2, k1, k2, Ax, w, dep_matrix, i, j, k);
            }
        }
    }
    free(dep_matrix);
    
}

The function ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap actually creates the OpenMP task, I'll attach the code:
void ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap(int n, int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2, int k1, int k2, double *restrict Ax, double w, char *dep_matrix, int i, int j, int k)

    char *top_dep = k - 1 &gt;= 0 ? &amp;dep_mat(i, j, k - 1) : NULL;
    char *left_dep = j - 1 &gt;= 0 ? &amp;dep_mat(i, j - 1, k) : NULL;
    char *back_dep = i - 1 &gt;= 0 ? &amp;dep_mat(i - 1, j, k) : NULL;
    char *out_dep = &amp;dep_mat(i, j, k);

#pragma omp task depend(in                                          \
                        : *top_dep, *left_dep, *back_dep) depend(inout \
                                                              : *out_dep)

    {
        ssor_forward_sweep(n, i1 + i * BS, i1 + (i + 1) * BS, j1 + j * BS, j1 + (j + 1) * BS, k1 + k * BS, k1 + (k + 1) * BS, Ax, w);
    }
#undef dep_mat
}

Pragma directive:
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
    }

Now the problem is that if I put the directive above to make the code parallel around the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep call (marked with the comment --1-- in the code) I get much better times (around 9.6/9.7 seconds for that code section) vs if I put it around the for marked in the code with --2-- comment, so getting the whole function code but the malloc (times 12.7/12.8 seconds).
I've executed the code 3 times for each to make sure it wasn't a fluke and with the same number of threads (6 in this case).
I'm running on my university machine which supposedly should not have any other program running at the same time as mine for the allocated resources.
The reason why I believe this behaviour is strange is that inside the pragma omp single region I expect one single thread to execute the code, so I don't think having the malloc inside or outside the region should lead to such a difference.
Also the code gives the same result and is run with the same input.
","The problem, as mentioned by @JohnBollinger in the comments, was due to the fact that when I put the pragma as below, the thread that executed the #pragma omp single region could get to the free(dep_matrix) before the other threads had ended.
#ifdef PAR_PC
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
        parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(n, 0, n, 0, n, 0, n, Ax, w);
    }
#else

By putting pragma inside the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep function like below, the thread executing the #pragma omp single region has to wait for the other threads at the end of the region (i.e. before the free(dep_matrix)), and so the matrix is still available when the other threads need it.
void parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(int n, int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2, int k1, int k2, double *restrict Ax, double w)
{
    char *dep_matrix = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * (i2 - i1) / BS * (j2 - j1) / BS * (k2 - k1) / BS);
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
        for (int k = 0; k &lt; (k2 - k1) / BS; k++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; (j2 - j1) / BS; j++)
            {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; (i2 - i1) / BS; i++)
                {
                    // ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap(n, i1 + i * BS, i1 + (i + 1) * BS, j1 + j * BS, j1 + (j + 1) * BS, k1 + k * BS, k1 + (k + 1) * BS, Ax, w, dep_matrix, i, j, k);
                    ssor_forward_sweep_pwrap(n, i1, i2, j1, j2, k1, k2, Ax, w, dep_matrix, i, j, k);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    free(dep_matrix);
}

","The issue you are encountering with the varying execution times of OpenMP tasks depending on the placement of the pragmas is likely due to load balancing and task scheduling. OpenMP task scheduling is implementation-dependent, and the runtime system decides how to distribute tasks among threads.

In your code, when you place the parallel region pragma around the `parallel_ssor_forward_sweep` function call (marked with --1--), you are parallelizing at a finer granularity, resulting in better load balancing and potentially more efficient task scheduling. This can lead to better performance because the tasks are distributed evenly among the available threads.

On the other hand, when you place the parallel region pragma around the outer loop (marked with --2--), you are parallelizing at a coarser granularity. This means that the entire loop is parallelized, and each thread will execute multiple iterations of the loop. This can result in uneven distribution of tasks and potentially inefficient task scheduling, leading to longer execution times.

To fix this issue and achieve more consistent performance, you can try the following approaches:

1. Experiment with different scheduling strategies: OpenMP provides different scheduling strategies, such as static, dynamic, and guided. You can try different scheduling strategies using the `schedule` clause to see if it improves load balancing and reduces execution time.

2. Fine-tune task granularity: Instead of parallelizing the entire loop at once, you can consider parallelizing smaller sections of the loop or even individual tasks. This allows for better load balancing and can potentially improve performance.

3. Use workload distribution techniques: If the workload is unevenly distributed, you can consider using techniques like workload partitioning or load balancing algorithms to distribute the tasks more evenly among the threads.

4. Analyze and optimize dependencies: If there are data dependencies between tasks, analyze them to ensure they are correctly specified using the `depend` clause. Incorrect dependencies can lead to inefficient task scheduling and impact performance.

5. Profile and analyze performance: Use profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks or areas of imbalance in your code. This can help you pinpoint specific sections that can be optimized or parallelized differently.

It's important to note that the performance of parallelized code can be influenced by several factors, including the underlying hardware, the specific workload, and the OpenMP implementation. Therefore, it's often necessary to experiment with different approaches and fine-tune the parallelization strategy to achieve the best performance.",0.7083866596221924,"c, openmp, timing",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74214976,How do you sort input in Python?,"beginning coder here. I was trying to sort words and numbers, and it mostly work. However, when I provided input to sort, it doesn't seem to work.
I tried inserting the input as a variable and it broke the numbers down into single digits, which I did not want to do. I tried converting the input into a float and integers and it did not work. I tried
input1 = input() #I input in 23, 12, 45
sorted(input1)

And I got
[' ', ' ', ',', ',', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5']

I was expecting for it to sort by whole numbers without being broken down.
","If your input is a String, you can convert it to int and add to a list.
Then you can sort the list:
list =  []
x = input(&quot;write:&quot;)
x = x.replace(&quot; &quot;,&quot;&quot;)
y = x.split(&quot;,&quot;)
for i in y:
    if i.isnumeric():
        i = int(i)
        list.append(i)
list.sort()
print(list)

","To fix the issue, you need to modify your code slightly. The `input()` function in Python returns a string, so when you pass the input to the `sorted()` function, it sorts the individual characters instead of the whole numbers.

To sort the numbers as whole numbers, you need to split the input string into a list of numbers and then convert each element to an integer. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
input1 = input(""Enter numbers separated by commas: "")  # input: 23, 12, 45
numbers = input1.split("","")  # split the input string at commas

# convert each element to an integer
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)  # sort the numbers

print(sorted_numbers)
```

In this code, `input1.split("","")` splits the input string at commas, creating a list of individual numbers as strings. Then, using a list comprehension, we convert each element in the `numbers` list to an integer using `int(num)`. Finally, we pass the `numbers` list to the `sorted()` function to get the sorted list of numbers.

When you run this code, it should give you the desired output:

```
Enter numbers separated by commas: 23, 12, 45
[12, 23, 45]
```

This way, the numbers are treated as whole numbers and sorted accordingly.",0.7175952792167664,"python, sorting",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","In your current implementation, the issue lies with the for loop. As JavaScript is single-threaded, the loop will execute synchronously and set the state immediately without any delay. This means that the state will be updated to the last value of the loop, skipping all the intermediate values.

To achieve the desired delay between state updates, you can use a recursive function or an asynchronous loop. Here's an example using recursion:

```javascript
const handleReplay = () => {
  const delay = 500; // Delay in milliseconds
  const maxStep = lastStep; // Last step value

  const updateStateWithDelay = (step) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setStepNumber(step);

      if (step < maxStep) {
        updateStateWithDelay(step + 1);
      }
    }, delay);
  };

  updateStateWithDelay(0);
};
```

In this updated implementation, the `updateStateWithDelay` function is called recursively with a delay between each call. It sets the state to the current step value and then checks if the step is less than the maximum step. If it is, it calls itself with the next step value after the delay.

By using recursion and setTimeout, we can achieve the desired delay between each state update in the loop.",0.6425116062164307,"javascript, reactjs",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

But there are some errors and its generally just playing around -- I have no idea what I am really doing here and need some feedback/help.

Update from comment:
So I extracted the view as follows for now
struct ExtractedView: View {
  @State private var editNoteContent: String = &quot;&quot;
  @FocusState private var editNoteIsFocused: Bool
  @State private var editNote: Note? = nil
  
  func editExistingNote(note: Note?) {
    guard let note else { return }
    note.content = editNoteContent
    PersistenceController.shared.save()
    editNoteContent = &quot;&quot;
    editNoteIsFocused = false
    editNote = nil
  }

But I dont understand how to call it. If I call it with ExtractedView() then the code compiles and the app runs, but it crashes when I enter this path of the app. And when I call it like this:
ExtractedView(
  editNoteContent: editNoteContent,
  editNoteIsFocused: editNoteIsFocused,
  editNote: editNote
)

Then i get lots of errors ... 
","Thanks to the comments and this answer here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682448 I got it to work. I extracted the view as follows:
struct EditNoteView: View {
  
  @Binding var noteContent: String
  @FocusState var isNoteFocused: Bool
  var onsubmit: () -&gt; ()
  var placeholder: String
  
  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      TextField(placeholder, text: $noteContent)
        .onSubmit(onsubmit)
        .focused($isNoteFocused)
      if (!noteContent.isEmpty) {
        Button(action: onsubmit) {
          Image(systemName: &quot;checkmark&quot;)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

and then I call this child view from my parent view (inside the body) with
EditNoteView(
  noteContent: $newNoteContent,
  isNoteFocused: _newNoteIsFocused,
  onsubmit: submitNewNote,
  placeholder: &quot;New Note&quot;
)

Also in my parent views, I have the following definitions for the variables
@State private var newNoteContent: String = &quot;&quot;
@FocusState private var newNoteIsFocused: Bool
func submitNewNote() {
    Note.add(content: newNoteContent)
    newNoteContent = &quot;&quot;
    newNoteIsFocused = false
  }

The main takeaways is that all of the @State things map to @Binding in the childview, and the @FocusState maps to another @FocusState, but there is a _ required before the parameter in the call.
","To extract the component and make it a separate view, you can define a new SwiftUI view called ""ExtractedView"" and pass the necessary bindings and variables as parameters. Here's an example implementation:

```swift
struct ExtractedView: View {
    @Binding var noteContent: String
    @Binding var isFocused: Bool
    
    var submitAction: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            TextField(""New Note"", text: $noteContent)
                .onSubmit(submitAction)
                .focused($isFocused)
            
            if !noteContent.isEmpty {
                Button(action: submitAction) {
                    Image(systemName: ""checkmark"")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Then, in your original view, you can replace the extracted component with `ExtractedView`:

```swift
struct NotesView: View {
    @State private var newNoteContent: String = """"
    @FocusState private var newNoteIsFocused: Bool
    
    func submitNewNote() {
        Note.add(content: newNoteContent)
        newNoteContent = """"
        newNoteIsFocused = false
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ExtractedView(
                noteContent: $newNoteContent,
                isFocused: $newNoteIsFocused,
                submitAction: submitNewNote
            )
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to update the `ExtractedView` struct with the appropriate bindings and variables you want to use. Also, note that you need to pass the `submitNewNote` function as a closure to the `ExtractedView` initializer.

Regarding the updated code you provided, it seems like you're on the right track. However, to call the `ExtractedView`, you need to pass the correct bindings and variables as parameters. Make sure you are passing the appropriate values and types when instantiating `ExtractedView`.",0.6928457021713257,"ios, swift, swiftui",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Now I have state in my parent component (companyIcon), which I need to update based on some validation in the child component. I pass validationCallback as a callback function to the child component and update my parent state based on the value I get from the child.
Now the issue is after I update the parent state, the state value in my child component gets reset. What I am doing wrong in the below implementation ?

","Here are some reasons why you can lose state in child (there could be more, but these apply to you most):
    {displayMyChild &amp;&amp; &lt;MyChildCmp validationCallback={validationCallback}/&gt;}

Here if at one point displayMyChild is truthy, then made falsy, this means the component MyChildCmp will get unmounted, hence all its state will be gone.
But now, even if you didn't have that condition and rendered the MyChildCmp always you would still run into similar problem, this is because you defined MyChildCmp inside another component. When you do that, on each render of the parent component, the function MyChildCmp is recreated, and the reconciliation algorithm of react thinks you rendered a different component type on next render, so it will destroy the component instance. Move definition of that component outside the parent component.
","The issue you're facing is that the child component's state is being reset after the parent component re-renders. This is because the child component is being re-rendered whenever the parent component updates its state.

To fix this issue, you can move the child component outside of the parent component's function body. This way, the child component will not be re-rendered whenever the parent component updates its state.

Here's an updated version of your code:

```javascript
function ParentComp(props) {
    const [companyIcon, setCompanyIcon] = useState({ name: ""icon"", value: '' });

    const validationCallback = useCallback((tabId, hasError) => {

        }
    }, []);

            {displayMyChild && <MyChildCmp validationCallback={validationCallback}/>}
        </div>
    )
}

    const [myAddress, setMyAddress] = useState('');
    const [myAddressExceptions, setMyAddressExceptions] = useState([]);

        if (myAddressExceptions.length > 0) {
            props.validationCallback('MyInfo', true);
        } else {
            props.validationCallback('MyInfo', false);
        }
    }, [myAddressExceptions])

    const handleMyAddressChange = (event) => {
        setMyAddress(event.target.value);
    }

Both tests fail, however expected exceptions are still thrown, from what i understand shouldn't both tests pass?
I've already seen the following post: Test expected exceptions in Kotlin
","Inside class CarDefects, you're having this init block:
init {
    validateDefectCode(_defectCode)
}

Hence, the exception will be thrown during construction.
Let's test the constructor instead with a stripped down CarDefects class. The following tests are passing on my computer.

            CarDefects(defectCode = &quot;122F4&quot;)
        }
    }
}

","The reason for the failure of both tests is that the expected exceptions are not being caught correctly. In Kotlin, when using JUnit, you need to use a lambda expression or a function reference to catch the exception. 

In your first test, you are using `Assertions.assertThrows` to catch the exception. However, you are not asserting anything on the exception itself. To fix this, you can update your first test as follows:

```kotlin
@Test
fun testDefectCodeExceptions() {
    val exception = Assertions.assertThrows(InvalidDefectCodeException::class.java) {
        validateDefectCode(defect.getDefectCode())
    }
    assertEquals(""Defect code must be 4 characters long"", exception.message)
    assertEquals(""SE2@"", exception.defectCode)
}
```

Here, I added assertions to check the message and the defect code of the exception.

In your second test, you are using `assertFailsWith`, which is the correct approach. However, the syntax is incorrect. The correct syntax is:

```kotlin
@Test
fun testDefectCodeExceptions2() {
    assertFailsWith<InvalidDefectCodeException> {
        validateDefectCode(defect2.getDefectCode())
    }
}

","The issue you're encountering is related to operator precedence in Java. In the first code snippet, you have correctly enclosed the ternary expression `(e.getMessage() == null ? ""No further details!"" : e.getMessage())` within parentheses. This ensures that the concatenation `+` operator is applied to the entire expression.

However, in the second code snippet, you have removed the parentheses around the ternary expression. Due to operator precedence rules, the `+` operator has higher precedence than the `==` operator. As a result, the expression `e.getMessage() == null` is evaluated first, and then the `+` operator is applied to the result.

In your case, `e.getMessage() == null` evaluates to `false`, and then the `+` operator concatenates the string ""Unexpected Error: "" with the result of `e.getMessage()`. This is not what you intended and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, you should add parentheses around the concatenation expression, like this:

```java
return ""Unexpected Error: "" + (e.getMessage() == null ? ""No further details!"" : e.getMessage());
```

This ensures that the ternary expression is evaluated first, and then the `+` operator is applied to the entire expression, providing the expected result.",0.7850316166877747,"java, conditional-operator, operator-precedence",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73316485,Rust: Idomatic way to iterate over columns of a 2d vector,"I am new to Rust and wanted to know whats the idomatic way to iterate over columns on a 2d vector.
I know how to do it for a rows, for example finding maximum for each row as below
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![];
let max_in_each_rows = my_2d_vector.iter()
   .map(|&amp;row| row.iter().max())
   .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;64&gt;&gt;();

How do I find maximum for each column without using loops?
","One way to approach this functionally would be something like this:
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![vec![1, 4, 3], vec![3, 3, 3]];
let max_in_each_col =
    my_2d_vector
        .iter()
        .skip(1)
        .fold(my_2d_vector[0].clone(), |mut maxes, row| {
            maxes
                .iter_mut()
                .zip(row.iter())
                .for_each(|(m, col)| *m = std::cmp::max(*m, *col));
            maxes
        });

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, max_in_each_col); // [3, 4, 3]

However, it's a misconception that loops aren't idiomatic Rust. You may find that the above isn't all that readable, and rustfmt formats it into 11 lines. Whereas using loops, although the logic is exactly the same, you get this
let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![vec![1, 4, 3], vec![3, 3, 3]];
let mut max_in_each_col = my_2d_vector[0].clone();
for row in &amp;my_2d_vector[1..] {
    for (m, col) in max_in_each_col.iter_mut().zip(row.iter()) {
        *m = std::cmp::max(*m, *col);
    }
}

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, max_in_each_col); // [3, 4, 3]

in only 6 lines and very readably.
","To find the maximum value for each column in a 2D vector without using loops in Rust, you can utilize the `transpose` function from the `itertools` crate. Here's an example:

First, add the `itertools` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
itertools = ""0.10.0""
```

Then, in your code, import the `izip!` macro and the `Itertools` trait:
```rust
use itertools::izip;
use itertools::Itertools;
```

Finally, you can use the `transpose` function along with the `izip!` macro to iterate over the columns and find the maximum value for each column:
```rust
let my_2d_vector: Vec<Vec<u64>> = vec![
    vec![1, 2, 3],
    vec![4, 5, 6],
    vec![7, 8, 9],
];

let max_in_each_column: Vec<u64> = izip!(my_2d_vector.into_iter().map(Vec::into_iter))
    .map(|column| column.max())
    .collect();

println!(""{:?}"", max_in_each_column);

In this example, `izip!` is used to iterate over the columns of the 2D vector by transposing it. The `map` function is then used to find the maximum value for each column, and `collect` is used to collect the results into a new vector `max_in_each_column`.

Note that `izip!` is a macro that takes an iterator for each column and returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains the elements from each column.",0.7930283546447754,"multidimensional-array, vector, rust, functional-programming, iterator",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72940123,How to use port 443 for both IIS and Tomcat on same server for two different applications,"We are having an application server , we need to host .Net Web api with secure HTTPS link on port 443 using IIS , also a front application (using JAVA) in Tomcat with secured HTTPS link on same 443 port.
We deployed Java front end in tomcat with 443 port but now when tried to start a site in IIS on same port 443 it is not starting since port already in use.
So what steps can be taken so that we will have two different application hosted in IIS and Tomcat with using same 443 port.
","You can configure a reverse proxy for IIS, use port 443 as the traffic forwarding port, and set the two different applications to other ports. Because IIS is used as a reverse proxy server, you can use port 443 to forward to by creating a rewrite rule. on two other different application ports.
you can look at this: Proxy IIS Server to Tomcat Application
","To resolve this issue and use port 443 for both IIS and Tomcat on the same server for two different applications, you can follow these steps:

1. Change the default port of either IIS or Tomcat:
   - Open the Tomcat server.xml file located in the conf directory.
   - Locate the Connector element with the attribute port=""443"".
   - Change the port number to a different value (e.g., 8443).
   - Save the file and restart Tomcat.
   
   OR
   
   - Open the IIS Manager.
   - Select the website or application you want to change.
   - Right-click and select ""Edit Bindings"".
   - Select the HTTPS binding and click Edit.
   - Change the port number to a different value (e.g., 8443).
   - Save the changes and restart IIS.

2. Configure a reverse proxy:
   - Install the IIS URL Rewrite module if not already installed.
   - Open the IIS Manager and select the website or application that will act as the reverse proxy.
   - Double-click on the ""URL Rewrite"" feature.
   - Click ""Add Rule(s)"" on the right-hand side.
   - Choose ""Reverse Proxy"" as the rule template and click ""OK"".
   - Enter the necessary details:
     - Inbound Rules: Specify the URL pattern to match requests for the Tomcat application.
     - Server Variables: Set the necessary server variables to forward the request to the Tomcat server.
     - Outbound Rules: Rewrite the response from the Tomcat server if required.
   - Save the rule and test accessing the Tomcat application through the IIS reverse proxy.

3. Configure SSL certificates:
   - Obtain SSL certificates for both the IIS and Tomcat applications.
   - In IIS, bind the SSL certificate to the HTTPS binding.
   - In Tomcat, configure the SSL certificate in the server.xml file for the new port (e.g., 8443).
   - Restart both IIS and Tomcat to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to host the .NET Web API using IIS and the Java front-end using Tomcat on the same server, both with secure HTTPS links on port 443. The reverse proxy configuration allows IIS to forward requests to the Tomcat application, ensuring that both applications can coexist on the same port.",0.7913431525230408,".net, tomcat, iis, hosting",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    }

    // Add the role counts to the organization object
    organization.putAll(roleCountMap)
}

def outputJson = JsonOutput.toJson(jsonDoc)
println(outputJson)
```

This code iterates over each organization and its roles. It creates a map (`roleCountMap`) to store the count of each role name. For each role, it checks if the role name already exists in the map. If it does, it increments the count; otherwise, it adds the role name to the map with a count of 1.

Finally, the code adds the role counts to each organization object using the `putAll()` method. The resulting JSON is then printed as the output.",0.7851158380508423,groovy,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

00003           5         E       87        1       

What I need to do is to: for replicated IDs perform the mean of VAR and VAR2 (i.e. all the numeric variables. I have many other numeric columns). The mean should not be done for the column code. Moreover since I have different types of HSP for the final data frame I need to keep the first as it appears in the sorting. The same for the column code.
Desired output:
  ID           VAR       HSP     VAR2      CODE
00001           54        B       325.5     1

00003           30        D       55        1       

Edit: the case with 0s:
  ID           VAR       HSP     VAR2      CODE
00001           56        B       345       1

00003           30        D       55        1       

So if there are 0s the mean should not be done.
","For this specific case, you can summarise the IDs like this.
library(dplyr)

df %&gt;%
  group_by(ID) %&gt;%
  summarise(VAR = mean(VAR), HSP = first(HSP), VAR2 = mean(VAR2), CODE = first(CODE))

For a more generalized solution, here's how you get the mean for all numerical columns and the first value for all non-numerical values.
library(dplyr)

df %&gt;% 
  group_by(ID) %&gt;% 
  summarise(across(where(~ is.numeric(.x)), mean),
            across(where(~ !is.numeric(.x)), first))

","To fix the problem and achieve the desired output, we can use the R programming language and the dplyr package, which provides powerful tools for data manipulation.

First, we need to install the dplyr package if it is not already installed. You can use the following command:

```R
install.packages(""dplyr"")
```

Once the package is installed, we can load it into our R environment using the library() function:

```R
library(dplyr)
```

Next, we need to read the data into a data frame. Let's assume the data is stored in a CSV file called ""data.csv"". We can read the data using the read.csv() function:

```R
data <- read.csv(""data.csv"")
```

Now that we have the data in a data frame, we can use the group_by() and summarise() functions from the dplyr package to perform the aggregation. We group the data by the ""ID"" column and calculate the mean of the numeric columns using the summarise() function. We also use the first() function to keep the first value of the ""HSP"" and ""CODE"" columns:

```R
output <- data %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(
    VAR = mean(VAR),
    HSP = first(HSP),
    VAR2 = mean(VAR2),
    CODE = first(CODE)
  )
```

Finally, we can print the output data frame to see the desired result:

```R
print(output)
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
# A tibble: 3 x 5
  ID      VAR HSP   VAR2  CODE
  <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <int>
1 00001  54   B     325.5     1

3 00003  30   D      55       1
```

Note that if there are zeros (0) in the VAR or VAR2 columns, the mean calculation will exclude them automatically.

73674092,How to relation with two table when column value is a array in Laravel,"I need all reports with all officers included in the participants column.
please check the attached image.
https://prnt.sc/CRoELD48J-L5
","You should really have a participant pivot table with report_id and officer_id, and create proper relationships.
What you're asking for is possible through loops and lazy loading, but it will be extremely slow and unoptimized.
","To relate two tables when the column value is an array in Laravel, you can use the Eloquent relationship feature called ""has-many-through"" or create a custom pivot table.

1. Using has-many-through relationship:
   - First, create a new model for the ""Report"" table and another model for the ""Officer"" table.
   - In the ""Report"" model, define the relationship with the ""Officer"" model using the has-many-through relationship.
   - In the ""Report"" model, add the following code:

```php
public function officers()
{
    return $this->hasManyThrough(Officer::class, Participant::class, 'report_id', 'id', 'id', 'officer_id');
}
```

   - In the ""Officer"" model, define the inverse relationship with the ""Report"" model using the belongsToMany relationship.
   - In the ""Officer"" model, add the following code:

```php
public function reports()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Report::class, 'participants', 'officer_id', 'report_id');
}
```

   - Now, you can retrieve all reports with their associated officers by calling the ""officers"" relationship on the ""Report"" model:

```php
$reports = Report::with('officers')->get();
```

2. Using a custom pivot table:
   - If you have control over the database structure, you can create a new table called ""report_officer"" with columns ""report_id"" and ""officer_id"".
   - Create a new model for the ""Report"" table and another model for the ""Officer"" table.
   - In the ""Report"" model, define the relationship with the ""Officer"" model using the belongsToMany relationship.
   - In the ""Report"" model, add the following code:

```php
public function officers()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Officer::class, 'report_officer', 'report_id', 'officer_id');
}
```

   - In the ""Officer"" model, define the inverse relationship with the ""Report"" model using the belongsToMany relationship.
   - In the ""Officer"" model, add the following code:

```php
public function reports()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Report::class, 'report_officer', 'officer_id', 'report_id');
}
```

   - Now, you can retrieve all reports with their associated officers by calling the ""officers"" relationship on the ""Report"" model:

```php
$reports = Report::with('officers')->get();
```

By implementing either of these approaches, you will be able to retrieve all reports with all officers included in the participants column.",0.5894328355789185,"laravel, eloquent-relationship",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","If you are experiencing an issue with the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in Visual Studio Code, where it fails to activate and prompts you to install Git even though Git is already installed, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem:

1. Verify Git installation: Firstly, double-check that Git is installed on your macOS system. Open a terminal and run the command `git --version` to confirm that Git is installed and accessible from the command line. If it's not installed, you can download and install it from the official Git website.

2. Confirm Git path: Ensure that the Git executable is present in the system's PATH environment variable. Open a terminal and run the command `echo $PATH` to see the list of directories in the PATH. Look for the directory where the Git executable is located (usually `/usr/bin/git` or `/usr/local/bin/git`). If it's not present, you might need to add it manually to the PATH.

3. Restart Visual Studio Code: Sometimes, a simple restart of the editor can resolve temporary issues. Close Visual Studio Code completely and then relaunch it to see if the problem persists.

4. Check extension settings: Open the settings in Visual Studio Code by going to File > Preferences > Settings (or by using the keyboard shortcut Command + ,). In the search bar, type ""GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"" to filter the settings related to the extension. Ensure that the settings are correctly configured, and there are no conflicts or errors.

5. Update the extension: If you have an outdated version of the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension, it's possible that the issue has been addressed in a newer release. Open the Extensions view in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the square icon in the left sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + X. Search for ""GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"" and click on the ""Update"" button if an update is available.

6. Reinstall the extension: If none of the above steps resolve the problem, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension. Open the Extensions view, search for the extension, and click on the ""Uninstall"" button. Once uninstalled, restart Visual Studio Code and reinstall the extension by searching for it in the Extensions view.

7. Seek community support: If the issue persists after trying the above steps, it's possible that there might be a bug or compatibility issue with the extension or your specific setup. In that case, it would be helpful to visit the GitHub repository of the extension and check if there are any reported issues or open a new issue describing your problem. The community or the extension's maintainers might be able to provide further assistance or guidance.

","The code provided attempts to flatten a nested data structure into a single flat array. However, it has a few issues that need to be addressed. Here's how you can fix the problem and achieve the desired result:

1. Initialize the `flatArray` and `flatObject` inside the outer loop to ensure they are reset for each iteration.

2. Instead of using nested loops and a temporary object (`flatObject`), you can use a recursive function to traverse the nested data structure and collect the array items into the `flatArray`.

Here's an updated version of the code:

```javascript
const data = [{
  heading: [{
    name: ""Heading 01"",
    Items: [{
      name: ""Item 01"",
      layers: [{
        name: ""layer01"",
        id: 4,
        parent: 3,
        droppable: false,
      }, {
        name: ""layer02"",
        id: 5,
        parent: 3,
        droppable: false,
      }],
      id: 3,
      parent: 2,
      droppable: true,
    }],
    id: 2,
    parent: 1,
    droppable: true,
  }],
  id: 1,
  parent: 0,
  droppable: true,
}];

function flattenData(data) {
  const flatArray = [];

  function flattenItem(item) {
    const flatItem = {};

    for (const prop in item) {
      if (Array.isArray(item[prop])) {
        flatArray.push(flatItem);
        flattenItem(item[prop][0]);
      } else {
        flatItem[prop] = item[prop];
      }
    }

    if (Object.keys(flatItem).length > 0) {
      flatArray.push(flatItem);
    }
  }

  flattenItem(data[0]);
  return flatArray;
}

const flatArray = flattenData(data);
console.log(flatArray);
```

This updated code uses the `flattenData` function to recursively traverse the nested data structure. The `flattenItem` function is called recursively for each nested item, and the array items are pushed into the `flatArray` as they are encountered.

The result will be the desired flat array:

```javascript
[
  {
    id: 1,
    parent: 0,
    droppable: true,
  },
  {
    name: ""Heading 01"",
    id: 2,
    parent: 1,
    droppable: true,
  },
  {
    name: ""Item 01"",
    id: 3,
    parent: 2,
    droppable: true,
  },
  {
    name: ""layer01"",
    id: 4,
    parent: 3,
    droppable: false,
  },
  {
    name: ""layer02"",
    id: 5,
    parent: 3,
    droppable: false,
  }
]
```

This approach recursively flattens the nested data structure and collects the array items into a single flat array.",0.6827815771102905,"javascript, arrays, recursion, data-structures, flatten",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73001297,Use multiple values from the page in an assertion,"I have a fairly complex test involving quite a few elements on the page, need to save the values and use them later in an assertion.
Currently I am using aliases to save the values, as per the docs recommendation. Is there a way to avoid deeply nesting like this?
For example,
cy.get(selector1).invoke('val').as('alias1')
cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('alias2')
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('alias3')
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('alias4')
cy.get(selector5).invoke('text').as('alias5')
// etc

cy.get('@alias1').then((val1) =&gt; {
  cy.get('@alias1').then((val2) =&gt; {
    cy.get('@alias1').then((val3) =&gt; {
      cy.get('@alias1').then((val4) =&gt; {
        cy.get('@alias1').then((val5)=&gt; {
          // assert values against fixture
          expect([val1, val2, val3, val4, val5]).to.deep.eq(myFixture)

","When you set an alias, a property of the same name is also added to the test context.
You can use the function syntax to access &quot;this&quot; context, and read the values in a single callback at the end of the test.
cy.get(selector1).invoke('val').as('val1')
cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('val2')
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('val3')
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('val4')
cy.get(selector5).invoke('text').as('val5')

cy.then(function() {
  const actual = [this.val1, this.val2, this.val3, this.val4, this.val5]
  expect(actual).to.deep.eq(myFixture)
})

","In order to avoid deeply nesting when using aliases to save values and then using them in assertions, you can make use of Cypress's `Promise.all()` method. This method allows you to execute multiple promises concurrently and gather their results in a single array.

Here's how you can refactor your code to avoid nesting:

```javascript
// Save values using aliases
cy.get(selector1).invoke('val').as('alias1');
cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('alias2');
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('alias3');
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('alias4');
cy.get(selector5).invoke('text').as('alias5');

// Use Promise.all() to gather all alias values
cy.then(() => {
  const aliasPromises = [
    cy.get('@alias1'),
    cy.get('@alias2'),
    cy.get('@alias3'),
    cy.get('@alias4'),
    cy.get('@alias5')
  ];

  return Promise.all(aliasPromises);
}).then(([val1, val2, val3, val4, val5]) => {
  // Assert values against fixture
  expect([val1, val2, val3, val4, val5]).to.deep.eq(myFixture);
});
```

By using `Promise.all()`, you can execute all the `cy.get('@aliasX')` commands concurrently, and then use destructuring assignment to extract the values into separate variables. This way, you can avoid nesting and improve the readability of your code.",0.7095499634742737,cypress,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72970327,Unity - UnityEvent<object> as parameter but pass in UnityEvent<CustomClass> not working,"Not sure if this is possible, I can get this to work if I used the explicit type but if I do it that way it will require me to define every possible type, which could be a lot.
BACKGROUND:
I'm trying to add my custom generated list of unity event actions to a target unity event. This is meant to be a generic helper function that I can use in many of my automated editor scripts.
WHAT IM DOING:
I have a function that looks like the following:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
{
  ...
}

Then I'm trying to use it like:
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction, newEntry, true);

Where newEntry is a custom List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; object that contains all the unity events that I want to add to the target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent.
However, when I pass target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent to the function I throws the following error:
Argument 1: cannot convert from 'Invector.vCharacterController.vActions.vOnActionHandle' to 'UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent&lt;object&gt;'

Like I said before I could change my above function to be:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;vOnActionHandle&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)

and it would work. However, it's no longer generic and I would need to pass in every type.
Is this possible to make something like this generic? If so how would I do that conversion?
","I was able to get it to work by not using UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; but instead taking advantage of the concept of generics. Helpful youtube video talking about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnjuFeHLQ2Y
So I converted my above function to be a generic:
public static void SetUnityEvents&lt;T&gt;(T unityEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false) where T : UnityEventBase
{
  ...
}

That requires that a UnityEvent gets passed to unityEvent and doesn't just take anything because all UnityEvents derive from UnityEventBase base. So this allows me to keep the original type and pass ANY type of unity event into this function. Even UnityEvents that take any number of parameters, including custom classes. Pretty awesome!
","The issue you're facing is due to the fact that UnityEvent is not covariant. In other words, UnityEvent<T> cannot be implicitly or explicitly cast to UnityEvent<object>. However, there is a workaround that you can use to make your function generic and accept any type of UnityEvent.

One approach is to use reflection to dynamically invoke the AddListener method of the target UnityEvent. Here's an example of how you can modify your SetUnityEvents function to make it generic:

```csharp
public static void SetUnityEvents<T>(UnityEvent<T> targetEvent, List<UnityEventEntry> entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
{
    if (removeAllListeners)
    {
        targetEvent.RemoveAllListeners();
    }

    foreach (var entry in entries)
    {
        // Get the UnityEventBase from the targetEvent
        var unityEventBase = targetEvent as UnityEngine.Events.UnityEventBase;

        // Get the method info for the AddListener method of UnityEventBase
        var addListenerMethod = unityEventBase.GetType().GetMethod(""AddListener"");

        // Get the type of the UnityEventEntry's UnityEvent
        var entryEventType = entry.unityEvent.GetType();

        // Create a delegate of the AddListener method with the correct generic type
        var addListenerDelegate = Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(Action<>).MakeGenericType(entryEventType), entry.unityEvent, addListenerMethod);

        // Invoke the AddListener method on the targetEvent
        addListenerDelegate.DynamicInvoke(entry.action);
    }
}
```

With this modification, you can now call the SetUnityEvents function with any type of UnityEvent:

```csharp
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent<vLadderAction>().OnDoAction, newEntry, true);
```

Note that this approach uses reflection, which can have a slight performance impact. However, it provides a generic solution without the need to define every possible type explicitly.",0.8360815048217773,"c#, unity3d, generics",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Select *
from table
where (column1 = 'A' and Column2 = 'B' and Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' and Column4 = 'X');

If I have to create a DB index for this query,
Do we need separate DB index for the first half and second half of the OR condition of the query ?
or
A single DB index would be enough containing all columns present in the query?
","TL;DR
Create 2 INDEXes, one on Columns1-3 and the other on Columns1 &amp; 4, INCLUDE all the other columns in the table on both INDEXes, and then use a UNION ALL query instead.
Demonstration
As I mention in the comment, if you wanted to do this in a single query, without a UNION (unlike in Tim Biegeleisen's answer) then more likely you would want an INDEX on Column1, and then INCLUDE all the other columns in your table (all, because you use SELECT * and so return all the columns, even those in referenced in the WHERE).
I do think that Tim's solution would likely be better though, especially with a much larger data set, however, that too should have some INCLUDEs in it. Without those then either a scan will be performed (which isn't helpful here) or a potentially expensive key lookup.
Here's a little demonstration with a sample table and images of the query plans.
Sample data:
CREATE TABLE dbo.YourTable (Column1 char(1),
                            Column2 char(1),
                            Column3 char(1),
                            Column4 char(1),
                            Column5 int);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.YourTable
VALUES('A','B','C','D',7),
      ('A','B','C','F',9),
      ('A','B','D','Z',1),
      ('D','B','C','X',9),
      ('Z','B','C','X',7),
      ('Z','D','C','X',4),
      ('Z','B','C','Y',9);
GO

Create Tim's indexes and test:
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Notice this have 2 table scans, as there are no INCLUDEs (this is not Column5's fault, and I demonstrate this later)
Single SELECT with an INDEX on Column1, but Column5 excluded from INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4);
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


Note this too has a table scan, due to the ommission of Column5. If we add that to the INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


This unfortunately still results in a scan, but of the index this time not the table. For a larger table or for different values of Column1, SQL Server may make a different decision.
Now let's just add an INCLUDE to Tim's indexes:
--Drop mine so that they definitely aren't used
DROP INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable; 
DROP INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable;
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3) INCLUDE (Column4,Column5);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4) INCLUDE (Column2, Column3,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Hazaar! This is what we want. Also, just to confirm however that Column5 wasn't causing the scans earlier, let's drop those INDEXes and also Column5:
DROP INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
DROP INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
ALTER TABLE dbo.YourTable DROP COLUMN Column5;
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


So, there you can see that Column5 wasn't the cause the scans
--Clean up
DROP TABLE dbo.YourTable;

","In this case, it is generally more efficient to create a single database (DB) index containing all the columns present in the query. 

Creating a separate DB index for each half of the OR condition may not provide the desired performance improvement. When you have multiple conditions connected by OR, the database engine needs to evaluate each condition separately. If you create separate indexes, the database engine would have to choose between using one index or the other, resulting in potentially slower query execution.

By creating a single DB index that includes all the columns in the query, the database engine can utilize the index to efficiently filter the data based on all the conditions in the WHERE clause. This consolidated index will allow the engine to quickly locate the required rows, improving the overall query performance.

However, it's important to note that the decision to create an index should be based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the database and the query workload. It's recommended to analyze the query execution plan and perform benchmarking to determine the most effective indexing strategy for your specific scenario.",0.6056667566299438,"sql, sql-server",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

  Free inodes:

","The &quot;unused inodes&quot; reported are inodes at the end of the inode table for each group that have never been used in the lifetime of the filesystem, so e2fsck does not need to scan them during repair. This can speed up e2fsck pass-1 scanning significantly.
The &quot;free inodes&quot; are the current unallocated inodes in the group. This number includes the &quot;unused inodes&quot; number, so that they will still be used if there are many (typically very small) inodes allocated in a single group.
From:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/715165/536354
","In ext4 filesystems, the ""free inodes"" and ""unused inodes"" refer to different aspects of the file system.

1. Free Inodes: 
   - Free inodes represent the number of available and unallocated inodes in a particular block group.
   - Inodes are data structures that store metadata about files in the filesystem, such as file permissions, timestamps, and file size.
   - When a new file is created, an inode is allocated to store its metadata.
   - The ""free inodes"" count indicates how many inodes are currently unallocated and available for use in that specific block group.
   - In your example, Group 0 has 1 free inode.

2. Unused Inodes: 
   - Unused inodes refer to the number of inodes that have been allocated but are not associated with any file or directory.
   - It represents the number of inodes that are not currently being used to store file metadata.
   - In your example, Group 0 has 0 unused inodes, meaning all allocated inodes in that group are associated with files or directories.

The reason why Group 0 has different values for ""free inodes"" and ""unused inodes"" can be attributed to the file system usage pattern. It is possible that all allocated inodes in Group 0 are currently in use by files or directories, resulting in 0 unused inodes. However, there is still one inode available for future file creation, hence the 1 free inode.

It's important to note that the values of ""free inodes"" and ""unused inodes"" can vary across different block groups within an ext4 filesystem, depending on the file system usage and allocation patterns.",0.6299501657485962,"linux, filesystems, inode, ext4, group",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Based on the error message you provided, it seems like the issue is related to the usage of the ""IDENTITY"" function in H2 when inserting an audited revision with Hibernate Envers.

One possible solution is to explicitly set the ""hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"" property to ""none"" in your application.yaml config. This will disable the automatic schema generation and update performed by Hibernate. Instead, you will manually create the schema and tables using SQL scripts or other means.

Here's an updated version of your application.yaml config:

spring:

        temp:
          use_jdbc_metadata_defaults: false
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    show-sql: true

By setting ""hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"" to ""none"", Hibernate won't try to create or alter the schema automatically. You will be responsible for ensuring that the necessary tables and columns are created manually.

Please note that this solution assumes that you have already created the necessary tables and columns for Hibernate Envers in your H2 database. If not, you will need to create them manually using SQL scripts or other means.

If the issue still persists after making these changes, it could be a bug in Hibernate or a configuration issue. In that case, I recommend checking the Hibernate documentation, Spring Boot documentation, and the Hibernate Envers GitHub repository for any reported issues or relevant configuration examples.

CREATE FUNCTION FOO_WITH_GRADES (@GRADE NVARCHAR(30) = NULL) 
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE (@GRADE IS NULL OR GRADE = @GRADE)
)
```

In this modified function, the `@GRADE` parameter is set to `NULL` by default, making it optional. If the `@GRADE` parameter is `NULL`, the WHERE clause condition `@GRADE IS NULL` will evaluate to true, allowing all records to be returned. If the `@GRADE` parameter is provided, it will filter the records based on the grade.

By making this change, your users can now call `FOO_WITH_GRADES` with a specific grade to get filtered results, or without providing the grade parameter to get all records, similar to the original view `FOO`.",0.8311560153961182,"sql, sql-server, function, tsql, inline-table-function",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

type mismatch;

returning a future should not be giving this error, i'm a bit confused as im not able to pinpoint where the mistake is.
Any suggestions would greatly help.Kindly let me know if any more info is required.
","It requires an entity that it can serialize to JSON. HashMap[String, Object] isn't something that Akka is able to serialize out of the box. You have to either change the return type to something other than Object or define a custom marshaller. I doubt that you need an Object serializer, you probably want to have some class here instead. Here you have examples of serialization using spray: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/common/json-support.html
","The error message you are seeing indicates a type mismatch between the expected type `ToResponseMarshallable` and the actual type `Future[List[HashMap[String,Object]]]`. 

To fix this issue, you need to convert the `Future[List[HashMap[String,Object]]]` to an appropriate `ToResponseMarshallable` type that can be handled by akka-http for serialization and sending the response.

One approach to solve this problem is to use the `onComplete` method of the `Future` to handle the completion of the asynchronous operation and then explicitly convert the result to the appropriate response type. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to handle this:

```scala
import akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directives._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

def getList: Route = {
  path(""getList"" / Segment) { name =>
    get {
      onComplete(getListService(name)) { 
        case Success(result) =>
          complete(result) // Assuming you have a suitable marshaller for List[HashMap[String, Object]]
        case Failure(ex) =>
          complete(500, ex.getMessage) // Handle failure case appropriately
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this modified code, we use the `onComplete` method to handle the completion of the `Future[List[HashMap[String,Object]]]`. If the future completes successfully, we use the `complete` directive to send the result as the response. If the future fails, we handle the failure case by sending an appropriate error response.

Make sure you have the necessary imports for `onComplete`, `Success`, and `Failure` from the `scala.util` package. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate marshaller for `List[HashMap[String,Object]]` registered in your akka-http application.

By making these changes, you should be able to resolve the type mismatch error and successfully return the response from your API.",0.6044392585754395,"scala, akka, future, akka-http",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73111730,Does the R2DBC connection pool reuse DB connections?,"I am building a spring application using R2DBC and MySQL. Running an application by deploying it on a server, I noticed a few surprising things.

MySQL connection id grows very fast. my database server already exceeded 1 million connection IDs in 10 days.
As a result of checking with the SHOW PROCESSLIST command, it seems that after R2DBC queries the database, it closes and reconnects instead of returning it to the connection pool immediately. The screenshot is when the application is running the query. The part that says &quot;unauthenticated user&quot; seems to reestablish the database connection.

This seems to cause excessive CPU usage on the database.

My opinion is that if it is a connection pool, it should be used as it is by inheriting the connection, rather than unconditionally closing and reopening the connection when returning it.
Is this behavior intentional in R2DBC? Or is it a connection pool management bug?
","This issue occurred because the version of the R2DBC Pool library referenced in Spring Boot had a bug that immediately evicts the connection pool after use. After upgrading the version of the R2DBC Pool library to 0.9.1, the issue was resolved.
Related PR : https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-pool/issues/129
","The behavior you described is not intentional in R2DBC. It seems like there might be an issue with the connection pool configuration or usage in your application.

By default, R2DBC does support connection pooling, and it should reuse database connections instead of closing and reopening them for each query. This helps improve performance and reduces the overhead of creating new connections.

To fix the problem, you can check the following:

1. Connection Pool Configuration: Make sure that you have properly configured the connection pool settings in your application. This includes parameters like maximum pool size, idle timeout, and connection validation.

2. Connection Pool Provider: Verify that you are using a connection pool provider that is compatible with R2DBC. Common connection pool providers for R2DBC include HikariCP, Apache Tomcat JDBC Pool, and Vibur DBCP.

3. Connection Acquisition and Release: Ensure that you are correctly acquiring and releasing connections from the connection pool in your code. Connections should be acquired when needed and released back to the pool when no longer in use. Make sure you are not inadvertently closing connections instead of releasing them.

4. Connection Leaks: Check for any connection leaks in your application. A connection leak occurs when a connection is acquired but not properly released. This can lead to an excessive number of open connections and cause the connection pool to create new connections unnecessarily.

5. Database Server Configuration: Verify the configuration of your MySQL database server. Ensure that it is properly configured to handle the expected number of connections and that it has enough resources to handle the workload.

If you have checked all these points and the issue persists, it may be worth considering raising a bug report or seeking assistance from the R2DBC community or support channels to investigate the behavior further.",0.68166184425354,"mysql, spring-data-r2dbc",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73870058,How can you use iOS 16's UIPasteControl with React Native?,"iOS 16 introduces UIPasteControl as a way of avoiding the paste permission dialog appearing when an app programmatically accesses the clipboard contents.
To enable UIPasteControl, its target needs to be set to an object that conforms to UIPasteConfigurationSupporting, so typically a UIResponder like UIViewController or UIView. Then you would ensure the object's pasteConfiguration is set to allow the types you want to paste.
I've got a React Native app so there are no native iOS UIView etc. type objects being used directly.
If, for example, a paste button was to be added to a React Native view, then how can that be hooked up so that its using UIPasteControl?
","If we consider the latest version of react native, there might we not see the functionality for UIPasteControl as per new iOS versions.
for this, I guess we should create our implementation and export the functionality to react-native to accomplish this requirement.
If you have hands-on experience with iOS native development and custom native UI views implementation in React Native then you can check out the following blog about the UIPasteControl implementation in native, to implement it natively and export it to React Native.
UIPasteControl(Native) demo : https://blog.kylelanchman.com/how-to-use-uipastecontrol-in-ios-16/
","To use iOS 16's UIPasteControl with React Native, you will need to create a custom native module that bridges the functionality between React Native and the iOS platform.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Create a new Objective-C or Swift file in your Xcode project. Let's call it ""PasteControlModule"".

2. In this file, import the necessary headers:

Objective-C:
```objective-c
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
```

Swift:
```swift
import React

@objc(PasteControlModule)
class PasteControlModule: NSObject {
  // ...
}
```

3. Implement the `RCTBridgeModule` protocol in your module:

Objective-C:
```objective-c
@interface PasteControlModule : NSObject <RCTBridgeModule>
@end
```

Swift:
```swift
extension PasteControlModule: RCTBridgeModule {
  // ...
}
```

4. Implement the necessary methods in your module to handle the paste functionality:

Objective-C:
```objective-c
@implementation PasteControlModule

RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()

RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(paste) {
  // Implement the paste functionality using UIPasteControl
  // This method will be called from your React Native code
}

@end
```

Swift:
```swift
extension PasteControlModule {
  @objc func paste() {
    // Implement the paste functionality using UIPasteControl
    // This method will be called from your React Native code
  }
}
```

5. In your React Native code, import the NativeModules and use the module you just created:

```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const PasteControlModule = NativeModules.PasteControlModule;

// Call the paste method from your React Native component
PasteControlModule.paste();
```

By following these steps, you can create a custom native module that exposes the paste functionality using UIPasteControl to your React Native app. This way, you can use iOS 16's UIPasteControl in your React Native views.",0.8231123089790344,"ios, react-native, uiview, uipasteboard",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Of course I can do:
Try it online!
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
std::size_t constexpr num_bits = 19;
using T =
    std::conditional_t&lt;num_bits &lt;=  8, uint8_t,

    std::conditional_t&lt;num_bits &lt;= 64, uint64_t,
        void&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;;

But maybe there exists some ready made meta function in standard library for achieving this goal?
I created this question only to find out single meta function specifically from standard library. But if you have other nice suggestions how to solve this task besides my proposed above solution, then please post such solutions too...

Update. As suggested in comments, uint_leastX_t should be used instead of uintX_t everywhere in my code above, as uintX_t may not exist on some platforms, while uint_leastX_t always exist.
","There is currently no template type for this in the c++ standard library.
The standard library does have something to do the reverse of what you're looking for (std::numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max).
There is a proposal to add such functionality to the c++ standard library in p0102: &quot;C++ Parametric Number Type Aliases&quot;. A similar question to yours has been asked on lists.isocpp.org/std-proposals, where p0102 was mentioned.
In case you're interested in / okay with using Boost, Boost has boost::int_max_value_t&lt;V&gt;, which is a struct defining type members least (smallest) and fast (&quot;easiest to manipulate&quot;).
","In C++, there is no specific standard library meta function available to directly obtain the smallest integer type that can hold a given number of bits. However, you can achieve this by using the conditional type trait `std::conditional` in combination with the integer types provided by `<cstdint>`.

Here is an alternative solution to your problem:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <type_traits>

std::size_t constexpr num_bits = 19;

template <std::size_t N>
struct SmallestIntegerType {
    using type = typename std::conditional_t<
        N <= 8, std::uint_least8_t,
        typename std::conditional_t<
            N <= 16, std::uint_least16_t,
            typename std::conditional_t<
                N <= 32, std::uint_least32_t,
                typename std::conditional_t<
                    N <= 64, std::uint_least64_t,
                    void
                >::type
            >::type
        >::type
    >::type;
};

using T = typename SmallestIntegerType<num_bits>::type;
```

In this solution, a template struct `SmallestIntegerType` is defined, which takes the number of bits as a template parameter `N`. Inside the struct, `std::conditional_t` is used to select the smallest integer type based on the value of `N`. The result is accessed using the `type` alias.

Note that in this solution, `std::uint_leastX_t` is used instead of `std::uintX_t` to ensure that the smallest available integer type is used, as `std::uintX_t` may not exist on all platforms.

This alternative solution provides a more generic approach that can be easily extended to handle different bit sizes without modifying the code extensively.",0.5761022567749023,"c++, c++20, c++23",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To migrate from webpack to vite with Vue.js for your Chrome extension project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new Vite project:
   - Install Vite globally by running `npm install -g create-vite`.
   - Create a new project by running `create-vite my-project --template vue`.

2. Copy the relevant files from your existing webpack project to the new Vite project:
   - Copy the `src` folder from your webpack project to the new Vite project.
   - Copy the `public` folder from your webpack project to the new Vite project.

3. Update the Vite configuration file (`vite.config.js`):
   - Remove the existing content in `vite.config.js`.
   - Add the following code to configure Vite for your Chrome extension:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    emptyOutDir: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        // Add your entry points here
        // Example: 'popup': '/src/entry/popup/main.js'
      },
      output: {
        entryFileNames: '[name].js',
        chunkFileNames: '[name].js',
        assetFileNames: '[name].[ext]',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

4. Update the HTML template files:
   - In the `public` folder of your Vite project, create a new `index.html` file.
   - Update the content of the `index.html` file to match your desired template.

5. Update the JavaScript entry points:
   - In the `vite.config.js` file, update the `input` section with your desired entry points.
   - For each entry point, specify the corresponding file path relative to the `src` folder.

6. Update the Chrome extension manifest file:
   - In the `public` folder of your Vite project, create a new `manifest.json` file.
   - Update the content of the `manifest.json` file to match your desired configuration.

7. Install necessary dependencies:
   - Install any additional dependencies required for your Chrome extension project using `npm install`.

8. Build and run the Vite project:
   - Run `npm run build` to build the Vite project.
   - The built files will be available in the `dist` folder.
   - To test the extension, you can use the `npm run serve` command to start a local development server.

Note: Since Vite is a fast build tool, you may need to make some adjustments to your code if you were relying on specific features or plugins provided by Webpack. You can refer to the Vite documentation for more details on how to configure specific features or plugins that you need for your project.",0.6425756216049194,"javascript, vue.js, webpack, vite",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74328847,Detect shift + copy keystrokes in javascript,"i'd like to handle keystroke combination of shift + copy. what i am doing is checking if keystrokes shift + cmd + c are all keydown, which is effectively shift + copy.
  var keyPressed = {};

    keyPressed[e.key] = true;
    const keyList = Object.keys(keyPressed);

    const isShiftCopy = [&quot;Meta&quot;, &quot;Shift&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].every((x) =&gt;
      keyList.includes(x)
    );

    if (isShiftCopy) {
      console.log(&quot;shift copy called&quot;);
      e.preventDefault();
    }
  });

this works but it listens to every keystroke though. is there a better way?
here's what i'm doing for basic copy keystrokes.
  window.addEventListener(&quot;copy&quot;, function (e) {
      console.log(&quot;copy called&quot;);

       // TODO can shift be detected at the same time as this copy event?
    });

it'd be great to avoid listening to all possible keystrokes to detect shift + copy.
can shift be detected from copy event listener? or is there another possible solution other than using keydown ?
","The copy event does not have any keystrokes that are carried along with the event. The only way to accomplish this is to simply filter the keystrokes, as you've done in your first example.
If you want to read more into the event object that copy has, it's a ClipboardEvent
However, if you want the copy event to get the current selection, you can use the Selection API to help you see what text / nodes are selected when the user copies things.
","To detect the combination of shift + copy keystrokes in JavaScript, you can use the `keydown` event listener along with the `copy` event. However, listening to every keystroke can be inefficient. 

One alternative approach is to listen for the `copy` event and check if the shift key is pressed simultaneously. Unfortunately, the `copy` event does not provide direct information about modifier keys like shift. Therefore, you cannot detect the shift key directly from the `copy` event listener.

A possible solution to avoid listening to all possible keystrokes is to use a combination of `keydown` and `keyup` events to track the state of the shift key. Here's an updated code snippet:

```javascript
var isShiftKeyPressed = false;

window.addEventListener(""keydown"", function(e) {
  if (e.key === ""Shift"") {
    isShiftKeyPressed = true;
  }
});

window.addEventListener(""keyup"", function(e) {
  if (e.key === ""Shift"") {
    isShiftKeyPressed = false;
  }
});

window.addEventListener(""copy"", function(e) {
  if (isShiftKeyPressed) {
    console.log(""Shift + Copy called"");
    e.preventDefault();
  }
});
```

In this code, we maintain a variable `isShiftKeyPressed` to keep track of the shift key state. The `keydown` event sets the variable to `true` when the shift key is pressed, and the `keyup` event sets it back to `false` when the shift key is released. Then, in the `copy` event listener, we check if the shift key is pressed along with the copy event.

This approach allows you to detect the shift + copy combination without listening to all possible keystrokes and without relying solely on the `copy` event.",0.5588647127151489,"javascript, keyevent",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

                )

","The Second code in my question won't work.
I found similar questions, Storing Variables in Python Class, Attributes initialization/declaration in Python class: where to place them?
According to above questions, class attributes cannot be shared by __dict__ function.
class A(object):
    foo = None
class B(object):
   def __init__(self):
       self.foo = None

A.__dict__
# result
# mappingproxy({'__module__': '__main__', 'foo': None, '__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'A' objects&gt;, '__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'A' objects&gt;, '__doc__': None})
B.__dict__
# result
# mappingproxy({'__module__': '__main__', '__init__': &lt;function B.__init__ at 0x110805790&gt;, '__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'B' objects&gt;, '__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'B' objects&gt;, '__doc__': None})

There is differences which django library call models. Therefore, when we define models, we must avoid define attributes in __init__ functions. That makes unexpected errors.
Especially, in django Migration Section, the django cannot recognize fields, then it won't create columns or delete your columns. And in objects.create(), the column names.
Then, how about declare the function in front of assigning field attributes like below?
class HyperLinks(models.Model):
    @staticmethod
    def validate_links(data):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        example

                raise ValidationError(

                    'link and type should be string'
                )

    links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links])

There is an Exception TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not callable.
(Related link).
To fix it, I can change last line like links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links.__get__(object)])
Eventually, to validate fields, the best way is create the functions separated from Model class which recommended by django docs and @0sVoid.
","In Django, it is not recommended to define fields in the `__init__` method of a model. The preferred way is to define the fields as class attributes, as shown in the first code example you provided.

The reason for this is that Django's model system relies on the fields being defined as class attributes in order to properly handle database migrations, model form generation, and other features. Defining fields in the `__init__` method can lead to unexpected behavior and issues with these features.

If you need to perform validation or customization on the fields, you can use various built-in model methods such as `clean_fields()`, `clean()`, or `validate_unique()`. These methods allow you to write custom validation logic for individual fields or the model as a whole.

In your specific example of the `HyperLinks` model, instead of defining the `links` field in the `__init__` method, you can define it as a class attribute and then use the `clean_fields()` method to perform validation. Here's an example:

```python
class HyperLinks(models.Model):
    links = models.JSONField(default=[])

    def clean_fields(self, exclude=None):
        super().clean_fields(exclude=exclude)
        self.validate_links(self.links)

    @staticmethod
    def validate_links(data):
        # Your validation logic here
        # ...
```

By overriding the `clean_fields()` method and calling `self.validate_links()` within it, you can perform your custom validation on the `links` field whenever the model is saved or validated.

Remember to import the necessary dependencies (`models`, `ValidationError`) at the top of your file.",0.39296993613243103,"python, django",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74162662,"How to convert a List<Entity> where each element points to other Entities into Map<String, Entity> in Java","I am having a class as
public class Entity {
    private String id;
    private List&lt;Entity&gt; children;
    
    // getters, constructor, etc.
}

Now I need to convert this Entity class data into Map&lt;String, Entity&gt;
My Method accepts (List entity) as Input and that need to be converted to Map
I tried like:
public static Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; group(List&lt;Entity&gt; entities) {
    
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (Entity e : entities) {
        if (!map.containsKey(e.getId())) {
            map.put(e.getId(), ??? e.getChildren() ???); // my point of confusion
        }
    }
    return map;
}

My problem is that I don't know how to proceed at the point when I need to access children-entities via getChildren(). How it can be implemented to get the proper data?
Sample data format is as follows.
[
 {
    id: bos
    childs:[
        {
            id: manager1
            childs: [{id: worker11}, {id: worker12}]
        },
        {
            id: manager2
            childs: [{id: worker21}, {id: worker22}]
        }
    ]
 }
]

","Basically, you have a disjointed Graph of Entities.
Therefore, you need to implement a graph traversal algorithm in order to the data of the Entities into the resulting Map.
One of the simplest algorithms commonly used for such purposes is the Depth first search.
The core idea behind this algorithm:

Maintain a Stack, containing the element that are being examined.
Search starts from the root element being pushed on the top of the stack.
Elements are being repeatedly removed from the top of the stack. And if the next element has children that haven't been yet seen, they are being pushed on the top of the stack.

Here's how the iterative implementation might look like:
public static Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; group(List&lt;Entity&gt; entities) {
    
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    Set&lt;String&gt; seen = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
    
    for (Entity e : entities) {
        if (seen.add(e.getId())) { // entity was not previously encountered
            addAllChildren(result, seen, e);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

/**
 * Depth first search algorithm implementation
 */
public static void addAllChildren(Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; result,
                                  Set&lt;String&gt; seen,
                                  Entity root) {
    
    Deque&lt;Entity&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();
    stack.push(root);
    
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        Entity current = stack.pop();
        result.put(current.getId(), current);
        
        for (Entity child: current.getChildren()) {
            if (seen.add(child.getId())) {
                stack.push(child);
            }
        }
    }
}

","To convert a `List<Entity>` into a `Map<String, Entity>`, you can use a recursive approach. Here's how you can modify your `group` method to achieve this:

```java
public static Map<String, Entity> group(List<Entity> entities) {
    Map<String, Entity> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (Entity e : entities) {
        if (!map.containsKey(e.getId())) {
            map.put(e.getId(), e);
            if (e.getChildren() != null) {
                Map<String, Entity> childMap = group(e.getChildren());
                map.putAll(childMap);
            }
        }
    }
    return map;
}
```

In this modified version, we first add the current `Entity` to the map using its `id` as the key. Then, if the `Entity` has children (`e.getChildren() != null`), we recursively call the `group` method on the children and add the resulting map to the original map using `putAll()`.

This way, the method will traverse the entire tree structure of `Entity` objects and add them to the map with their respective `id` values as keys.",0.706929624080658,"java, list, algorithm, hashmap",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","
I don't now how to add a new tag_id instead of replacing the old one

See modifying arrays in the docs and use the array_append function for that:
UPDATE user_account
SET tag_property = array_append(tag_property, $1)
WHERE email = $2;

If your frontend code is actually sending an array of multiple items to add, you can use
UPDATE user_account
SET tag_property = tag_property || $1::text[]
WHERE email = $2;

","The error ""Malformed Array Literal"" occurs because you are trying to insert a string value as an array literal in the PostgreSQL array column. To fix this issue, you need to make sure you are passing the array value correctly.

In your code, you are constructing the array literal in the `InsertTagUserAccount` function. However, you need to ensure that the `tag_id` value is properly formatted as an array literal before sending it in the request body.

To fix this, you can modify your code as follows:

```javascript
InsertTagUserAccount() {
    const tagIdArray = [this.tagIdInput]; // Convert the tagIdInput to an array
    fetch('http://192.168.1.51:3000/api/v1/tag_insertion', {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            email: 'monemail@gmail.com',
            tag_id: tagIdArray, // Pass the array directly
        }),
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
}
```

By creating an array `tagIdArray` and assigning `this.tagIdInput` as its only element, you ensure that the `tag_id` value is correctly formatted as an array literal.

I dont see the Bucket on my Amazon S3 buckets list because I am not the owner. Therefore, I cannot change the permissions there (or can I change the settings on an invisible bucket?).
","When uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket that belongs to a different account, use ACL=bucket-owner-full-control. This will 'handover' ownership of the object to the other account.
This is a very strange behaviour of Amazon S3 that they have now corrected by offering the ability to  disable ACLs and enforce the Bucket owner. If the owner of the bucket configures this setting, then it will work as expected (without needing to specify the ACL on upload).
See: Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket - Amazon Simple Storage Service
","If you are writing into someone else's S3 bucket but no one can read it, there are a few things you can check and potentially fix:

1. Check Bucket Permissions: First, ensure that the bucket owner has granted permission for others to read the objects in the bucket. They can do this by setting appropriate bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs). As you mentioned, since you are not the owner of the bucket, you won't be able to directly change the permissions. The owner of the bucket needs to make the necessary changes.

2. Verify Object Permissions: Even if the bucket has proper permissions, it's possible that the objects you are writing into the bucket have restrictive permissions. Make sure that the objects you are uploading have appropriate read permissions for the bucket owner or the intended audience.

3. Communication with the Bucket Owner: If you are unable to read the objects you are writing into the bucket, it's best to communicate with the bucket owner and inform them about the issue. They can review the permissions and make any necessary adjustments to grant you the required access.

Regarding the visibility of the bucket in your Amazon S3 buckets list, if you are not the owner of the bucket, it won't be visible in your list. Only the bucket owner can manage the bucket's settings and permissions.",0.8124430179595947,"amazon-web-services, amazon-s3",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

73772360,Is there a limit to number of redirect URIs that you can register with OAuth2 provider?,"As the title of the question, is there a limit to number of callback/redirect URIs that you can register with OAuth2 IDP provider like Okta, Google, etc?
I need to know this limit as I am building suite of web applications deployed on separate subdomains but need them to share the same session. My thought is to share the same client id and client secret with all these apps so that access_token and refresh_token can be reused.
","The specification does not limit this. A client can have as many redirect URIs as it wishes. Concrete authorization server might have their own limits. You would have to check with each vendor separately to verify the limit of redirect URIs they allow.
Maybe a better solution would be to have one app that is responsible for obtaining the tokens and then it could establish a session with all the different applications. I think having one backend responsible for handling a session is better than relying on the lifespan of an access token. In fact, access tokens are not meant as a session-carrying mechanism. They are not related to user sessions, and you should rely on other tools for that. You can still use Google to verify the identity of a user, but you should handle the session separately.
","The limit to the number of redirect URIs that you can register with an OAuth2 provider like Okta, Google, etc. typically depends on the specific provider's implementation. There is no universal limit set by the OAuth2 specification. 

However, it's important to note that registering a large number of redirect URIs may not be a scalable or recommended approach. Instead, you should consider using wildcard subdomains or a single redirect URI that can handle requests from multiple subdomains.

For example, you can register a wildcard redirect URI such as `https://*.example.com/callback` that covers all subdomains of your web applications. This way, you can handle authentication and authorization requests from any subdomain using a single callback endpoint.

To achieve this, you will need to configure your OAuth2 client settings with the wildcard redirect URI and ensure that your server-side code can handle requests from different subdomains and manage the shared session accordingly.

Keep in mind that while sharing the same client ID and client secret across multiple applications can simplify the authentication process, it also means that compromising one application's client secret could potentially impact the security of all the applications. So, it's essential to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your client credentials.

Additionally, it's worth checking the documentation or contacting the specific OAuth2 provider (e.g., Okta or Google) to understand any specific limits or recommendations they may have regarding redirect URIs or multi-subdomain setups.",0.7268797755241394,"authentication, oauth-2.0, google-oauth",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72901581,Host identification in Docker container,"PROBLEM:
My application consists of one server and two clients which can be run on Windows, Linux, MAC operating systems. My goal is for the server to be able to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host or different ones. When clients work outside of a container, this can be done easily (for example, using a /etc/machine-id). The problem arises when containers come into play. The same /etc/machine-id is no longer unique across containers.
RESTRICTIONS:
The environment of docker containers cannot be changed (that is, it is not possible to use environment variables or volumes)
QUESTION:
Is there a way, maybe OS-specific or not, to identify a host that is independent of whether containerization is used or not?
","SOLUTION:
I used the host boot time to identify the host. Windows, Linux and MAC provide ways to get this information. These methods return the boot time of the host when called from a container. This is not a completely accurate solution to my problem, since there is some possibility that the hosts were running at the same time, but this probability is small enough to be neglected.
","In this scenario, where the environment of docker containers cannot be changed, and using environment variables or volumes is not an option, we need to find an alternative approach to identify the host that is independent of containerization.

One possible solution is to utilize the Docker API to gather information about the host machine. The Docker API provides a way to access various details about the Docker environment, including information about the host machine.

Here is a step-by-step process to implement this solution:

1. Inside the Docker container, install the Docker client.
2. Use the Docker client to connect to the Docker daemon running on the host machine.
3. Utilize the Docker API to retrieve information about the host machine. Specifically, you can use the ""/info"" endpoint to get details about the host system.
4. Extract the necessary information from the response, such as the hostname or unique identifier of the host machine.
5. Use this extracted information to determine if the clients are running on the same physical host or different ones.

By using the Docker API, you can access host-specific information without relying on environment variables or volumes, making it independent of containerization.

Note that this solution assumes that the Docker daemon is running on the host machine and is accessible from within the container. Additionally, you may need to handle any potential security or access restrictions when connecting to the Docker daemon from within the container.

","To fix the issue you're facing, you need to make sure that the ""listPersons"" attribute is being properly passed to the Thymeleaf template.

Based on the code snippet you provided, it seems that you're correctly adding the ""listPersons"" attribute to the model in your Java method:

```java
model.addAttribute(""listPersons"", personaService.getAll());
```

Now, let's take a look at your Thymeleaf template code:

```html
<h2 th:if=""${#lists.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">No hay personas</h2>
<div th:if=""${#!lists.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">
```

The issue seems to be with the syntax of the Thymeleaf expression. The correct syntax for checking if a list is empty using Thymeleaf is:

```html
<h2 th:if=""${#lists.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">No hay personas</h2>
<div th:unless=""${#lists.isEmpty(listPersons)}"">
```

Notice the use of `th:unless` instead of `th:if` in the second line. `th:unless` will render the div only if the list is not empty.

Additionally, make sure that you have the Thymeleaf Spring dialect configured in your application. You can add the following dependency in your Maven `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>

I have looked through the container setup, and I don't see anything.  Is there an option I need to enable to allow the container to be queryable?
EDIT 1
After playing with this for a bit.  I am encountering behavior I would not normally expect to see.  A bit of boring background:

I am doing TDD with a unit test project for a .NET 6 library

Class has a constructor and a single async method

This TEST code in the constructor works:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
deltest.DeleteContainerAsync().Wait();

This TEST code in the async method exits the unit test project debug mode instantly:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
await deltest.DeleteContainerAsync();

I am recreating containers using data explorer between invocations.
","FACEPALM
After looking at this: Cosmos DB call never returns with async call
Remember kids: A unit test project example test method isn't async when you first create the class.
Changing the test method to async and adding await fixed the issue.
","Based on the information provided, it seems like there might be an issue with accessing the container in Azure Cosmos DB. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem:

1. Check the connection string: Ensure that the EndpointUri and PrimaryKey used to create the CosmosClient are correct. Double-check the values to make sure there are no typos or missing characters.

2. Verify network connectivity: The error message ""A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network"" suggests that there might be an issue with network connectivity. Check if your machine has access to the Cosmos DB service by pinging the endpoint or trying to access it through a web browser.

3. Check the resource permissions: Ensure that the user or service principal used to access the Cosmos DB has the necessary permissions to read containers. Verify the access policies and roles assigned to the user or service principal.

4. Enable diagnostics logging: Enable diagnostics logging for your Cosmos DB account. This will provide more detailed information about any exceptions or errors that occur during the container access. You can find the logs in the Azure portal under the ""Monitoring"" or ""Diagnostics"" section of your Cosmos DB account.

5. Review firewall and IP whitelisting: If you have configured any firewall rules or IP whitelisting for your Cosmos DB account, make sure that your machine's IP address is allowed to access the service.

6. Check for any SDK or library compatibility issues: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Azure Cosmos DB SDK and that it is compatible with your .NET version. Check for any known issues or bugs related to container access in the SDK's documentation or release notes.

7. Test with a different container or database: Create a new container or use an existing one in a different database to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is specific to a particular container or if it is a broader issue with the Cosmos DB account.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to reach out to the Azure support team for further assistance.

My question is: I think the optimum K is 3 in my case (this is where a sudden drop occurs/point of inflection)? But looking at my X_PCA_1 VS. X_PCA_2 plot, I think the data can be clustered into 2 clusters only? or am I mistaken?
Note: I am still a beginner.
K-elbow

","If you want to plot to see clearly the clusters, first you can use PCA with 3 components:
pca = PCA(3)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(scaled_df)

Then, you can append each point to each dimension:
X = []
Y = []
Z = []
for i in X_pca:
    X.append(i[0])
    Y.append(i[1])
    Z.append(i[2])

From here you can choose a library to plot 3d graphs.
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
cluster_kmeans = model.fit_predict(scaled_df)

df_graph = pd.DataFrame({'X': X,
                         'Y': Y,

","Based on the provided information, it seems like you have performed the necessary steps to determine the optimum number of clusters using the elbow method. The elbow plot helps in identifying the point of inflection where the rate of decrease in the sum of squared distances slows down significantly. In your case, it appears that the elbow point is at K=3.

However, it's important to note that the elbow method is not always definitive, and there can be some subjectivity involved in interpreting the results. It's possible that even though the elbow point suggests K=3, the visualization of the data in the X_PCA_1 vs. X_PCA_2 plot indicates that the data can be better clustered into 2 distinct clusters.

In such cases, it's advisable to consider other factors like domain knowledge or the specific requirements of your application to make a final decision on the number of clusters. Additionally, you can also try other clustering evaluation methods like silhouette score or gap statistic to validate and refine your choice of K.

Following test case fails because I was expecting to have the productId populated in the ProductLine object but it is not. Is this the expected behavior of Spring Data JDBC?

Yes, if you want a productId you have to (and can easily) populate it yourself using plain Java code.
But you really shouldn't need the productId in the first place since if you follow Domain Driven Design, you will access a ProductLine exclusively from a Product which already has the id at hand.
The article https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/22/spring-data-jdbc-how-do-i-make-bidirectional-relationships might be helpful.

If I change Set&lt;ProductLine&gt; to List&lt;ProductLine&gt;, it fails due to JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException, which means the product id set to 0 as seen in the log snippet below.

You have two problems here:

You already have two sources for the product_id field: The relation from the aggregate root and the simple field, which may cause problems.

You mapped both the back reference to the aggregate root idColumn and the index of the list keyColumn to the same database column. Together with the simple field from above these are three values all mapped to the same column. Not good.
The value that seems to win is the list index, resulting in the exception.
In order to fix that, create an additional column in the product_line table and map the list index to it.


","Problem 1: The issue you're facing is that the `productId` is not being populated in the `ProductLine` object. This is the expected behavior of Spring Data JDBC. By default, Spring Data JDBC does not automatically populate the child objects with the parent's ID. You will need to manually set the `productId` in the `ProductLine` object before saving it.

To fix this, you can modify your test case as follows:

```java
@Test
void saveTest() {
    Product product = Product.builder()
            .name(""Product-1"")
            .description(""Description"")
            .build();

    ProductLine productLine = ProductLine.builder()
            .productId(product.getProductId()) // Set the productId manually
            .label(""Line-label"")
            .build();

    product.setLines(Collections.singleton(productLine));

    this.productRepository.save(product);

    // Assertions...
}
```

By setting the `productId` in the `ProductLine` object manually, it will be correctly associated with the parent `Product` object.

Problem 2: When you change `Set<ProductLine>` to `List<ProductLine>`, you encounter the `JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException` because the `product_id` is set to 0 in the SQL insert statement. This happens because the `productId` in the `ProductLine` object is not being correctly associated with the parent `Product` object.

To fix this issue, you can modify your `Product` entity by adding a `@MappedCollection` annotation to explicitly specify the `keyColumn`:

```java
@Data
@Builder
public class Product {

    @Id
    private Long productId;

    private String name;

    private String description;

    @Singular
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = ""product_id"", keyColumn = ""product_id"")
    private List<ProductLine> lines;
}
```

With this change, Spring Data JDBC will correctly associate the `productId` in the `ProductLine` object with the parent `Product` object, and you won't encounter the integrity constraint violation exception.

....
return {f'uid': uid,'title': title, 'string': string,'create-time': create_time, 'edit-time': edit_time, 'children': children, 'refs': refs}

Sometimes some of these values can be None (ex: when the title has a value, the string's value will be None, and vice-versa). The application I'm using does not recognize keys with None values, how do I prevent those keys from returning when the values are None?
Thank you in advance.
","You can achieve this using dictionary comprehension:
return {key:value for key,value in {f'uid': uid,'title': title, 'string': string,'create-time': create_time, 'edit-time': edit_time, 'children': children, 'refs': refs}.items() if value is not None }


","To prevent keys with None values from being returned in the recursive function, you can modify the return statement to filter out the None values before constructing the dictionary. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def recursive_function(data):
    # ...
    
    # Create a dictionary with all the keys and values
    result = {
        'uid': uid,
        'title': title,

    }
    
    # Filter out keys with None values
    result = {key: value for key, value in result.items() if value is not None}
    
    return result
```

In this code, we first create a dictionary with all the keys and values, including the ones that might be None. Then, we use a dictionary comprehension to filter out the keys with None values by checking if the value is not None. The resulting dictionary will only contain the keys with non-None values.

By using this approach, you can ensure that keys with None values are not returned in the final dictionary.",0.7986584305763245,"python, json, python-3.x",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Filter section before applying filter

Filter section after applying filter

References:
https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/control-report-filters
","Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that you are trying to apply a filter to the Power BI report using the PowerBIEmbed component in React. However, the filter is not working as expected.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure you are applying the filter correctly. Here are a few steps you can follow:

1. Check the column name: Ensure that the column name you are using in the filter (`CustomColumnJson.Id`) matches the actual column name in the Power BI report.

2. Verify the table name: Confirm that the table name you are using in the filter (`Event`) is correct and matches the table name in the Power BI report.

3. Check the filter operator and values: Ensure that the filter operator (`In`) and the filter values (`XYZ`) are correct. Double-check the syntax and ensure that the values are valid for the column you are filtering.

4. Check the telemetry query: Verify that the telemetry query in the Power BI report is correctly set up to filter data based on the `CustomColumnJson.Id` column. Make sure the query is working as expected when tested directly in Power BI.

5. Validate the embed URL and access token: Confirm that the `embedUrl` and `accessToken` values in the `embedConfig` object are correct and valid. Double-check the syntax and ensure that the access token has the necessary permissions to apply filters.

If you have tried these steps and the filter is still not working, you may need to further investigate the issue by checking the console for any error messages or debugging the Power BI report and telemetry query.

It's important to note that without more information about the specific error or behavior you are experiencing, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. It may be helpful to review the Power BI API documentation or consult the Power BI community for further assistance.",0.697225034236908,"reactjs, powerbi, powerbi-embedded, powerbi-custom-visuals",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I want to search if this array contains for example 2 414 425.
I tried something like this:
 SELECT * FROM  table_name t where t.numbers @&gt; '2 414 425'
But it doesnt return anything even when it should.
","The @&gt; operator needs a proper JSON object on the right hand side:
where t.numbers @&gt; '[&quot;2 414 425&quot;]'

This should work if numbers is defined as jsonb (which it should be). Otherwise cast it numbers::jsonb
Checking if at least one of multiple keys is contained in the JSON array can be done using the ?| operator:
where t.numbers ?| array['2 414 425', '13261999']

The ?&amp; operator will check if all those keys are contained in the JSON array.
","The issue with your query is that you are using the `@>` operator, which is used for checking if one jsonb object contains another jsonb object. In your case, you have an array of strings, so you need to use the `?` operator instead.

Here's how you can fix your query to search if the array contains the value ""2 414 425"":

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name t WHERE t.numbers ? '2 414 425';
```

The `?` operator checks if the left-hand side operand (in this case, the `numbers` column) contains the right-hand side operand (the value '2 414 425'). This will return the rows where the array contains the specified value.

Note that the values in your array are enclosed in double quotes and escaped with backslashes. If you want to search for the value without the quotes and backslashes, you can use the `replace` function:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name t WHERE t.numbers ? replace('2 414 425', ' ', '');
```

This will remove the spaces from the value before searching in the array.

74591448,"Why is my Either-returning method always returning Left, irrespective of what happened?","The use case here is that I have added a method to an Entity Framework DbContext that does some extra work before saving, and then returns an Either depending on the results. A very simplified version of this looks like this...
static async Task&lt;Either&lt;string, Unit&gt;&gt; SaveChangesAsyncEither(string userId) {
  // In reality, this would do some auditing, check for concurrency issues, and
  // attempt to save the changes. It would return unit if all went OK, 
  // or an error message if not. Simple check for demonstrating the issue...
  if (userId == &quot;jim&quot;) {
    return &quot;We don't like Jim&quot;;
  }
  return unit;
}

This method is used in many places in my solution, and wors fine.
In one minimal API project, I have a method that looks like this (again, highly simplified)...
static async Task&lt;Either&lt;DeviceApiResponseStates, DeviceApiResponseStates&gt;&gt; CreateDevice(string userId) {
  // In reality we would have more parameters, create a device, etc before
  // calling SaveChangesAsyncEither
  return (await SaveChangesAsyncEither(userId))
      .Match(() =&gt; Right&lt;DeviceApiResponseStates, DeviceApiResponseStates&gt;(DeviceApiResponseStates.OK),
        _ =&gt; Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah));
}

...where DeviceApiResponseStates is an enum. For simplicity, you can imagine it looks like this...
enum DeviceApiResponseStates {
  OK,
  Nah
}

Those three code blocks are a complete sample of my problem.
I would expect that if I call CreateDevice(&quot;jim&quot;), then I would get a Left with a value of Nah, and if I call it with any other string value, I would get a Right with a value of OK.
However, when I try this...
Console.WriteLine((await CreateDevice(&quot;&quot;))
  .Match(_ =&gt; &quot;Yeah&quot;, ex =&gt; $&quot;Exception: {ex}&quot;));

... I get Nah, irrespective of the string value.
Anyone able to explain what I'm doing wrong?
",,"In the provided code, the issue lies in the implementation of the `SaveChangesAsyncEither` method. The method always returns a `Left` value, even if the conditions are not met. This is why you are always getting the value ""Nah"" in the `CreateDevice` method.

To fix this, you need to modify the implementation of the `SaveChangesAsyncEither` method to return `Right` when all conditions are met and `unit` when there are no errors. Here's an updated version of the method:

```csharp
static async Task<Either<string, Unit>> SaveChangesAsyncEither(string userId)
{
    if (userId == ""jim"")
    {
        return Left(""We don't like Jim"");
    }
    
    // Perform auditing, check for concurrency issues, and attempt to save changes
    
    return Right(unit);
}
```

With this change, the `CreateDevice` method will correctly return `Left` with a value of ""Nah"" when the `SaveChangesAsyncEither` method returns `Left`, and `Right` with a value of `DeviceApiResponseStates.OK` when it returns `Right`.

You can now use the `CreateDevice` method as follows:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine((await CreateDevice(""jim""))
    .Match(_ => ""Yeah"", ex => $""Exception: {ex}""));
```

This will output ""Nah"" because the `SaveChangesAsyncEither` method returns `Left` with the message ""We don't like Jim"" when the `userId` is ""jim"".",-0.05669223517179489,"c#, functional-programming, language-ext",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

n = 3
output = split(arr, n)
print(output[0])  # yellow subarray
print(output[1])  # red subarray
print(output[2])  # blue subarray
```

This modified code uses numpy's slicing to extract the desired columns from the original array. It calculates the number of columns in each subarray by dividing the total number of columns by the number of desired subarrays. Then, it iterates over each subarray and extracts the corresponding columns from the original array using slicing. Finally, it appends each subarray to the output list.

Is there any documentation that describes this &quot;m&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. In the k8s documentation, I could see for &quot;Mi&quot;, &quot;Gi&quot; etc, but not this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
","After some research i got this :
Those are Kubernetes-style quantities, Instead of displaying things as a decimal, it will display with SI suffixes. For instance, 1.5 becomes 1500m. When Kubernetes displays a quantity, it will tend to use milli-units if there would be a decimal point, and plain units otherwise. So, if it had to display 500 on the dot, it would just display 500, but if it's 500.5, it would display 500500m. So m means divide by 1000, k means times 1000. There's no documentation really except this. Search for &quot;Kubernetes-style quantities&quot; if you want to see more examples.
1m/750m = (1/1000)/(750/1000) = 0.001/.75 = .1%/75%
refer this link also
","Based on the information provided, it seems like you are referring to a problem related to the unit of measurement in Kubernetes. In the image you mentioned, there might be references to lower case ""m"" and ""k"" units. 

In Kubernetes, the unit ""m"" represents milli and ""k"" represents kilo. These units are commonly used in resource limits and requests for CPU and memory in Kubernetes. 

For example, if you specify a value of ""100m"" for CPU, it means 100 milliCPU or 0.1 CPU. Similarly, if you specify a value of ""500Mi"" for memory, it means 500 mebibytes or approximately 524 megabytes. 

The documentation you mentioned might not explicitly mention the lower case ""m"" and ""k"" units, as they are commonly understood in the context of Kubernetes resource management. However, the Kubernetes documentation does provide information on resource units like ""Mi"" (mebibytes) and ""Gi"" (gibibytes), which are used for memory.

If you are looking for more detailed information on the units used in Kubernetes, you can refer to the official Kubernetes documentation, specifically the sections related to resource management and specifying resource limits and requests. Additionally, the Kubernetes API reference documentation provides detailed information on the supported units and their usage.

I hope this clarifies the unit of measurement in your Kubernetes setup. Let me know if you need further assistance!",0.7462485432624817,"kubernetes, horizontalpodautoscaler",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Note: x / xx / xxx - is number, The length of the number is unknown, The cell type is CLOB
for example:
SELECT 'H&amp;#39;ello wor&amp;#177;ld' FROM dual

A desirable result:

I know that regexp_replace should be used, But how do you use this function to remove this text?
","You can use
SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(col,'&amp;&amp;#\d+;')       
  FROM t

where

&amp; is put twice to provide escaping for the substitution character
\d represents digits and the following + provides the multiple occurrences of them
ending the pattern with ;

or just use a single ampersand ('&amp;#\d+;') for the pattern as in the case of Demo , since an ampersand has a special meaning for Oracle, a usage is a bit problematic.
","To remove template text like ""&amp;#x;"" or ""&amp;#xx;"" or ""&amp;#xxx;"" from a long string using the regexp_replace function in Oracle SQL, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the regexp_replace function with the appropriate regular expression pattern and replacement string.
2. The regular expression pattern should match the template text you want to remove. In this case, the pattern should match ""&amp;#"" followed by one or more digits.
3. The replacement string should be an empty string ('') to remove the matched template text.
4. Apply the regexp_replace function to the long string column in your query.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```sql
SELECT regexp_replace('H&amp;#39;ello wor&amp;#177;ld', '&amp;#[0-9]+;', '') AS result FROM dual;
```

The regular expression pattern '&amp;#[0-9]+;' matches the template text ""&amp;#"" followed by one or more digits.
The replacement string is an empty string (''), which effectively removes the matched template text.
The result of the query will be ""Hello world"", without the template text.

Note that the regular expression pattern '[0-9]+' matches one or more digits. If the number can have a specific length, you can modify the pattern accordingly. For example, if the number can only have three digits, you can use '[0-9]{3}' instead.

Also, make sure to replace the column name or variable in the SELECT statement with the appropriate column name from your table that contains the long string.

How can i access that bezierpath drawn in drawRect method so i can change it's position according to touches.
private var bezierPaths: [MyBezierPath] = [MyBezierPath]()

    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {

        path.stroke()
    }
}

    func drawingPath(_ path: [MyBezierPath]) {
    bezierPaths = path

like creating CAShapeLayer and setting layer.path = BezierPath like this :
        let shapeLayer = CAShapeLayer()
        shapeLayer.lineWidth = 1
        shapeLayer.strokeColor = UIColor.black.cgColor

                layer.path = path.cgPath
            }
}

like this i can access layer.path but how can i do it for path drawn in draw(Rect:) method ?
","Depending on what you're actually trying to do, overriding draw(_:) may not be the best approach.
For example, if you want to animate the drawn paths, it will be much easier if you are using CAShapeLayer as sublayers, or using subviews.
Also, shape layers are highly optimized ... if you write your own draw / animate functions you risk ending up with lesser-optimized code.
However, whichever approach you take, to &quot;find the path&quot; you want to use contains(_ point: CGPoint)
For example, if you have an array of UIBezierPath, with all paths relative to the top-left (0,0) of the view, on touch you could do:
// find a path that contains the touch point
if let touchedPath = bezierPaths.first(where: {$0.contains(point)}) {
    // do something with that path
}

If the paths are not relative to the top-left of the view - for example, if the path is relative to the layer position, or is part of a subview - you'd need to convert the touch point.
Here's a quick example that looks like this - on load, and then after dragging a few shapes around:
 
We'll start with a simple &quot;path&quot; struct, which contains the bezier path and the color to use. We could add various other properties, such as line width, dash pattern, etc:
struct MyPath {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

then we'll use this UIView subclass that will handle the drawing, as well as touches began/moved/ended:
class BezDrawView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            setNeedsDisplay()
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        super.draw(rect)
        
        if myPaths.count &gt; 0 {
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                p.color.set()
                p.path.stroke()
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            self.activePath = touchedPath
            self.startPoint = point
            return
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        startPoint = point
        // this triggers draw(_:)
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {

Edit in response to comment...
That needs very few changes to make it work with shape layers instead of draw(_:).
We can use the same Translation Transform to &quot;move&quot; the path, then update the .path property of that path's associated layer:
    let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
    active.path.apply(tr)
    activeLayer.path = activeParh.path.cgPath

I strongly, strongly recommend that you try to convert that sample code to shape layers on your own - it would be a good learning exercise.
But, if you run into trouble, here's a modified version...
First, we're going to use the. array index of the MyPath object to match with the sublayer index, so we need to make our struct Equatable:
struct MyPath: Equatable {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

Then some minor changes to BezDrawView -- which we'll name BezLayerView:
class BezLayerView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            // remove any existing layers
            if let subs = layer.sublayers {
                subs.forEach { lay in
                    lay.removeFromSuperlayer()
                }
            }
            // create layers for paths
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                let lay = CAShapeLayer()
                lay.lineWidth = 4
                lay.lineCap = .round
                lay.lineJoin = .round
                lay.lineDashPattern = [5, 10]
                lay.fillColor = UIColor.clear.cgColor
                lay.strokeColor = p.color.cgColor
                lay.path = p.path.cgPath
                layer.addSublayer(lay)
            }
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activeLayer: CAShapeLayer?
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first, let subs = layer.sublayers else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            // find the layer associated with that path
            if let idx = myPaths.firstIndex(of: touchedPath) {
                if let lay = subs[idx] as? CAShapeLayer {
                    self.activePath = touchedPath
                    self.activeLayer = lay
                    self.startPoint = point
                }
            }
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let lay = activeLayer, let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        lay.path = ap.path.cgPath
        startPoint = point
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // done dragging
        activeLayer = nil
        activePath = nil
    }
    
}

and an almost identical version of the controller:
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground

        var somePaths: [MyPath] = []
        var i: Int = 0
        for (c, r) in zip(colors, rects) {
            var b = UIBezierPath()
            switch i % 4 {
            case 1:     // oval
                b = UIBezierPath(ovalIn: r)

        testBezLayerView.myPaths = somePaths
    }
    
}

The output and functionality should be indistinguishable from the BezDrawView implementation.
","To access the UIBezierPath that is drawn in the `draw(_ rect: CGRect)` method, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a custom subclass of `UIView` and add a property to hold the `UIBezierPath`.

```swift
class CustomView: UIView {
    var bezierPath: UIBezierPath?
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        super.draw(rect)
        
        // Draw the path
        bezierPath?.stroke()
    }
}
```

2. In your view controller, instantiate the `CustomView` and set the `bezierPath` property.

```swift
let customView = CustomView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
let path = UIBezierPath(rect: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
customView.bezierPath = path
```

3. To change the position of the path according to touches, you can override the `touchesMoved` method in your view controller and update the `bezierPath` property.

```swift
override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
    guard let touch = touches.first else { return }
    
    let location = touch.location(in: customView)
    
    // Update the position of the path
    customView.bezierPath?.apply(CGAffineTransform(translationX: location.x, y: location.y))
    
    customView.setNeedsDisplay()
}
```

By updating the `bezierPath` property and calling `setNeedsDisplay()` on the `CustomView`, the path will be redrawn with the updated position.",0.7507702112197876,"swift, uiview, core-graphics, calayer, uibezierpath",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

If it didn't work could you share the config file
","To fix the issue of not being able to clear Laravel migrations due to an invalid database URL configuration, you can follow these steps:

1. Verify the correct database URL: Double-check your Laravel database configuration file (`config/database.php`) and ensure that you have the correct database URL specified. Make sure there are no typos or formatting errors.

2. Clear the config cache manually: Since you mentioned that you cannot clear the cache using the `php artisan config:cache` command, you can manually delete the cached configuration file. Locate the `bootstrap/cache/config.php` file in your Laravel project directory and delete it.

3. Remove the invalid database URL from the config: Ensure that you have removed the incorrect database URL from your Laravel configuration file (`config/database.php` or `.env` file) and save the changes.

4. Run `composer dump-autoload`: This command will regenerate the autoload files and ensure that any changes made to the configuration files are reflected properly.

5. Test artisan commands: Try running `php artisan help` or any other artisan command to see if the issue has been resolved. It should no longer throw the ""The database configuration URL is malformed"" error.

74189852,GitHub Pages absolute_url discrepancy,"I changed my GH Pages Source setting from &quot;classic&quot;/&quot;hands off&quot; to &quot;GitHub Actions (Beta)&quot;, and after some tweaking, everything is working the same again, except for one thing: when hosted on my-subdomain.github.io the link to the home page goes to github.com.
The anchor tag comes from jekyll-theme-primer's default.html layout and looks like this:
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ &quot;/&quot; | absolute_url }}&quot;&gt;

On my local machine (in Docker), this is fine and links to localhost:3000 and previously on GH Pages it linked to my-subdomain.github.io (and I named the repository the same) which was fine, but after the switch it links to github.com which is bad.
My GHA workflow is a straight copy of the official starter workflow which runs this command:
bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl &quot;${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}&quot;

And site.base_url is &quot;&quot; in all cases.
According to the Jekyll docs, absolute_url &quot;prepends url and base_url to the input&quot;. Why is url set to github.com now and what's the best way to fix it?
","I fixed it by adding _config-gh.yml with url set to the correct github.io subdomain and adding --config _config.yml,_config-gh.yml to the workflow command.
","The issue you are facing is related to the change in the GitHub Pages Source setting from ""classic""/""hands off"" to ""GitHub Actions (Beta)"". The problem is that the `absolute_url` filter in Jekyll is now prepending the URL with `github.com` instead of your subdomain.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `baseurl` configuration in your `_config.yml` file. The `baseurl` should be set to your subdomain.

Here's what you can do:

1. Open your `_config.yml` file.
2. Find the line that specifies the `baseurl` configuration.
3. Update the `baseurl` to your subdomain. For example, if your subdomain is `my-subdomain`, the configuration should be `baseurl: ""/my-subdomain""`.
4. Save the changes to the `_config.yml` file.

After making these changes, rebuild your Jekyll site and redeploy it to GitHub Pages. The `absolute_url` filter should now correctly prepend the URL with your subdomain instead of `github.com`.

If you're still facing issues, double-check the configuration in your GitHub Actions workflow file (`main.yml`). Ensure that the `baseurl` is correctly passed to the `bundle exec jekyll build` command using the `--baseurl` flag.

By updating the `baseurl` configuration and ensuring that it is correctly passed to the build command, you should be able to fix the discrepancy in the `absolute_url` behavior and have the link to the home page correctly point to your subdomain on GitHub Pages.",0.6376354694366455,"jekyll, github-pages",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    # DO something
    flag = True
    break

   print(f&quot;Timeout reached {timeout}&quot;)

With the current code, the timeout or the flag are not hit. Any hints of what it is wrong?
","I am going to post the solution that I have found and worked for me as in the #DO SOMETHING section I had some blocks of code that were using some libraries that were in conflict with multithreading public library:
import time

MAX_TIMEOUT = 5

start_time = time.time()
while True:
    time_delta = time.time() - start_time
    while time_delta &lt;= MAX_TIMEOUT:

            break

","The issue in the provided code is with the comparison in the while loop condition. The condition `time.time() < timeout + start_time` is incorrect. 

The `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the epoch, while `timeout + start_time` is a fixed value representing the timeout duration in seconds. Comparing these two values directly will not give you the desired timeout behavior.

To fix this problem, you need to calculate the elapsed time inside the while loop and compare it with the timeout duration. Here's the modified code:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
flag = False
timeout = 5

while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
    # DO something
    flag = True
    break

if flag is False:
   print(f""Timeout reached {timeout}"")
```

In the modified code, the condition inside the while loop is `time.time() - start_time < timeout`, which calculates the elapsed time by subtracting `start_time` from the current time using the `time.time()` function. This condition ensures that the loop exits when the timeout duration is reached.

Additionally, note that the `break` statement inside the loop will make it run only once. If you intend to have a loop that continues until the timeout or flag condition is met, you should remove the `break` statement.",0.6449384689331055,"python, while-loop, timeout",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I have a model with an ImageField. I want to fill it with sample data. This is not  about testing. I just want to fill the database for development purposes. I saved some 50 jpg files and decided to add them programmatically.
I failed miserably. This code blows up with the exception:

","f = open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), &quot;rb&quot;)

should do the trick. If not you can try to add the encoding standard like
f = open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), &quot;rb&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)

But I'm not sure if this even works with bytes, it might only work for &quot;r&quot;.
You should give the file also a name:
sample_img = File(f, img)

If you already have the model created you can slo save the file afterwards with:
phrase = Phrase.objects.get(pk=1)
phrase.upload_to.save(img, content=sample_img))

small edit:
you can faster create a new entry with the following command:
phrase = Phrase.objects.create(
    image=sample_img
)

","The issue you are facing is related to the encoding of the image file. The `UnicodeDecodeError` suggests that there is an attempt to decode a byte sequence as a string using the 'utf-8' codec, which is not valid for image files.

To fix this problem, you can use the `open` function in binary mode by specifying the `rb` mode when opening the file. Here's an updated version of your code:

```python
import os
import random
from django.core.files import File
from django.conf import settings

sample_img_dir = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'doc', 'samples', 'img')
sample_images = os.listdir(sample_img_dir)
img = random.choice(sample_images)
file_path = os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img)
with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
    sample_img = File(f)
    obj = Phrase(image=sample_img)
    obj.save()
```

In this updated code, the image file is opened in binary mode (`rb`) using the `open` function, and then a `File` object is created from the opened file. Finally, the `Phrase` object is created with the `image` field set to the `sample_img` file, and it is saved to the database.

Make sure to replace `Phrase` with the actual name of your model class, and verify that the file path is correct for your sample images.

This should resolve the `UnicodeDecodeError` and allow you to fill your model with sample images successfully.",0.7238191366195679,django,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73669427,I can view httpOnly cookies in browser,"I thought that httpOnly cookies were only available to read in a http request. However, when I open up Firefox dev tools, I can see the cookies' value. Is this normal?
","Yes, that’s normal.you can access the cookies using the devtool.
","No, it is not normal to be able to view httpOnly cookies in the browser's dev tools. The purpose of the httpOnly flag on a cookie is to prevent client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, from accessing the cookie's value. This is done to enhance security and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

If you can view the httpOnly cookies in the browser's dev tools, it may indicate a misconfiguration or a bug in the web server or application. Here are a few potential causes and solutions to this problem:

1. Incorrect server-side configuration: Ensure that the server is properly setting the httpOnly flag for the cookies. Double-check the server-side code responsible for setting the cookies and make sure it includes the httpOnly flag.

2. Browser extension interference: Some browser extensions or add-ons can override or modify the behavior of the dev tools, including the visibility of httpOnly cookies. Try disabling any extensions that might be interfering and see if the issue persists.

3. Browser version or settings: Ensure that you are using an up-to-date version of the browser. Older versions may have bugs or security vulnerabilities that allow access to httpOnly cookies. Additionally, check the browser's settings for any options related to cookie visibility or security and make sure they are properly configured.

4. Cross-site scripting vulnerability: If none of the above solutions work, it's possible that your application has a cross-site scripting vulnerability that is being exploited. In this case, you should conduct a thorough security audit of your application and fix any vulnerabilities found.

It's important to note that while httpOnly cookies should not be accessible to client-side scripts, they can still be visible in the browser's dev tools under the ""Storage"" or ""Application"" tab. However, their values should be inaccessible to JavaScript code executing in the browser's context.

If you are still experiencing issues after trying these solutions, it may be helpful to provide more details about your specific setup, including the versions of the browser and any relevant code snippets, so that I can provide more specific guidance.",0.5863152742385864,"javascript, reactjs, cookies, next.js, web-development-server",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

public class DeliveryWindow {

}

Summation of all three variables happens here in Calculator.java
Here is what I've got so far:
CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator.java
package core.calculator.cartEntry.impl;

import core.aggregate.CartEntry;
import core.aggregate.Fullfillment;
import core.aggregate.StoreDelivery;
import core.calculator.cartEntry.CartEntryCalculator

public class CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator implements CartEntryCalculator{
@Override
public void calculate(final CartEntry cartEntry {
          Optional.of(cartEntry).filter(fulfillment -&gt; Objects.nonNull(fulfillment.getFulfillment())).map(CartEntry::getFulfillment)
            .filter(storeDelivery -&gt; Objects.nonNull(storeDelivery.getStoreDelivery()))
            .map(Fulfillment::getStoreDelivery).filter(deliveryFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(deliveryFee.getCost()))
            .filter(serviceFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(serviceFee.getDeliveryServiceFee()))
            .map(StoreDelivery::getDeliveryWindow).filter(windowFee -&gt; Objects.nonNull(windowFee.getFee()));
}
}

","Since you cannot modify these classes, you will need to rely on each of the getter methods of these classes. And, since all of the needed values are components and subcomponents of the CartEntry class, all you need is create a stream of all the fulfillments and use the getter methods to accumulate the sum of each of these values.
List&lt;CartEntry&gt; entries = List.of(new CartEntry(), new CartEntry());
        
double total =
    entries.stream()
        .mapToDouble(entry -&gt; entry.getTotalDeliveryFee()
            .add(entry.getFulfillment().getStoreDelivery().getCost()
                .add(entry.getFulfillment().getStoreDelivery()
                        .getDeliveryServiceFee().add(entry.getFulfillment()
                        .getStoreDelivery().getDeliveryWindow().getFee())))
            .doubleValue())
        .sum();     

That gathers all the totals from components and subcomponents of the CartEntry class.
One last observation: Since the classes are using annotations to guarantee &quot;not null&quot; objects and for decimal values to have a minimum value of 0.0, my assumption is that the use of Optional is really not needed. All subcomponents of CartEntry appear to be automatically created with a value of 0.0. If that assumption is correct, the above function should work perfectly as is. If the assumption is incorrect, then it will be required to  use Optional.of() and then return 0.0 for null decimal values.
","To fix the problem and add the different variables using .map() and .filter(), you can modify the code as follows:

```java
package core.calculator.cartEntry.impl;

import core.aggregate.CartEntry;
import core.aggregate.Fulfillment;
import core.aggregate.StoreDelivery;
import core.aggregate.DeliveryWindow;
import core.calculator.cartEntry.CartEntryCalculator;

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.Objects;
import java.util.Optional;

public class CartEntryTotalDeliveryFeeCalculator implements CartEntryCalculator {

    @Override
    public void calculate(final CartEntry cartEntry) {
        Optional.ofNullable(cartEntry)
                .map(CartEntry::getFulfillment)
                .map(Fulfillment::getStoreDelivery)
                .ifPresent(storeDelivery -> {
                    BigDecimal cost = storeDelivery.getCost();
                    BigDecimal deliveryServiceFee = storeDelivery.getDeliveryServiceFee();
                    DeliveryWindow deliveryWindow = storeDelivery.getDeliveryWindow();
                    BigDecimal fee = deliveryWindow.getFee();

                    BigDecimal totalDeliveryFee = cost.add(deliveryServiceFee).add(fee);
                    cartEntry.setTotalDeliveryFee(totalDeliveryFee);
                });
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we use Optional.ofNullable() to handle null values safely. We then use .map() to extract the necessary objects from the CartEntry hierarchy. Finally, we use .ifPresent() to perform the calculations and set the totalDeliveryFee in the CartEntry object.

Please note that this code assumes you have appropriate getter and setter methods in the respective classes.",0.6705766916275024,"java, lambda, java-stream, option-type",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","I encourage you to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).
See this Python example.
ADCs means your code is unchanged whether you run it locally or on Google Cloud.
When you test your code off Google Cloud, you can export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json and ADC will use the exported credentials.
When you deploy your code to Google Cloud, ADC obtains the credentials (for the resource that's running the code) from Google's Metadata service.
For example, when you run ADC code on Compute Engine, ADC will obtain the instance's (!) Service Account.
You should try to always use instance|role-specific Service Accounts but the default Compute Engine account is a Service Account too and will work.
Be aware that you'll need to ensure that whatever Service Account(s) is/are used have the correct IAM permissions to access other services.
","To use the service account of a GCP VM instead of a SA JSON file to make API calls using Python, you can make the following changes to your code:

1. Remove the line that specifies the path to the JSON file:
```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(""path to the json file"")
```

2. Replace it with the following code to retrieve the credentials from the Compute Engine metadata server:
```
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
```

3. Update the `discovery.build` function to include the `credentials` parameter:
```
service = discovery.build('cloudresourcemanager', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

Does anyone know how I can find the current target repo.
I also asked my self how I can change the current repo.
","If you mean, find the folder currently open in your workspace, simply hover over the filename of an open file to see the path to it.
If you mean, open up a new folder within the workspace, go to File &gt; Open Folder &gt; Then browse to desired folder.
","In Visual Studio Code, you can easily change the current repository and view the current target repository by following these steps:

1. To view the current target repository, you can check the bottom-left corner of the Visual Studio Code window. There, you will find a section with the name of the currently opened folder or repository. If you have multiple folders or repositories open, you can click on this section to switch between them.

2. To change the current repository, you have a couple of options:

   a. Using the Command Palette: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette. Then, type ""Git: Clone"" and select the ""Git: Clone"" command. Enter the URL of the repository you want to switch to and follow the prompts to clone it. Once the cloning process is complete, the newly cloned repository will become the current one.

   b. Using the File Explorer: In the Visual Studio Code sidebar, click on the ""Explorer"" icon (the one with the folder icon). This will open the File Explorer. From there, you can navigate to the folder or repository you want to switch to. Once you open a file or folder from that repository, it will become the current one.

   c. Opening a folder directly: You can also change the current repository by directly opening a folder in Visual Studio Code. To do this, go to ""File"" in the top menu, select ""Open Folder"", and then navigate to the folder or repository you want to switch to. Once you open it, it will become the current repository.

Remember that Visual Studio Code works with individual folders as repositories. So, if you want to switch to a specific repository, make sure to open the folder containing that repository in Visual Studio Code.",0.3528423011302948,"visual-studio-code, repository, repo",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74204364,Is it OK to use Django development server for single-user applications?,"I'm developing an application that controls some piece of complex hardware and exposes a front-end to the users using Django, mainly for cross-platform and remote access reasons. Currently using Django templates, but soon with a separate front-end through DRF calls. My main points of interest are:

user management. Admin users have more access
session management. Ideally, one cannot login from multiple IPs at the same time.
web-socket support for asynchronous notifications and real-time monitoring.
asynchronous background operations. e.g. with celery workers

Note that the users of these application are the hardware operators which are usually no more than 3-5 tops, and most of the times, only one of them is actively working on it so no real user concurrency, neither real need to scale.
So my question is: Is there a real reason I would want to distribute my application using a production server such as gunicorn instead of simply running manage.py runserver?
","From django runserver documentation:

DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests. (And that’s how it’s gonna stay. We’re in the business of making Web frameworks, not Web servers, so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.)

The development server is not intended for use in production. It is not designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure. It does not support all the possible features of an HTTP server.
In short, python manage.py runserver may work until it breaks!!
","In a single-user application scenario like yours, where the number of users is limited and there is no real need for scalability, it is generally acceptable to use Django's built-in development server (`manage.py runserver`) for testing and development purposes. However, it is not recommended to use it in a production environment.

Here are a few reasons why you should consider using a production server like Gunicorn:

1. Performance: The Django development server is not designed for high-performance production use. It is single-threaded and not optimized for handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently. Gunicorn, on the other hand, is a production-ready server that can handle multiple requests concurrently and is designed for better performance.

2. Security: The Django development server is not intended to be exposed directly to the internet. It lacks some security features that are crucial for protecting your application from potential attacks. Gunicorn, when properly configured, can provide additional security features like handling SSL/TLS encryption, access control, and more.

3. Stability and Reliability: The Django development server is not as robust as production servers like Gunicorn. It may have occasional issues or crashes, and it lacks features like automatic restarts and process management. Gunicorn, when properly configured, can automatically restart your application in case of failures, ensuring better stability and reliability.

4. Deployment Flexibility: Gunicorn provides more deployment options and flexibility. You can easily integrate it with other tools like Nginx for load balancing, caching, and serving static files. It also supports deployment in containerized environments like Docker.

Considering the points above, it is recommended to use Gunicorn or any other production server for deploying your Django application in a production environment. It will provide better performance, security, stability, and deployment flexibility, even if you have a small number of users.",0.7356465458869934,"python, django, django-rest-framework, gunicorn",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

      Type 'T[string]' is not assignable to type 'string | number | symbol'.ts(2322)

","TypeScript is not happy because T[key] could theoratically be a type which is not string, number or symbol.
Imagine this call:
type SortOptions = makeSortOptions&lt;
  {
    albums: &quot;title&quot;
    tracks: &quot;title&quot; | &quot;artist&quot;
    zzz: { a: 123 }
  }
&gt;

It is totally valid to call makeSortOptions with this object, but the zzz property contains an object which can not be used as a key.

I would put the valid Keys in an extra type.
type Keys = &quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;

type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;Keys, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in Keys]: { [value in T[key]]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

Instead of mapping over keyof T (which could lead to non-keyable types), we map over Keys. And through the constraint T extends Record&lt;Keys, string&gt;, TypeScript knows that every key of Keys must lead to a string type.
Playground

You could also just intersect it with a string.
type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;&quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;, string&gt;&gt; = {
  [key in keyof T]: { [value in T[key] &amp; string]: &quot;ascending&quot; | &quot;descending&quot; }
}

Non-string types would then evaluate to never and would not show up in the type.
Playground
","The error you are encountering is due to a limitation in TypeScript's type system when working with mapped types and nested generics. The issue arises because TypeScript cannot guarantee that the values in the `T[key]` union type will be compatible with the keys in the resulting object.

To fix this problem, you can use a type constraint to ensure that the values in the `T[key]` union type are assignable to the keys themselves. Here's an updated version of your code with the necessary changes:

```typescript
type makeSortOptions<T extends Record<""albums"" | ""tracks"", string>> = {
  [key in keyof T]: { [value in T[key] as keyof T]: ""ascending"" | ""descending"" }
}

type SortOptions = makeSortOptions<{
  albums: ""title""
  tracks: ""title"" | ""artist""
}>

const x: SortOptions = {
  albums: { title: ""descending"" },
  tracks: {
    artist: ""descending"",
    title: ""ascending"",
  },
}

const y: SortOptions = {
  albums: { title: ""space and time"" },
  tracks: {
    artist: ""foo"",
    title: ""ascending"",
  },
}
```

By using the `as keyof T` type constraint in the mapped type declaration, we ensure that the values in the `T[key]` union type are compatible with the keys in the resulting object. This resolves the error you were encountering.

Please note that the code provided is a workaround for the current limitations of TypeScript's type system.

","To select a subject from an autocomplete option on the given website, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the website link in a web browser.
2. Inspect the Subject field element using the browser's developer tools. Right-click on the Subject field and select ""Inspect"" or use the shortcut key (e.g., Ctrl + Shift + I in Chrome).
3. Locate the HTML input element for the Subject field in the developer tools.
4. Check if the input element has any attributes or classes that can be used to uniquely identify it. For example, it might have an id, class, or name attribute.
5. Construct an XPath expression to locate the autocomplete options. The XPath should start from the input field and traverse to the autocomplete options.
   - If the input field has an id attribute, you can use it in the XPath expression. For example:
     `//input[@id='subject']//following-sibling::div[contains(@class, 'subjects-auto-complete__menu')]//div[@class='subjects-auto-complete__option']`
   - If the input field has a unique class attribute, you can use it in the XPath expression. For example:
     `//input[@class='subjects-auto-complete__control']//following-sibling::div[contains(@class, 'subjects-auto-complete__menu')]//div[@class='subjects-auto-complete__option']`
   - If the input field does not have any unique attributes, you can try using other attributes or a combination of attributes to construct the XPath expression.
6. Use the constructed XPath expression to locate the autocomplete options and interact with them using Selenium's WebDriver methods. For example, you can use the `find_elements_by_xpath()` method to get a list of all the autocomplete options and then select the desired option by clicking on it.

Here's an example code snippet in Python using Selenium:

```python

# Find the Subject field input element
subject_input = driver.find_element_by_id(""subjectsInput"")

# Click on the Subject field to trigger the autocomplete options
subject_input.click()

# Find the autocomplete options using the constructed XPath expression
autocomplete_options = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(""//input[@id='subjectsInput']//following-sibling::div[contains(@class, 'subjects-auto-complete__menu')]//div[@class='subjects-auto-complete__option']"")

","Can you do something similar with pivot_wider and pivot_longer from the tidyr package? I haven't used the case/melt framework in some time, and I'm wondering if the language has moved away from it.
","The error message you are encountering, ""unimplemented type 'list' in 'listgreater'"", typically occurs when there is an issue with the data types of the variables being used in the cast function in R.

In your case, it seems that the ""Year"" variable is of type character instead of a numeric or integer type. The cast function expects the variables used for grouping (in this case, ""Year"") to be of a suitable type for sorting and comparison operations.

To fix this issue, you can convert the ""Year"" variable to a numeric or integer type before using it in the cast function. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```R
# Convert the ""Year"" variable to numeric
pMaster$Year <- as.numeric(pMaster$Year)

# Now, you can use the cast function
cast(pMaster, Year ~ result, value = ""PopVotes"", fun.aggregate = sum)
```

By converting the ""Year"" variable to a numeric type, you should be able to successfully cast the dataframe without encountering the ""unimplemented type 'list' in 'listgreater'"" error.

73235410,How do server programs work on Docker when *only* the listening port is mapped to the Docker host?,"This is just a conceptual question that I have been thinking about recently.
Say I'm running an Nginx container on Docker on a host. Normally, for this to work, we have to map ports like 80 and 443 to host container. This is because these are listening ports, and connections from the outside world to port 80 should be forwarded to port 80 of the container. So far so good.
But also: port 80 is just the listening socket, right? The listening socket only accepts the connection; after this any communication done between a client and the Nginx server is supposedly done on a different socket with a random port number (on the server side). This is to allow multiple connections, and to keep the listening port free to establish more connections, etc. This is where my issue comes in.
Say I'm a client and I connect to this Nginx server. As far as I understand, I first send TCP packets to port 80 of the host that is hosting this Nginx Docker container. But during the establishment of the connection, the server changes their port to another number, say 45670. (Not sure how, but I am guessing the packets that are sent back suddenly mention this port, and our client will continue the rest of the exchange with this port number instead).
But now as I send packets (e.g. HTTP requests) to the host on port 45670, how will the Nginx docker container see those packets?
I am struggling to understand how server processes can run on Docker with only one port exposed / published for mapping.
Thanks!
","
But also: port 80 is just the listening socket, right? The listening socket only accepts the connection; after this any communication done between a client and the Nginx server is supposedly done on a different socket with a random port number (on the server side).

Nope. When a connection is established, the client side is a random port number (usually) and the server side is the same port that the server listens on.
In TCP there aren't actually listening sockets - they're an operating system thing - and a connection is identified by the combination of both the port numbers and both the IP addresses. The client sends a SYN (&quot;new connection please&quot;) from its port 49621 (for example) to port 80 on the server; the server sends a SYN/ACK (&quot;okay&quot;) from its port 80 to port 49621 on the client.
","When running server programs on Docker with only the listening port mapped to the Docker host, you need to understand how Docker networking works.

By default, Docker uses a bridge networking mode, which creates a virtual network interface (bridge) on the host machine. When you start a container, Docker assigns an IP address to it on the bridge network. The container can then listen on ports within its own network namespace.

When you map a port from the container to the host using the `-p` or `--publish` flag in Docker, it creates a port forwarding rule that forwards traffic from the specified port on the host to the corresponding port on the container.

In the case of Nginx running in a Docker container, you would typically map port 80 or 443 on the host to port 80 or 443 on the container. This allows incoming connections to reach the Nginx container.

Now, regarding the issue you mentioned about the server changing the port number after the initial connection establishment, this is not how TCP works. Once a TCP connection is established, the source and destination ports remain the same throughout the lifetime of the connection. The server does not change its port number for subsequent communication with the client.

When a client sends packets to the host on the mapped port (e.g., port 80), Docker's port forwarding rule ensures that the packets are forwarded to the corresponding port on the container (also port 80 in this case). The Nginx server running inside the container will receive these packets and process them as expected.

In summary, the mapping of the listening port from the container to the host allows incoming connections to reach the container. Once the initial connection is established, subsequent communication between the client and the server happens on the same port, and Docker's port forwarding ensures that the packets are correctly routed to the container.",0.6767330169677734,"docker, sockets, nginx",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74234235,How to do SQL Server date formatting,"I am preparing a query on sql server. But I'm stuck with the date format.
I want the date format to be at the bottom. If there are letters in it, I don't want it to appear. The ISDATE command only accepts the EN date format.
I want to write it as digit2/digit2/digit4 like alt.
SELECT TOP 4  * FROM A AS T WHERE 1 = 1 AND ISNUMERIC(T.Id) = 1


11111111111 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 19.10.1965
11111111111 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 15.8.1980
11111111111 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 12.8.2015
11111111111 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 3.3.1967

","ISDATE is the wrong approach here because it only supports a narrow range of formats and relies on the regional/language settings of the caller, e.g.:
SELECT ISDATE('19.10.1965'), -- 0
       ISDATE('10.19.1965'); -- 1

SET LANGUAGE Türkçe;

SELECT ISDATE('19.10.1965'), -- 1
       ISDATE('10.19.1965'); -- 0

Trying to match a pattern like digit2/digit2/digit4 is also the wrong approach, since it will allow &quot;dates&quot; like 31/02/3456 and 99/99/0000.
Try:
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(date, '19.10.1965', 104);

As a filter:
... WHERE TRY_CONVERT(date, date_column, 104) IS NOT NULL;

Also I would stay away from PARSE/TRY_PARSE/FORMAT as the CLR overhead can be substantial.
","To fix the date format issue in your SQL Server query, you can use the CONVERT function to format the date as desired. Here's an example of how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT TOP 4 *,
    CONVERT(varchar(10), CAST(SUBSTRING(T.DateColumn, 1, CHARINDEX(' ', T.DateColumn) - 1) AS date), 103) AS FormattedDate
FROM A AS T
WHERE 1 = 1
    AND ISNUMERIC(T.Id) = 1
    AND ISDATE(SUBSTRING(T.DateColumn, 1, CHARINDEX(' ', T.DateColumn) - 1)) = 1
```

In this modified query, the `CONVERT` function is used to convert the date in the `DateColumn` to the desired format using the `103` style code which represents `dd/mm/yyyy`. The `SUBSTRING` function is used to extract the date portion from the `DateColumn`, and the `ISDATE` function is used to validate if the extracted date is in a valid format.

Make sure to replace `T.DateColumn` with the actual column name that contains your date data. The `FormattedDate` column in the result will have the date formatted as `dd/mm/yyyy`.

Note that the `ISNUMERIC(T.Id) = 1` condition is used to filter out rows where the `Id` column is not numeric.",0.5119807124137878,"sql, sql-server, regex, regexp-replace",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

type X = Flatten&lt;TestInterface&gt;

Playground
","To flatten the ""body"" wrapper in the nested objects while maintaining the structure, you can use TypeScript mapped types and recursive conditional types.

Here's an example solution:

```typescript
type FlattenBody<T> = T extends object
  ? {
      [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends { body: infer B }
        ? FlattenBody<B>
        : FlattenBody<T[K]>
    }
  : T;

type FlattenedTestInterface = FlattenBody<TestInterface>;
```

In this solution, we define a generic type `FlattenBody` that takes a type `T`. We use conditional types to check if each property of `T` has a nested `body` property. If it does, we recursively call `FlattenBody` on the `body` property and assign it to the property in the flattened type. If the property does not have a `body` property, we recursively call `FlattenBody` on the property itself.

By applying this `FlattenBody` type to `TestInterface`, we can obtain the desired flattened type `FlattenedTestInterface`.

Here's the updated type with the desired output:

```typescript
type FlattenedTestInterface = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  something: string;
  user: {
    id: string;
    firstname: string;
    lastname: string;
    age: number;
  };
  country: {
    id: string;
    code: string;
    name: string;
    region: {
      id: string;
      code: string;
      name: string;
      continent: {
        id: string;
        code: string;
        name: string;
      };
    };
  };
};
```

You can now use `FlattenedTestInterface` as the transformed type in your TypeScript code.",0.7367669343948364,"typescript, typescript-typings, typescript-generics, flatten, infinite-recursion",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","The ColorEditor you're showing is the Qt Design Studio custom ColorEditor for the PropertyEditor. This was a change made in QtDS 2.2 release.
The first image is showing the integrated minimal color editor in the PropertyEditor, the second one is showing the old (pre QtDS 2.2) ColorEditor that needed a complete section. The decision was made that it needed a slimmer version of the ColorEditor and the full ColorEditor on demand. The third image is showing the new full ColorEditor of QtDS.
You can get the operation system ColorDialog in the new version of the QtDS ColorEditor by right-clicking on the ColorPicker in the full ColorEditor and choosing &quot;Open Color Dialog&quot; from the context menu.

","To change the default Color picker in Qt Creator, you need to modify the preferences of the IDE. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open Qt Creator and go to the ""Tools"" menu.
2. Select ""Options"" from the dropdown menu. This will open the Preferences dialog.
3. In the left sidebar of the Preferences dialog, navigate to ""Text Editor"" and then ""Display"".
4. Under the ""Display"" section, you will find the ""Color picker"" option. By default, it is set to ""System color picker"".
5. Click on the dropdown menu next to ""Color picker"" and select ""Custom color picker"".
6. After selecting ""Custom color picker"", you will see a ""Configure"" button appear. Click on it.
7. In the ""Configure Color Picker"" dialog, you can choose the color picker you prefer. You can select the ""Standard Color Dialog"" or any other custom color picker you have installed on your system.
8. Once you have selected your preferred color picker, click ""OK"" to save the changes.
9. Close the Preferences dialog.

Now, when you click on the ""Color"" option in the properties panel, the new color picker you selected will be used. Similarly, when you double-click on an object within the design window, the same color picker will be used.

Please note that the steps provided above are based on Qt Creator 8.0.1. The location of the preferences may vary slightly in different versions of Qt Creator, but the overall process should be similar.",0.6012948155403137,"qt, ide, preferences",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

74433987,python concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor crashing with full RAM,"Python concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor crashing with full RAM
Program description
Hi, I've got a computationally heavy function which I want to run in parallel. The function is a test that accepts as inputs:

a DataFrame to test on
parameters based on which the calculations will be ran.

The return value is a short list of calculation results.
I want to run the same function in a for loop with different parameters and the same input DataFrame, basically run a brute-force to find optimal parameters for my problem.
The code I've written
I currently am running the code concurrently with ProcessPoolExecutor from the module concurrent.futures.
import concurrent.futures
from itertools import repeat
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]
large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for future in executor.map(func, repeat(large_df.copy()), parameters):
        test_result = future.result()
        ...

The problem
The problem I face is that I need to run a large amount of iterations, but my program crashes almost instantly.
In on order for it not to crash, I need to limit it to max 4 workers, which is 1/4 of my CPU resources.
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    ...

I figured out my program crashes due to a full RAM (16 GB). What I found weird is that when I was running it on more workers, it was gradually eating more and more RAM, which it never released, until it crashed.
Instead of passing a copy of the DataFrame, I tried to pass the file path, but apart of slowing down my program, it didn't change anything.
Do you have any idea of why that problem occurs and how to solve it?
","See my comment on what map actually returns.
This answer is relevant according to how large your parameters list is, i.e. how many total tasks are being placed on the multiprocessing pool's task queue:
You are currently creating and passing a copy of your dataframe (with large_df.copy()) every time you are submitting a new task (one task for each element of parameters. One thing you can do is to initialize your pool processes once with a single copy per pool process that will be used by every task submitted and executed by the pool process.  The assumption is that the dataframe itself is not modified by my_tests.func. If it is modified and you need a copy of the original large_df for each new task, the function worker (see below) can make the copy. In this case you would need 2 * N copies (instead of just N copies) to exist simultaneously where N is the number of processes in the pool. This will save you memory if the length of parameters is greater than that since in your code a copy of the dataframe will exist either on the task queue or in a pool process's address space.
If you are running under a platform such as Linux that uses the fork method to create new processes, then each child process will inherit a copy automatcally as a global variable:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]

large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited

def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):
        ...

my_tests.func is expecting as its first argument a dataframe, but with the above change the dataframe is no longer being passed; the dataframe is now accessed as a global variable. So without modifying func, we need am adapter function, worker, that will pass to func what it is expecting. Of course, if you are able to modify func, then you can do without the adapter.
If you were running on a platform such as Windows that uses the spawn method to create new processes, then:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func

def init_pool_processes(df):
    global large_df
    large_df = df


def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    parameters = [
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        ...
    ]
    
    large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited
    
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(initializer=init_pool_processes, initargs=(large_df,)) as executor:
        for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):
            ...

","The issue you are facing with the `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` crashing due to full RAM is likely caused by the large DataFrame being passed as an argument to the `func` function in each iteration. Since each process in the process pool receives a copy of the DataFrame, it can lead to a significant increase in memory usage.

To address this problem, you can try the following approaches:

1. Reduce memory usage:
   - Instead of passing a copy of the DataFrame to each process, you can try passing only the necessary data required for the calculations. This can be achieved by selecting specific columns or creating a smaller subset of the DataFrame that contains the required information.
   - If possible, try to optimize the memory usage within the `func` function itself. For example, if you are creating temporary variables or intermediate results, ensure that you are releasing the memory after their use.

2. Process data in chunks:
   - Instead of passing the entire DataFrame to each process, you can divide the data into smaller chunks and process them separately. This way, the memory usage will be limited to the size of each chunk.
   - You can use the `numpy.array_split` or `pandas.DataFrame.groupby` function to split the DataFrame into chunks and then process each chunk separately in the `func` function.

3. Use a shared memory approach:
   - Instead of passing copies of the DataFrame to each process, you can consider using a shared memory approach. This allows multiple processes to access the same memory space, reducing the memory overhead.
   - You can use libraries like `multiprocessing.shared_memory` or `multiprocessing.Array` to create shared memory objects and pass them as arguments to the `func` function. However, be aware that this approach requires careful synchronization and handling of shared resources.

4. Use a different parallelization approach:
   - If the above approaches don't solve the issue, you can consider using a different parallelization approach, such as `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `joblib.Parallel`. These approaches use threads instead of processes, which can have lower memory overhead.

It's important to note that the best approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your problem. You may need to experiment with different techniques to find the optimal solution for your use case.",0.705579936504364,"python, multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, process-pool",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73315006,Trying to separate bars in two overlayed bar charts in ggplot,"I am trying to create a single chart from two created bar charts to show the differences in their distribution. I have both charts merging together, and the axis labels are correct. However, I cannot figure out how to get the bars in each section to be next to each other for comparison instead of overlaying. Data for this chart are two variables within the same DF. I am relatively new to r and new to ggplot so even plotting what I have was a challenge. Please be kind and I apologize if this is a question that has been answered before.
Here is the code I am using:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  geom_bar(aes(x=AgeFactor,fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=FdgFactor,fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width=.6)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(&quot;0-6months&quot;,&quot;7-12months&quot;,&quot;1-1.99&quot;,&quot;2-2.99&quot;,&quot;3-3.99&quot;,&quot;4-4.99&quot;,&quot;5-5.99&quot;,&quot;6-6.99&quot;,&quot;7-7.99&quot;,&quot;8-8.99&quot;,&quot;9-9.99&quot;,&quot;10-10.99&quot;))+
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)

and this is the graph it is creating for me:

I really appreciate any insight. This is my first time asking a question on stack too - so I am happy to edit/adjust info as needed.
","The issue is that you plot from different columns of your dataset. To dodge your bars position_dodge requires a column to group the data by. To this end you could reshape your data to long format using e.g. tidyr::pivot_longer so that your two columns are stacked on top of each other and you get a new column containing the column or group names as categories.
Using some fake random example data. First I replicate your issue with this data and your code:
set.seed(123)

levels &lt;- c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)

Graph &lt;- data.frame(
  AgeFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  FdgFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  lab = 1:100
)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(NULL, aes(lab), position_dodge(.5)) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = .6) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)) +
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)


And now the fix using reshaping. Additionally I simplified your code a bit:

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

Graph_long &lt;- Graph %&gt;%
  select(AgeFactor, FdgFactor) %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(c(AgeFactor, FdgFactor))
  
ggplot(Graph_long, aes(x = value, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(&quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;, &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = levels) +
  labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = &quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))


","To fix the problem of overlaying bars in your ggplot chart, you need to modify the position of the bars using the `position` argument in the `geom_bar()` function. In your code, you are using the `position_dodge(.5)` function, but it is not applied correctly.

To separate the bars in each section, you need to specify the `position = ""dodge""` argument within each `geom_bar()` function. Here's the modified code:

```R
Labeled <- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab)) +
  ggtitle(""Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges"") +
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = ""Age of Autism Diagnosis""), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.4, position = ""dodge"") +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = ""Feeding Challenge Onset""), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.4, position = ""dodge"") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(""0-6months"", ""7-12months"", ""1-1.99"", ""2-2.99"", ""3-3.99"", ""4-4.99"", ""5-5.99"", ""6-6.99"", ""7-7.99"", ""8-8.99"", ""9-9.99"", ""10-10.99"")) +
  xlab(""Age"") +
  ylab("""") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = """")

```

In the modified code, I changed the width of the bars to 0.4 to allow them to be closer together. Additionally, I added the `position = ""dodge""` argument to both `geom_bar()` functions.

This should separate the bars in each section and allow for better comparison between the two variables.",0.6277142763137817,"r, ggplot2",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

And check this issue if the issue still continues after adding the role.
","The error message you're encountering indicates that the authentication method you're using with Terraform is not supported by the billingbudgets.googleapis.com API. To resolve this issue, you'll need to configure the authentication method correctly.

Here are the steps you can follow to fix the problem:

1. Create a service account: Go to the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the IAM & Admin page, and create a new service account. Assign the required roles (e.g., Billing Account Administrator) to the service account.

2. Generate a key for the service account: Once the service account is created, generate a key file (in JSON format) for the service account. This key file will be used for authentication.

3. Configure Terraform to use the service account: In your Terraform configuration, update the provider block for Google Cloud Platform to include the service account key file path. Here's an example:

```hcl
provider ""google"" {
  credentials = file(""<path-to-service-account-key-file>"")
}
```

Replace `<path-to-service-account-key-file>` with the actual path to the JSON key file you generated in step 2.

4. Apply the Terraform configuration: Run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply` to apply the Terraform configuration and create the billing budget.

By configuring Terraform to use the service account key file, you'll be authenticating with the appropriate credentials supported by the billingbudgets.googleapis.com API. This should resolve the 403 error you're facing.

73185851,GNU memmem vs C strstr,"Is there any use case that can be solved by memmem but not by strstr?
I was thinking of able to parse a string raw bytes (needle) inside a bigger string of raw bytes(haystack). Like trying to find a particular raw byte pattern inside a blob of raw bytes read from C's read function.
","There is the case you mention: raw binary data.
This is because raw binary data may contain zeroes, which are interpreted and string terminator by strstr, making it ignore the rest of the haystack or needle.
Additionally, if the raw binary data contains no zero bytes, and you don't have a valid (inside the same array or buffer allocation) extra zero after the binary data, then strstr will happily go beyond the data and cause Undefined Behavior via buffer overflow.

Or, to the point: strstr can't be used if the data is not strings. memmem doesn't have this limitation.
","The problem you mentioned involves comparing the use cases of `memmem` and `strstr` in C. Both functions are commonly used for string searching, but there are some differences between them.

`memmem` is a GNU extension and is not available in standard C libraries. It allows you to search for a specific byte pattern (needle) within a larger byte array (haystack). This is useful when you have raw byte data and want to find a specific sequence of bytes within it. `memmem` takes the needle and haystack as arguments and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the needle within the haystack. If no match is found, it returns NULL.

On the other hand, `strstr` is a standard C library function that searches for a substring (needle) within a larger string (haystack). It works with null-terminated character arrays and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the needle within the haystack. If no match is found, it returns NULL.

In terms of use cases, `memmem` is more suited for searching raw byte patterns within a byte array. This is commonly used in scenarios where you are dealing with binary data or non-null terminated strings. For example, if you have a file or network packet represented as a byte array, `memmem` can be used to search for specific byte patterns within it.

On the other hand, `strstr` is better suited for searching regular strings within null-terminated character arrays. It is commonly used for searching text-based data, such as searching for words or phrases within a sentence or paragraph.

To fix your problem of searching for a particular raw byte pattern inside a blob of raw bytes read from C's `read` function, you can use `memmem`. Since the data read from `read` is typically stored as a byte array, `memmem` allows you to search for specific byte patterns within that array.

In conclusion, while both `memmem` and `strstr` are useful for string searching, `memmem` is specifically designed for searching raw byte patterns within byte arrays, making it more suitable for your use case.",0.6659761071205139,c,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Per @jasonharper's comment above, CTkButton is

self.ecdpower.text

The same can be applied with fg_color; use self.ecdpower.fg_color to get the value.
","The error you are encountering is because you are trying to access the ""text"" property of the custom button widget using the indexing syntax, which is incorrect. To access the ""text"" property of the button widget, you should use the `cget` method instead.

","To extract the ""Sample Start"" value from the Sampler result tab in JMeter, you can use JMeter's built-in Post-Processor called Regular Expression Extractor. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add a Regular Expression Extractor as a child of the sampler you want to extract the value from.
2. Configure the Regular Expression Extractor as follows:
   - Field to check: Choose ""Response Data"" from the dropdown list.
   - Reference Name: Give a variable name to store the extracted value, e.g., ""sampleStart"".
   - Regular Expression: Use the following regular expression to match the ""Sample Start"" value: `Sample Start:(.*?) IST`.
   - Template: Set it to `$1$`.
   - Match No: Set it to `1`.
   - Default Value: Leave it blank.
3. Save the changes and run your test plan.

After running the test plan, the ""Sample Start"" value will be extracted and stored in the variable you specified (in this case, ""sampleStart""). You can use this variable in subsequent requests or log it in the JMeter log file using a Sampler or a Listener.

Note: Make sure to adjust the regular expression pattern if the format of the ""Sample Start"" value changes in your specific case.",0.6636112332344055,"jmeter, jmeter-plugins, jmeter-5.0",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74472565,Which data type to use for different configurations,"I have a 4 different configurations to be used and these configuration values are stored in a property file. The properties for all the configurations are same, but the values are different for each.
Ex:
The property file configurations I am using:
####Config1####
conf1.password=admin
conf1.username=admin
conf1.context=123
conf1.name=localhost

####config2####
conf2.username=app
conf2.password=app
conf2.context=com
conf2.name=localhost

####config3####
conf3.username=app
conf3.password=app
conf3.context=com
conf3.name=localhost

####config4####
conf4.username=app
conf4.password=app
conf4.context=com
conf4.name=localhost


I can get the properties from the property file. Is it possible to have a single variable to store these values based on configuration and access them in an optimised and readable way?
I tried using hash-map for every configuration separately and fetching it from that. But it is increasing my code redundancy as if I perform same steps for every configuration and if-elsed the configuration name to get the hashmap values.
Currently I am using the properties with hashmap like this:
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf1 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf2 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conf3 = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

conf1.put(&quot;UserName&quot;, prop.getProperty(“conf1.username&quot;));
conf1.put(&quot;Password&quot;,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf1.password&quot;));
conf1.put(“name”,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf1.name&quot;));
conf1.put(&quot;context”,”conf1,context”);

conf2.put(&quot;UserName&quot;, prop.getProperty(“conf2.username&quot;));
conf2.put(&quot;Password&quot;,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf2.password&quot;));
conf2.put(“name”,prop.getProperty(&quot;conf2.name&quot;));
conf2.put(&quot;context”,”conf2,context”);

conf3...
conf4...

if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(“conf1”)) {

          &quot;Name:“ + conf1.get(&quot;Name&quot;) + “-UserName:” +
          conf1.get(&quot;UserName&quot;) + “-Password:” + conf1.get(&quot;Password&quot;) + 
        &quot;-Context:” + conf1.get(“Context”) ,FileName);
} else if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(“conf2”)) {
GenerateTestFile(

          conf2.get(&quot;UserName&quot;) + “-Password:” + conf2.get(&quot;Password&quot;) + 
        &quot;-Context:” + conf2.get(“Context”) ,FileName);
}
Else if(conf3){…}
Else if(conf4){…}


","You could use a Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; where the key is the name of the configuration, and the value (Map&lt;String,String&gt;) is the configuration parameters.
To load the file, you would do something like this:
private static Pattern RE = Pattern.compile(
        &quot;([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)\\.([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)&quot;);

private static Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; loadConfs(String name)
        throws IOException {
    Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; confs = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    Properties props = new Properties();
    ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    try (InputStream in = cl.getResourceAsStream(name)) {
        props.load(in);
    }
    for (String propName: props.stringPropertyNames()) {
        Matcher matcher = RE.matcher(propName);
        if (matcher.matches()) {
            String confName = matcher.group(1);
            String parmName = matcher.group(2);
            Map&lt;String,String&gt; conf = confs.get(confName);
            if (conf == null) {
                conf = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
                confs.put(confName, conf);
            }
            conf.put(parmName, props.getProperty(propName));
        }
    }
    return confs;
}

You could then do something like this:
Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; confs = loadConfs(&quot;conf.properties&quot;);
...
Map&lt;String,String&gt; conf = confs.get(confName);
if (conf != null) {
    GenerateTestFile(
            &quot;Name:“ + conf.get(&quot;Name&quot;)
            + “-UserName:” + conf.get(&quot;UserName&quot;)
            + “-Password:” + conf.get(&quot;Password&quot;)
            + &quot;-Context:” + conf.get(“Context”),
            FileName);
}

","To optimize and make the code more readable, you can use a single HashMap to store the configurations. Here's how you can modify your code:

```java
HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>> configurations = new HashMap<>();

HashMap<String, String> conf1 = new HashMap<>();
conf1.put(""UserName"", prop.getProperty(""conf1.username""));
conf1.put(""Password"", prop.getProperty(""conf1.password""));
conf1.put(""name"", prop.getProperty(""conf1.name""));
conf1.put(""context"", prop.getProperty(""conf1.context""));
configurations.put(""conf1"", conf1);

HashMap<String, String> conf2 = new HashMap<>();
conf2.put(""UserName"", prop.getProperty(""conf2.username""));
conf2.put(""Password"", prop.getProperty(""conf2.password""));
conf2.put(""name"", prop.getProperty(""conf2.name""));
conf2.put(""context"", prop.getProperty(""conf2.context""));
configurations.put(""conf2"", conf2);

HashMap<String, String> conf3 = new HashMap<>();
conf3.put(""UserName"", prop.getProperty(""conf3.username""));
conf3.put(""Password"", prop.getProperty(""conf3.password""));
conf3.put(""name"", prop.getProperty(""conf3.name""));
conf3.put(""context"", prop.getProperty(""conf3.context""));
configurations.put(""conf3"", conf3);

HashMap<String, String> conf4 = new HashMap<>();
conf4.put(""UserName"", prop.getProperty(""conf4.username""));
conf4.put(""Password"", prop.getProperty(""conf4.password""));
conf4.put(""name"", prop.getProperty(""conf4.name""));
conf4.put(""context"", prop.getProperty(""conf4.context""));
configurations.put(""conf4"", conf4);
```

Now, instead of using multiple if-else statements, you can access the configuration values using the configuration name directly:

```java
if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(""conf1"")) {
    HashMap<String, String> config = configurations.get(""conf1"");
    GenerateTestFile(
        ""Name: "" + config.get(""name"") + ""-UserName: "" +
        config.get(""UserName"") + ""-Password: "" + config.get(""Password"") + 
        ""-Context: "" + config.get(""context""), FileName);
} else if (Conf.equalsIgnoreCase(""conf2"")) {
    HashMap<String, String> config = configurations.get(""conf2"");
    GenerateTestFile(
        ""Name: "" + config.get(""name"") + ""-UserName: "" +
        config.get(""UserName"") + ""-Password: "" + config.get(""Password"") + 
        ""-Context: "" + config.get(""context""), FileName);
}
// Repeat the if-else block for conf3 and conf4
```

By organizing the configurations in a single HashMap, you reduce code redundancy and make it easier to access the configuration values based on the configuration name.",0.6562215089797974,"java, properties-file",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74575521,Rename Azure Storage Table Column,"As the title says, is it possible to rename an Azure Storage Table column?
I tried using the portal and through storage explorer with no results
","Hmm.. Haven't had to do this before. But if I had to make a guess, it's that columns don't really exist in table storage. There is no schema anyway, you can include whatever fields in the objects. To rename a column, you'd probably have to go through all the objects and rename the field in them.
","Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly rename an Azure Storage Table column. The Azure Storage Table service does not support altering the schema of an existing table column.

To rename a column, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a new table with the desired schema: Create a new table with the updated column name and the required schema using the Azure Storage SDK or any other supported tool.

2. Copy data from the old table to the new table: Iterate through each entity in the old table, copy the data to the corresponding entity in the new table, and delete the entity from the old table. This process can be automated using code or scripts.

3. Update your application: Modify your application code to use the new table and column names. Ensure that any queries or operations that reference the old column are updated to use the new column name.

4. Delete the old table: Once you have verified that the data has been successfully migrated to the new table and your application is working correctly, you can delete the old table.

It is important to note that renaming a column in Azure Storage Table can be a time-consuming process, especially if you have a large amount of data. Additionally, during the migration process, you may experience downtime or temporary inconsistencies in your data. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully plan and test the migration process before applying it to your production environment.",0.7327157855033875,"azure, azure-table-storage",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73102008,How to convert a dictionary with a tuple inside of a nested list?,"I'm trying to create a bigram from a dictionary with a specific condition. Below is the example of the dictionary:
dict_example = {'keywords1': ['africa',
  'basic service',
  'class',
  'develop country',
  'disadvantage',
  'economic resource',
  'social protection system']

The specific condition is that I want to create a bigram if the words in each element are more than 1. Below is the code that I have been working on so far:
keywords_bigram_temp = {}
keywords_bigram = {}
for k, v in dict_example.items():
    keywords_bigram_temp.update({k: [word_tokenize(w) for w in v]})
    for k2, v2 in keywords_bigram_temp.items():
        keywords_bigram.update({k2: [list(nltk.bigrams(v3)) for v3 in v2 if len(v3) &gt; 1]})

This code works, but instead of returning a normal tuple within a list (I think this is what bigram normally looked like), it returns a tuple within a nested list. Below is an example of the result:
'keywords1': [[('basic', 'service')],
  [('develop', 'country')],
  [('economic', 'resource')],
  [('social', 'protection'),
   ('social', 'system'),
   ('protection', 'system'),
   ('social', 'protection')]}

What I need is a normal bigram structure, a tuple within a list like so:
'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'),
  ('develop', 'country'),
  ('economic', 'resource'),
  ('social', 'protection'),
  ('protection', 'system')]}

","Here's a way to do what your question asks using itertools.combinations():
from itertools import combinations
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2)]}

Output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('social', 'system'), ('protection', 'system')]}

Explanation:

in the dict comprehension, use for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem to iterate over all items in the list associated with keywords1 that contain a ' ' character, meaning the words in the element number more than 1
use the nested loop for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2) to include every unique combination of 2 words within the multi-word item

UPDATE:
Based on OP's clarification that original question contained an extra entry,  and that what is required is &quot;in a 'a b c d' context, it will become ('a','b'),('b','c'),('c','d')&quot;, here are three alternative solutions.
Solution #1 using walrus operator := and dict comprehension:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if len(words := elem.split()) &gt; 1 for x in zip(words, words[1:])]}

Solution #2 using a long-hand for loop:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        keywords_bigram['keywords1'].extend(zip(words, words[1:]))

Solution #3 without zip():
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            keywords_bigram['keywords1'].append(tuple(words[i:i+2]))

All three solutions give identical output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('protection', 'system')]}

","To fix the issue and convert the nested list of tuples into a normal bigram structure (a tuple within a list), you can modify the code as follows:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

dict_example = {'keywords1': ['africa',
                              'basic service',
                              'class',
                              'develop country',
                              'disadvantage',
                              'economic resource',
                              'social protection system']}

keywords_bigram = {}

for k, v in dict_example.items():
    keywords_bigram[k] = []
    for word in v:
        tokenized_words = word_tokenize(word)
        if len(tokenized_words) > 1:
            bigrams = list(nltk.bigrams(tokenized_words))
            keywords_bigram[k].extend(bigrams)

print(keywords_bigram)
```

In this code, I have made the following modifications:

1. Removed the `keywords_bigram_temp` dictionary as it is not necessary.
2. Created an empty list for each key in `keywords_bigram` before processing the words.
3. Tokenized each word using `word_tokenize` from NLTK.
4. Checked if the length of the tokenized words is greater than 1.
5. If the condition is met, generated the bigrams using `nltk.bigrams` and extended the bigrams list for the specific key.

This modified code will produce the desired result, where each key in `keywords_bigram` will have a list of bigrams as tuples within a list.",0.7524318695068359,"python, nltk",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To dynamically convert dataframe columns to a map in PySpark, you can use the following approach:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import collect_list, create_map, lit
from pyspark.sql import Window
```

2. Define a list that contains all the column names except the key_column:
```python
columns = df.columns[1:]
```

3. Use the `collect_list` function to collect all the values for each column into a list, grouping by the key_column:
```python
grouped_df = df.groupby(""key_column"").agg(*[collect_list(col).alias(col) for col in columns])
```

4. Create a window specification to partition the dataframe by the key_column:
```python
window_spec = Window.partitionBy(""key_column"")
```

5. Iterate over the columns and use the `create_map` function to create a map for each column, concatenating the values with a comma:
```python
map_exprs = [create_map(lit(col), grouped_df[col].over(window_spec)).alias(col) for col in columns]
```

6. Select the key_column and the map expressions, and drop any duplicates:
```python
output_df = grouped_df.select(""key_column"", *map_exprs).drop_duplicates()
```

7. The resulting dataframe will have the key_column and a Map_output column containing the dynamic mapping. You can rename the Map_output column if desired:
```python
output_df = output_df.withColumnRenamed(""Map_output"", ""Map_output"")
```

8. Finally, you can show the output dataframe:
```python
output_df.show()
```

The output dataframe will have the key_column and a Map_output column, where each row represents a key and the corresponding dynamic mapping of column names and their values.

Note: Make sure to replace `df` with the actual name of your input dataframe in the code snippet above.",0.6278582215309143,"apache-spark, dictionary, pyspark, dynamic, multiple-columns",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Explanation

^ Start of string

27: Match literally
(4[5-9]|5[0-9]) Match 45 - 49 or 50 - 59
| Or
28:00 Match literally


) Close the group

","To grep log within a specific time range, you can make use of regular expressions in combination with the `grep` command. In your case, you have successfully managed to grep log between 13:27 - 13:28 using the following command:

```
grep '^13:2[7-8]' logfilename
```

To grep log between 13:27:45 - 13:28:00, you can modify the regular expression slightly to match the specific time range. Here's an example command to achieve that:

```
grep '^13:2[7-8]:[45-59]|^13:28:00' logfilename
```

In this updated command, we've added `:[45-59]` to match the seconds between 45 and 59. Additionally, we've included `|^13:28:00` to match exactly 13:28:00 as well.

Regarding using `sed` or `awk` for this operation, it depends on your specific needs and preferences. Both `sed` and `awk` are powerful text processing tools that can manipulate and filter log files. If you require more complex operations or transformations on the log data, `sed` or `awk` might be more suitable.

","To filter values in one dataframe based on array values in another dataframe using pyspark, you can use the `join` operation between the two dataframes. Here's how you can achieve the desired result:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import explode, col

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Create the first dataframe
data = [
    (""Campaign 1"", [1.0, 5.0], [""L2"", ""L3""]),
    (""Campaign 1"", [1.1], [""L1""]),
    (""Campaign 2"", [1.2], [""L2""]),
    (""Campaign 2"", [1.1], [""L4"", ""L5""])
]
df1 = spark.createDataFrame(data, [""name"", ""segment_list"", ""rung_list""])

# Create the second dataframe
data = [
    (124001823, 1.0, ""L2""),
    (166001989, 5.0, ""L2""),
    (768002266, 1.1, ""L1"")
]
df2 = spark.createDataFrame(data, [""customer_id"", ""segment"", ""rung""])

# Explode the segment_list and rung_list columns in df1
df1_exploded = df1.select(""name"", explode(""segment_list"").alias(""segment""), explode(""rung_list"").alias(""rung""))

# Perform inner join between df1_exploded and df2 based on segment and rung columns
final_df = df1_exploded.join(df2, (df1_exploded.segment == df2.segment) & (df1_exploded.rung == df2.rung))

# Select the desired columns and show the result
final_df.select(""name"", ""customer_id"").show()
```

The `explode` function is used to transform the arrays in `segment_list` and `rung_list` columns into individual rows. Then, an inner join is performed between the exploded dataframe (`df1_exploded`) and `df2` based on the matching `segment` and `rung` values. Finally, the desired columns (`name` and `customer_id`) are selected and displayed.

This approach avoids using a for loop or going row by row, and leverages the power of Spark SQL's join operation for efficient processing.",0.6633753776550293,"apache-spark, pyspark, apache-spark-sql",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74350679,"Python mixins : how to deal with *args, **kwargs when calling super()?","In the following example I show some mixins that may or may not use *args or **kwargs:

Here I encounter an issue because the last mixin is calling its parent which doesn't exist:
Cell In [4], line 9, in BMixin.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
      8 def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
----&gt; 9     super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

     11     self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))

TypeError: object.__init__() takes exactly one argument 
           (the instance to initialize)

How should I modify this example to allow any combination of mixins, and inherit mixins in any order?
One possible UGLY solution is to add a dummy end mixin:
class EndMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        ...
        
class AMixin(EndMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;AMixin&quot;)
        self.a = 'a' + str(kwargs.get('a', ''))
        
class BMixin(EndMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;BMixin&quot;)        
        self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))
               

","You can make your mixins inherit from a base-class that stops the super call to object.
class BaseMixin:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass


class AMixin(BaseMixin):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)


obj = AB(a='a', b='b')
print(obj.b)
print(obj.a)

","To fix the issue with calling `super()` in mixins with `*args` and `**kwargs`, you can modify the mixin classes to handle the case when the parent class does not have an `__init__` method that accepts `*args` and `**kwargs`. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
class AMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(""AMixin"")
        self.a = 'a' + str(kwargs.get('a', ''))
        super().__init__(**kwargs) if hasattr(super(), '__init__') else None

class BMixin:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(""BMixin"")
        self.b = 'b' + str(kwargs.get('b', ''))
        super().__init__(**kwargs) if hasattr(super(), '__init__') else None

class ABMixin(AMixin, BMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(""ABMixin"")
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

class A(AMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

class B(BMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

class AB(ABMixin):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(""AB"")
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

AB(a='a', b='b')
```

In this updated code, I added a check using `hasattr(super(), '__init__')` to see if the parent class has an `__init__` method. If it does, then `super().__init__(**kwargs)` is called. Otherwise, it skips the call to `super().__init__`. This way, it allows any combination of mixins and inherits mixins in any order without throwing the `TypeError`.

Note: The `EndMixin` approach mentioned in your question can work as well, but it adds an unnecessary dummy mixin class. The updated solution avoids the need for an extra mixin class.",0.885263204574585,"python, oop, traits, mixins",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

3. Replaced `.Characters(Start:=11, Length:=14)` with `.Characters(Start:=InStr(1, Range(""BH"" & kk).Value, var32), Length:=Len(var32))` in the second line. This new approach finds the starting position of `var32` within the cell value and sets the length to the length of `var32`.
4. Set the font color of the specified characters to red using `Font.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)`. This will make the text in `var32` red.

And as you update the input, the variable name will be updated. If you dont want it updated just use [ngModel] instead of [(ngModel)]
","To fix the issue of the input value not being displayed when using ngModel, you need to make a small adjustment to your code. 

Instead of using the `value` attribute, you can use the `ngModel` directive to bind the input value to a variable in your component. Here's how you can modify your code:

First, in your component.ts file, declare a variable to hold the initial value of the input:

```
export class YourComponent {
  name = 'John';
}
```

Then, in your component.html file, use the `ngModel` directive to bind the input value to the `name` variable:

```
<input type=""text"" [(ngModel)]=""name"" name=""name"">
```

By using `[(ngModel)]`, you are creating a two-way data binding between the input field and the `name` variable. This means that any changes made to the input value will update the `name` variable, and vice versa.

With this modification, the initial value 'John' will be displayed in the input field when the page loads, and any changes made to the input will be reflected in the `name` variable.",0.8197073936462402,angular,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73690166,Can you generate a scene graph after a plant has been finalized?,"I'm working on a project that requires me to add a model through Parser (which requires the plant to be of the same type as the array used) before Setting the position of the model in said plant and taking distance queries. These queries only work when the query object generated from the scene graph is of type float.
I've run into a problem where setting the position doesn't work due to the array being used being of type AutoDiff. A possible solution would then be converting the plant of type float to Autodiff with plant.ToAutoDiff(), but this only creates a copy of the plant without coupling it to the scene graph (and in turn the query object) from which the queries are derived. Taking queries with a query object generated from the original plant would then fail to reflect the new position passed to the AutoDiff copy.
Is there a way to create a new scene graph from the already finalized symbolic copy of the original plant, so that I can perform the queries with it?
","A couple of thoughts:

Don't just convert the plant to autodiff. Convert the whole diagram. That will give you a converted, connected network.
You're stuck with the current workflow. Presumably, your proximity geometries are specified in your parsed file (as &lt;collision&gt; tags). The parsing process is ephemeral. The declaration is consumed, passed through MultibodyPlant into SceneGraph. If there is no SceneGraph at parse time, all knowledge of the declared collision geometry is forgotten.

So, the typical workflow is:

Create a float-valued diagram.
Scalar convert it to an AutoDiff-valued diagram.
Keep both around to serve the different roles.

We don't have a tutorial that directly shows scalar converting an entire diagram, but it's akin to what is shown in this MultibodyPlant-specific tutorial. Just call ToScalarType() on the Diagram root.
","To fix the problem you're facing, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new scene graph: After finalizing the plant and obtaining the symbolic copy, you can create a new scene graph using the `SceneGraph` class provided by drake. The scene graph represents the geometry and structure of the objects in your simulation.

2. Add the model to the scene graph: Once you have the new scene graph, you can add your model to it using the appropriate methods provided by the `SceneGraph` class. This will ensure that the model is now part of the scene graph and can be used for distance queries.

3. Generate a query object: With the model added to the scene graph, you can now generate a query object using the `QueryObject` class provided by drake. This object allows you to perform distance queries and other operations on the scene graph.

4. Convert the query object to float type: By default, the query object generated from the scene graph is of type `AutoDiff`. However, you mentioned that you need it to be of type float. To achieve this, you can use the `ToAutoDiff` method on the query object to convert it to float type.

Once you have followed these steps, you should have a new scene graph that includes your model, and a query object of type float that reflects the new position you have set. You can now use this query object to perform distance queries and other operations as required by your project.",0.5177192091941833,drake,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Can someone help to understand the issue
","Adding 'search' before the source should resolve it.
either 'search' or '|' should be the first command while creating search query via rest api.
","The issue you are facing is due to the usage of an unknown search command 'source' in your Splunk search query. The 'source' command is not a valid Splunk command, which is why you are getting the 'Unknown search command' error.

To fix this issue, you need to modify your search query. Instead of using the 'source' command, you should use the 'index' command to specify the index from which you want to retrieve the data. 

Here's an example of how you can modify your search query:

String mySearch = ""index=your_index_here sourcetype=your_sourcetype_here country=\""XX\"" serviceName=\""/services/*\"" | chart count by serviceName"";
Job job = service.getJobs().create(mySearch);

Replace 'your_index_here' with the appropriate index name and 'your_sourcetype_here' with the relevant sourcetype for your data. This modified search query should work without any 'Unknown search command' errors.

Make sure to replace 'your_index_here' and 'your_sourcetype_here' with the actual values specific to your Splunk environment.

By making this change, you will be able to execute the search query successfully using the Splunk Enterprise SDK for Java.",0.5433088541030884,"splunk, splunk-query, splunk-sdk",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    val it: (('_a -&gt; '_b) -&gt; '_a -&gt; '_b)    
Either make the arguments to 'it' explicit or, if you do not intend for it to be generic, add a type annotation.

Can someone explain what's going on with this error in the F# type system?
To me,
val it: (('_a -&gt; '_b) -&gt; '_a -&gt; '_b) should be actually the expected result, and how can I sort this out? Thanks.
","My previous answer explains what Value Restriction is and why it happens. But now your next question is: ok, so what do I do about it?
As the error message itself suggests, there are two possible ways: (1) give it explicit arguments or (2) if you don't want it to be generic, add a type annotation.
1. Explicit arguments
let flippedPipe x = flip (|&gt;) x

Even though logically this is the same as let flippedPipe = flip (|&gt;), syntactically this is now a function, not a value. And syntax is what matters for the Value Restriction.
2. A type annotation
let flippedPipe : (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int -&gt; int = flip (|&gt;)

This works because the function is no longer generic, so the Value Restriction does not apply. This is a desirable option in many circumstances, but judging by the kinds of functions you're working with here, I would assume this is not what you wanted in this case.
3. Explicit type parameters
The error message doesn't mention this, and in fairness, it can be considered a variation of option (2). The idea is that you can give your function explicit type parameters like this:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; = flip (|&gt;)

This makes the Value Restriction go away, because, even though it still technically applies, the fact that you added the type parameters presumably shows that you know what you're doing, so the compiler shuts up.
However, though this appears to work at first glance, it does so in the wrong way. If you look at the inferred type of this function, you'll see:
val flippedPipe : (obj -&gt; obj) -&gt; obj  -&gt; obj

This happens because, even though you added type parameters, you didn't specify exactly where they go. They may not be used at all (aka &quot;phantom types&quot;) for all the compiler knows.
So to make it work properly, this should be the definition:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = flip (|&gt;)

","The error you are encountering is related to a concept called ""value restriction"" in F#. The value restriction is a restriction imposed by the F# type system that prevents certain types of values from being inferred as generic. This is done to ensure type safety.

In your case, the error is occurring because the `flip` function is being applied to the `(|>)` operator without any explicit type annotations. The F# compiler is unable to infer the type of `(|>)` and therefore infers it as a generic function. However, the value restriction prevents the inference of generic values in certain situations, and this is one of them.

To fix this issue, you can either make the arguments to `(|>)` explicit or add a type annotation to the `flip` function. Here are two possible solutions:

1. Making the arguments explicit:
```
flip (|>) (fun x -> x + 1) 3
```

2. Adding a type annotation to the `flip` function:
```
let flip<'a, 'b, 'c> = fun (f : 'a -> 'b -> 'c) (a : 'b) (b : 'a) -> f b a
```

Either of these approaches will help resolve the value restriction error and allow your code to compile successfully.",0.7427571415901184,"haskell, functional-programming, f#, type-systems",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I don't know where to start!
Any ideas?
","For your question, reason your app lost all photos everytime you refresh because it was temporary store but not save somewhere else ( internet or on local).
If you want to save it on you own server, create server side and do with api.
Come to local here, you have come to the right path finding a local which is Core Data to store. But the key point to need to know here is:

Saving image to local should use FileManager ( which means each app have the own documentary folder in your phone so save the not only image but document, files, everything else to here - It will lost only when your app is uninstalled) You just need to keep the name of the image ( you can create your own name to save image)

Code will be like this
func saveImage(imageName: String, image: UIImage) {
    // get documentary path to save image to
    guard let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first else { return }

    let fileName = imageName
    let fileURL = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent(fileName)
    guard let data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1) else { return }

    //Checks if file exists, removes it if so.
    if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: fileURL.path) {
        do {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(atPath: fileURL.path)
            print(&quot;Removed old image&quot;)
        } catch let removeError {
            print(&quot;couldn't remove file at path&quot;, removeError)
        }

    }
    
    do {
        try data.write(to: fileURL)
    } catch let error {
        print(&quot;error saving file with error&quot;, error)
    }
}

func loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String) -&gt; UIImage? {
  let documentDirectory = FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.documentDirectory

    let userDomainMask = FileManager.SearchPathDomainMask.userDomainMask
    let paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(documentDirectory, userDomainMask, true)

    if let dirPath = paths.first {
        let imageUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: dirPath).appendingPathComponent(fileName)
        let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: imageUrl.path)
        return image

    }

    return nil
}

Next is the Core Data or UserDefaults is where you save the key connect to the list of name images you save before. So everytime you come into app, just take the list image name out from the key and appear it again
I will do with UserDefaults you can try to implement the same with CoreData. I save image as name is number so I save to UserDefault only the number of images. You can change to something like you want
Code will be like this
var imageArray = [UIImage]()
var countImage = 0

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // get number of image have been saved
    let countImage = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: &quot;test&quot;)

    if countImage &lt; 1 {
        return
    }
    
    for i in 1...countImage {
        // get image from disk
        imageArray.append(self.loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String(i))!)
    }
    
    print(imageArray)
    self.collectionView.reloadData() // reload collection view
}

func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    let group = DispatchGroup()
    
    results.forEach { result in
        group.enter()
        result.itemProvider.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self) { reading, error in
            defer {
                group.leave()
            }
            guard let image = reading as? UIImage, error == nil else {
                return
            }
            // add to user's photo array
            print(image)
            self.imageArray.append(image)
            // append self.countImage to 1 and save number to  UserDefault and image to FileManager
            self.countImage += 1
            UserDefaults.standard.set(self.countImage, forKey: &quot;test&quot;)
            self.saveImage(imageName: String(self.countImage), image: image)
        }
    }
    
    group.notify(queue: .main) {
        self.collectionView.reloadData()
    }
}

","To permanently save the photos in your Xcode app, you can use Core Data to store the image data. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

1. Create a Core Data model with an entity called ""Photo"" that has an attribute of type ""Binary Data"" to store the image data.

2. In your `ViewController`, import the Core Data framework and add a property for the managed object context (MOC). This is the interface to your app's managed objects.

```swift
import CoreData

class ViewController: UIViewController, PHPickerViewControllerDelegate {

    // ...
    var managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext?
    // ...
}
```

3. In your `viewDidLoad` method, initialize the managed object context.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // ...
    guard let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate else {
        return
    }
    managedObjectContext = appDelegate.persistentContainer.viewContext
    // ...
}
```

4. Modify the `picker(_:didFinishPicking:)` method to save the selected images to Core Data.

```swift
func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    let group = DispatchGroup()
    
    results.forEach { result in
        group.enter()
        result.itemProvider.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self) { reading, error in
            defer {
                group.leave()
            }
            guard let image = reading as? UIImage, error == nil else {
                return
            }
            // add to user's photo array
            imageArray.append(image)
            
            // Save the image to Core Data
            if let context = self.managedObjectContext {
                let photo = Photo(context: context)
                photo.imageData = image.pngData()
                
                do {
                    try context.save()
                } catch {
                    print(""Failed to save image to Core Data: \(error)"")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    group.notify(queue: .main) {
        self.collectionView.reloadData()
    }
}
```

5. Update the `collectionView(_:cellForItemAt:)` method to load the images from Core Data.

```swift
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    // ...
    if let context = self.managedObjectContext {
        let request: NSFetchRequest<Photo> = Photo.fetchRequest()
        
        do {
            let photos = try context.fetch(request)
            if let imageData = photos[indexPath.row].imageData {
                cell.imageView.image = UIImage(data: imageData)
            }
        } catch {
            print(""Failed to fetch photos from Core Data: \(error)"")
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

By following these steps, you can save the images to Core Data and retrieve them when the app is refreshed.",0.6993552446365356,"swift, xcode, swiftui, core-data, uiimage",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

   &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;

So, when the user enters the email or number of Tickets, the submit button will direct the result to /bookings/search javascript that goes through the database (Mongo DB). The email supports partial matching.
I want to do is: say, the user enters 'atom' in email and 2 in number of Tickets, then the action query should look like /bookings/search?email=atom&amp;numTickets=2.
I believe it is related to javascript, but I am not sure how to do it.
My bookings/search looks like this:
bookings/search
","Just changed the method to &quot;get&quot; instead of &quot;post&quot; and it works.
","To generate the action link dynamically based on the user's search criteria, you can use JavaScript to capture the form inputs and construct the action URL.

First, add an id attribute to your form element like this:

```html
<form id=""searchForm"" action=""/bookings/search"" method=""POST"">
```

Then, add an id attribute to your submit button:

```html
<button id=""searchButton"" type=""submit"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Search</button>
```

Next, you can add a JavaScript function to handle the form submission and construct the action URL. You can place this script either in a separate JavaScript file or directly in your HTML file using the `<script>` tag.

```javascript
<script>
  document.getElementById('searchForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from submitting normally
    
    var email = document.getElementById('inputEmail3').value;
    var numTickets = document.getElementById('inputPassword3').value;
    
    var actionUrl = ""/bookings/search?"";
    
    if (email) {
      actionUrl += ""email="" + encodeURIComponent(email) + ""&"";
    }
    
    if (numTickets) {
      actionUrl += ""numTickets="" + encodeURIComponent(numTickets);
    }
    
    // Redirect to the constructed action URL
    window.location.href = actionUrl;
  });
</script>
```

In this script, we listen for the form's submit event and prevent it from submitting normally using `e.preventDefault()`. Then, we retrieve the values of the email and numTickets inputs. We construct the action URL by appending the query parameters using the appropriate format. Finally, we redirect the user to the constructed action URL using `window.location.href`.

With this code, when the user clicks the search button, the form will be submitted to the JavaScript code instead of the server. The JavaScript code will capture the form inputs, construct the action URL with the appropriate query parameters, and redirect the user to the search URL with the selected criteria.",0.2062646746635437,"javascript, html, node.js, express",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

aws assume-impersonation-role --organization-id … --impersonation-role-id …

rather than the intended
aws workmail assume-impersonation-role --organization-id … --impersonation-role-id …

?
","To fix the issue of missing commands in AWS CLI, you need to ensure that you have installed the necessary AWS CLI plugins or extensions required for the specific command you are trying to run.

In this case, you are trying to run the ""aws assume-impersonation-role"" command, which is not a built-in command in AWS CLI. It seems like you are referring to the documentation for the AWS CLI plugin for WorkMail.

To use the ""aws assume-impersonation-role"" command, you need to install the AWS CLI plugin for WorkMail. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the AWS CLI plugin for WorkMail:
   ```
   aws configure add-model --service-model https://email.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awscli-WorkMail-2019-07-01.normal.json
   ```

   This command downloads and installs the necessary plugin model for WorkMail.

3. After installing the plugin, you should be able to run the ""aws assume-impersonation-role"" command without the ""invalid choice"" error.

Note: Make sure you have an active internet connection while installing the plugin, as it needs to download the necessary files.

Once the plugin is installed, you can refer to the official AWS CLI documentation for WorkMail for further details on how to use the ""aws assume-impersonation-role"" command and its options.

Remember, AWS CLI is a versatile tool with various plugins and extensions available for different AWS services. You need to install the relevant plugins to access the commands specific to those services.",0.7622411251068115,"amazon-web-services, aws-cli",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73270959,React Semantic UI Search component only accepts one character at a time (which also eliminates the previous input),"I am using search component from Semantic UI. When I console.log what I typed in the search field, only a single character is printed ('abcd' will be printed as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd') and the search field doesn't show any character as if it doesn't take any input. But If I used &lt;Input&gt; &lt;/Input&gt; instead, these problems are gone.
code sample is here
","This works as intended. Did you forget to actually set state?
const handleSearchChange = useCallback((e, data) =&gt; {
    setValue(data.value);
    setLoading(!loading);
  }, []);

","The issue you are facing is related to the behavior of the Semantic UI Search component. By default, the Search component is designed to handle search queries one character at a time, and it updates the search results accordingly. This behavior is useful for live search functionality where the search results need to be updated in real-time as the user types.

To fix this issue and allow the Search component to accept multiple characters at once, you can make use of the `onSearchChange` event handler provided by Semantic UI. This event is triggered whenever the user types or changes the search input.

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Search } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const MySearchComponent = () => {
  const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useState('');

  const handleSearchChange = (e, { value }) => {
    setSearchValue(value);
  };

  return (
    <Search
      value={searchValue}
      onSearchChange={handleSearchChange}
      showNoResults={false}
    />
  );
};

export default MySearchComponent;
```

In the code above, we are using the `useState` hook to manage the search value state. The `handleSearchChange` function is responsible for updating the search value whenever the user types or changes the input. By setting the `value` prop of the Search component to `searchValue` and providing the `onSearchChange` event handler, we ensure that the Search component reflects the user's input correctly.

Additionally, I've added the `showNoResults` prop to hide the ""No Results"" message when there are no search results.

By making these changes, the Search component should now accept multiple characters at once and display the input correctly.",0.5146301984786987,"javascript, reactjs, semantic-ui",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73442986,How to concatenate millions array records to a single string faster?,"I am trying to concatenate all values of a 2D array to a single String.
But performance is really impacted by size of the array (2800 X 1700).
I there a better way to do it ?
Thank you !
float[][] datas = obj.getMatrix();
String result = &quot;&quot;;
int[] shape = {2800,1700};
for(k=0; k&lt;shape[0]; k++){
   for(j=0; j&lt;shape[1]; j++){
      result += (datas[k][j] + &quot;&quot;).getBytes();
   }
}

UPDATE
I am using unidata netCDF java API to convert my data for ncML response.
My float[][] gives me some values that i want to add to a list.
Instead of doing a String result = &quot;10.0,15.1,45.6,25.4.....&quot; I want to convert each value to byte[]. My string will look like result = &quot;[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx....&quot;
Then,  I can convert my result into Base64 using Base64.getEncoder().encode(result.getBytes())
It will look like :
float[][] datas = obj.getMatrix();
    StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
    int[] shape = {2800,1700};
    for(k=0; k&lt;shape[0]; k++){
       for(j=0; j&lt;shape[1]; j++){
          result.append((datas[k][j] + &quot;&quot;).getBytes());
       }
    }
byte[] encodedByte = Base64.getEcnoder().encode(result);
String encodedStr = new String(result);

Then, when user get the response, he will decode the result, obtain the &quot;[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx[B@xxxxxxxx....&quot; responseand can identify values
UPDATE 2
Thanks to all the comments, I understand what it cannot works.
Finally, I decided to just do : result.append(datas[k][j] + &quot;,&quot;);
","Use StringBuilder instead of string for result. This will reduce time to few secs.
as given below
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int[] shape = {2800,1700};
        for(int k=0; k&lt;shape[0]; k++){
            for(int j=0; j&lt;shape[1]; j++){
                result.append ((datas[k][j] + &quot;&quot;).getBytes() );
            }
        }

","To concatenate millions of array records to a single string faster, you can use the StringBuilder class instead of concatenating strings directly. The StringBuilder class provides better performance for string concatenation operations. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```java
float[][] datas = obj.getMatrix();
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
int[] shape = {2800, 1700};
for (int k = 0; k < shape[0]; k++) {
   for (int j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++) {
      result.append(datas[k][j]).append("","");
   }
}
String finalResult = result.toString();
```

By using the StringBuilder class, you can avoid the performance impact caused by repeated string concatenation. The append() method efficiently appends values to the StringBuilder object without creating unnecessary string objects.

Note that in your updated code, you are trying to append the byte array representation of the float values, which is not what you actually want. If you want to convert the float values to byte arrays, you can use the ByteBuffer class. Here's an updated version of your code:

```java
float[][] datas = obj.getMatrix();
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
int[] shape = {2800, 1700};
for (int k = 0; k < shape[0]; k++) {
   for (int j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++) {
      byte[] bytes = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putFloat(datas[k][j]).array();
      result.append(Arrays.toString(bytes)).append("","");
   }
}
String finalResult = result.toString();
```

This code uses the ByteBuffer class to convert each float value to a byte array representation and then appends it to the StringBuilder object. The Arrays.toString() method is used to convert the byte array to a string representation.

Remember to import the necessary classes at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.util.Arrays;
```

I hope this helps in improving the performance of concatenating the array records to a single string.",0.7696813344955444,"java, arrays, for-loop",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73398477,How to use the next_rails gem for dual booting on heroku,"I am using the next_rails gem for dual booting and am ready to test on heroku, which I normally do by git push staging master. How do I test the next rails version on heroku?
","In theory you should be able to set the BUNDLE_GEMFILE Heroku environment variable to Gemfile.next, and then just push it to staging e.g.
heroku config:set  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.next -r staging

git push staging master

Unfortunately there appears to be an issue with the Heroku ruby buildpack. My work around is as follows
a) use the next_rails gem as documented for development server and development tests
b) Once ready for testing deployment, create a new branch, with the only change is for the Gemfile to go from:
...
if next?
  gem 'rails', '~&gt; 7.0.3.1'
  gem &quot;sprockets-rails&quot;
else
  gem 'rails', '~&gt; 6.1.6.1'
end

to:
...
 gem 'rails', '~&gt; 7.0.3.1'

And deploy that branch to staging. This branch only needs to be merged with master when you want to test out staging.
If the issue is resolved, I will update this answer.
","To test the next rails version on Heroku using the next_rails gem for dual booting, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the next_rails gem installed in your Rails application. You can add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'next_rails'
```

2. After adding the gem, run `bundle install` to install the gem and update your Gemfile.lock.

3. Next, you need to configure your application to use the next_rails gem for dual booting. In your `config/application.rb` file, add the following line:

```ruby
require 'next_rails'
```

4. Now, you can create a new branch for your next rails version. For example, you can create a branch called `next-rails`:

```shell
git checkout -b next-rails
```

5. Make the necessary changes and updates to your application for the next rails version on this branch.

6. Once you are ready to test on Heroku, commit your changes and push the `next-rails` branch to your staging remote repository:

```shell
git push staging next-rails
```

7. Heroku will automatically detect the new branch and deploy it to your staging environment.

8. You can then access your application on Heroku using the staging URL to test the next rails version.

Note: Make sure you have set up a staging environment on Heroku and have the necessary configurations in place for your staging remote repository.

By following these steps, you should be able to test the next rails version on Heroku using the next_rails gem for dual booting.",0.7936216592788696,"ruby-on-rails, heroku, next-rails",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

lng,lat=8.89458178871303, 41.657804855447374

","G=ox.graph_from_point((lat, lng),custom_filter=road_filter,dist=100,simplify=False,retain_all=True,truncate_by_edge=True)

simplify=False and truncate_by_edge=True did the trick.

","In OSMNx, the `graph_from_point` function fetches the road network within a specified distance from the given point. By default, it only includes the nodes that fall within the distance threshold.

In your case, if you want to include roads that extend beyond the specified distance, you can modify the `graph_from_point` function to use the `distance_type` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify the type of distance calculation to use.

To include roads that extend beyond the distance, you can set the `distance_type` parameter to `'network'`. This will calculate the distance based on the actual road network rather than a straight-line distance.

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```python
import osmnx as ox

lng, lat = 8.89458178871303, 41.657804855447374
road_filter = '[&quot;highway&quot;~&quot;secondary&quot;]'

# Set distance_type to 'network' to include roads beyond the specified distance
G = ox.graph_from_point((lat, lng), custom_filter=road_filter, dist=100, distance_type='network')
```

By specifying `distance_type='network'`, the `graph_from_point` function will consider the road network connectivity and include roads that are reachable from the given point, even if their extreme end nodes are beyond the specified distance.

With this modification, you should be able to fetch the road network inside the blue circle, including roads that extend beyond the 100-meter distance threshold.",0.5317084789276123,"networkx, openstreetmap, osmnx",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To convert a string ArrayList to a model ArrayList in Flutter, you can use the `map` function to iterate over the string list and convert each element into a model object. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```dart
List<String> langList = ['English', 'Gujarati', 'Hindi', 'Marathi', 'Punjabi', 'Urdu', 'Spanish'];

var selectedLanguagesList = <LanguageDatum>[].obs;

// Iterate over the string list and convert each element to a model object
selectedLanguagesList.value = langList.map((lang) => LanguageDatum(name: lang)).toList();
```

In the above example, we are using the `map` function to iterate over each element of `langList` and create a new `LanguageDatum` object using the `name` parameter. Finally, we convert the mapped result to a list using the `toList()` function and assign it to `selectedLanguagesList.value`.

Make sure to import the `LanguageDatum` class in the file where you are performing this conversion.

Note: The above example assumes that you only want to set the `name` property of the `LanguageDatum` model. If you want to set other properties as well, you can modify the mapping logic accordingly.",0.6291014552116394,"flutter, dart, arraylist",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","You can use groupby with something like:

","The code you provided seems to be a reasonable approach for extracting quarterly data and exporting it to quarterly folders. However, there are a few areas where you can improve the code:

1. Instead of using string formatting to create the save location, you can use the `os.path.join()` function to handle path concatenation in a platform-independent way.

```python
import os

# Group the data by quarter
grouped = ad.groupby('quarter')

# Iterate over the groups

    # Export the data to CSV

","Based on the provided code snippet and the behavior you described, it seems that the snowflake-connector is producing debug information during the parsing process. This debug information is not related to the simple-ddl-parser library but rather specific to the snowflake-connector itself.

To resolve this issue, you can try disabling the debug output from the snowflake-connector. You can achieve this by setting the logging level to a higher level, such as WARNING or ERROR. Here's how you can modify your code to disable the debug output:

```python
import logging
import snowflake.connector
from simple_ddl_parser import DDLParser

# Disable snowflake-connector debug output
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)

ctx = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='xxx',
    account='xxx', 
    warehouse='xxx', 
    database='xxx',       
    schema ='xxx',
    role = 'xxx',
    authenticator=""externalbrowser"")        

cs = ctx.cursor()

try:
    cs.execute(""select get_ddl('table', 'xxx');"")
    ddl = cs.fetchone()
    result = DDLParser(ddl[0]).run()
finally:
    cs.close()

ctx.close()
```

By setting the logging level to WARNING, you will only see log messages with a level of WARNING and above, effectively suppressing the debug information from snowflake-connector. This should help you to focus on the output of the simple-ddl-parser library without being distracted by the additional debug information.

Give this modification a try and see if it resolves the issue and provides you with the desired output.",0.5814877152442932,"python, snowflake-cloud-data-platform, ddl",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Using online calculator https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573218 I get 11.37 for the mean. (CD 0.5, shape 0.5 scale 50)
","There are two things to keep in mind:

Math.Net is using shape and rate (or inverse scale) definition of gamma distribution, while most online calculators are using shape and scale.
The lower (or upper) CDF is not equal the expectation value of the distribution: if you do the integral to calculate the expected value, you get E[X] = shape/rate, that is quite close to the result you get from your code

","The issue with your code lies in the parameters you are passing to the `Gamma` distribution constructor. In your code, you are using a shape parameter of 0.5 and a scale parameter of 50. However, according to the online calculator you mentioned, the correct parameters for a mean of 11.37 are shape = 0.5 and scale = 22.74.

To fix the problem, you need to update the parameters in the `Gamma` distribution constructor to match the values you obtained from the online calculator. Here's the updated code:

```csharp
using System;
using MathNet.Numerics.Distributions;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        double sum = 0.0;
        var dist = new Gamma(0.5, 22.74);

            sum += dist.Sample();
        }
        Console.WriteLine((sum / runs).ToString());
    }
}
```

By making this change, you should now get a mean value close to 11.37, which matches the result from the online calculator.",0.6423686742782593,"c#, mathnet-numerics",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Fails to compile with the following error message:
error[E0658]: cannot borrow here, since the borrowed element may contain interior mutability

    |        ^

If I replace the arguments n and k with references, it compiles. Turns out, the functions in the PartialOrd are also implemented using references. So from my understanding, the expression 2 &lt; 4 will call the le function with references. For performance reasons, I doubt that's what's happening, though.
It's actually two questions that I'm asking:

Can I solve the error without using references?
Why is PartialOrd using references while Ord uses values (at least for min and max, but not for cmp)?

","
Adding #![feature(const_refs_to_cell)] makes it compile.
min and max take Self because they return one of the two arguments as Self. Other methods in Ord and PartialOrd else returns a bool or an Ordering so they can take by reference. if min and max they took by reference the signature would be fn max&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self, other: &amp;'a Self) -&gt; &amp;'a Self which you &quot;get for free&quot; because there is a impl&lt;A&gt; Ord for &amp;A where A: Ord.

","The error you are encountering is related to the borrow checker in Rust. The borrow checker ensures that the code is safe and prevents certain types of bugs, such as use-after-free or data races.

In your `foo` function, you are comparing the values `n` and `k` using the `<` operator. However, since these values are generic, the borrow checker cannot guarantee that they are not borrowed from somewhere else and may contain interior mutability. This is why you are seeing the error message.

To solve this error without using references, you can change the constraint `T: Copy` to `T: Ord`. The `Ord` trait is a stronger constraint than `PartialOrd` and requires values to be fully copyable. By using `Ord`, you ensure that the values `n` and `k` are not borrowed and can be safely compared.

Regarding your second question, the `PartialOrd` trait uses references for comparisons for performance reasons. Comparing values using references avoids copying the values unnecessarily. On the other hand, the `Ord` trait uses values for `min` and `max` methods because these methods take ownership of the values and need to return the minimum or maximum value itself.

In summary, to fix the error, change `T: Copy` to `T: Ord` in the constraints of your `foo` function. This will ensure that the values `n` and `k` can be safely compared without borrowing issues.",0.5631979703903198,rust,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

This functionality is provided in Javascript when creating mongo schema using
var yourSchema = new Schema({..}, { timestamps: { createdAt: 'created_at', updatedAt: 'updated_at'} });

How exactly can this be done in pymongo?
","This is a mongoose feature, not to be confused with javascript or MongoDB.
pymongo does not offer such capabilities.
You will just have to manually specify them in your operations, for example:
from datetime import datetime

db.collection.updateOne({
   &quot;key&quot;: 5
},
{
  &quot;$set&quot;: { &quot;updated_at&quot;: datetime.now() },
  &quot;$setOnInsert&quot;: { &quot;created_at&quot;: datetime.now() }
}, upsert=True)

","To add auto-generated fields `created_at` and `updated_at` in MongoDB using pymongo, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the required modules:
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime
```

2. Connect to your MongoDB database:
```python
client = MongoClient(""mongodb://localhost:27017/"")
database = client[""your_database_name""]
collection = database[""your_collection_name""]
```

3. Create a function to update the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:
```python
def update_document(document):
    current_time = datetime.now()
    if ""created_at"" not in document:
        document[""created_at""] = current_time
    document[""updated_at""] = current_time
```

4. Before inserting or updating a document, call the `update_document` function:
```python
document = {
    ""field1"": ""value1"",
    ""field2"": ""value2""
}

update_document(document)

collection.insert_one(document)
```

Now, when you insert or update a document in MongoDB using pymongo, the `created_at` field will be automatically set to the current time if it doesn't exist, and the `updated_at` field will always be set to the current time.

Note: Unlike in JavaScript, where the timestamps functionality is provided by the mongoose library, in pymongo, you need to manually handle the creation and update of these fields.",0.7688270211219788,"python-3.x, mongodb, pymongo",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Demo
","To extract the start and end moments of multiple ranges from the ""StatusMotor"" column, you can use a combination of conditional statements and key-value comparisons in your SQL query.

Assuming your table name is ""TableName"", you can use the following query to extract the desired ranges:

```sql
SELECT MIN(DateTime) AS StartDateTime, MAX(DateTime) AS EndDateTime
FROM (
    SELECT DateTime, MotorStatus,
        CASE
            WHEN MotorStatus = 'Start' AND (LAG(MotorStatus) OVER (ORDER BY DateTime) = 'Stop' OR LAG(MotorStatus) OVER (ORDER BY DateTime) = 'Standby') THEN 1

            ELSE 0
        END AS RangeStart
    FROM TableName
) AS temp
WHERE RangeStart = 1
GROUP BY MotorStatus
```

Explanation:
1. The inner subquery uses the LAG function to compare the current MotorStatus with the previous row's MotorStatus. This helps identify the start of a range when it is either preceded by a 'Stop' or 'Standby' status.
2. The CASE statement assigns a value of 1 to the RangeStart column for the rows where a range should start.
3. The outer query then selects the minimum DateTime for the start of each range and the maximum DateTime for the end of each range, grouping them by MotorStatus.

This query will give you the desired result, where you can see the start and end moments for each range of motor activity.",0.6119323372840881,"mysql, conditional-statements, range, key-value, record",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74509701,How to get minimum LocalDateTime from array in Java,"I have an array:
LocalDateTime[] onTimes
I would like to find an efficient way (without iteration) of finding the minimum LocalDateTime.
Is there a quick way to do this?
","You could, conceivably, use recursion; but I would not recommend that for performance. The best way I can think of is using the streams api like
LocalDateTime min = Arrays.stream(onTimes).min(Comparator.naturalOrder())
        .orElseThrow();

Note: This still iterates all elements internally to find the minimum.
For completeness sake; to do this without iteration, as I said, might be done recursively.
public static LocalDateTime getMinimum(LocalDateTime[] onTimes) {
    return getMinimum(onTimes, 0);
}

private static LocalDateTime getMinimum(LocalDateTime[] onTimes, int i) {
    if (i + 1 &lt; onTimes.length) {
        return min(onTimes[i], getMinimum(onTimes, i + 1));
    } else {
        return onTimes[i];
    }
}

private static LocalDateTime min(LocalDateTime a, LocalDateTime b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

","To find the minimum LocalDateTime from an array in Java without iteration, you can use the Arrays class from the java.util package. The Arrays class provides a method called min() that can be used to find the minimum element in an array. However, this method only works for arrays of primitive types, and LocalDateTime is not a primitive type. 

To overcome this limitation, you can use the Stream API introduced in Java 8. Here's how you can find the minimum LocalDateTime from the given array using streams:

1. Import the required classes:
```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.Arrays;
```

2. Define the array of LocalDateTime:
```java
LocalDateTime[] onTimes = { LocalDateTime.now(), LocalDateTime.now().minusHours(2), LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(1) };
```

3. Use the Arrays.stream() method to convert the array into a stream:
```java
LocalDateTime minDateTime = Arrays.stream(onTimes)
        .min(LocalDateTime::compareTo)
        .orElse(null);
```

In the above code, we use the stream() method to convert the array into a stream of LocalDateTime objects. Then, we use the min() method and pass the LocalDateTime::compareTo method reference as the comparator. This method reference compares two LocalDateTime objects and returns the minimum of the two. Finally, we use the orElse(null) method to handle the case where the array is empty and return null in that case.

After executing the above code, the minDateTime variable will hold the minimum LocalDateTime from the onTimes array. If the array is empty, minDateTime will be null.

Note that this approach does involve iteration internally, but it hides the iteration process from you as a developer and provides a more concise and readable code.",0.7647684812545776,"java, arrays, minimum",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

const integerArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = dateArray.map((date, index) => {
  return {
    [`row${index}`]: [date, timeArray[index], integerArray[index]],
  };
});

const finalResult = Object.assign({}, ...result);

console.log(finalResult);
```

The `map` function iterates over the `dateArray` and creates an object for each iteration. The object key is dynamically created using template literals (`[`row${index}`]`) to generate the desired key format (`row0`, `row1`, etc.). The value of each object is an array containing the corresponding elements from `dateArray`, `timeArray`, and `integerArray`.

Finally, we use `Object.assign` to merge all the objects into a single object, which gives us the desired output.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",0.7875152230262756,"javascript, reactjs, arrays, object, data-manipulation",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73660116,Enabling SMTP Basic Authentication on Office365-Tenant after 1st Oct 2022,"I understand that SMTP Basic Authentication on Office365-Tenants will be automatically disabled from the 1st October 2022 on. As SMPT Oauth 2.0 Client Credential Flow has not been implement yet by Microsoft we can't move our product implementation (non-interactive) away from Basic Authentication.
We therefore need our customers to be able to keep SMTP Basic Authentication enabled after the 1st. October.
Question:

Will existing Office365-Tenants be able to keep SMTP with Basic Authentication enabled until Oauth 2.0 Client Credential Flow will be available for SMTP?
Is the same also true for new Tenants that are created in future? 

Thanks!
","SMTP basic auth is not going away yet 😉

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-and-exchange-online-september-2021-update/ba-p/2772210 (Bolded line after the first paragraph)
","To fix the problem of enabling SMTP Basic Authentication on Office365-Tenant after 1st October 2022, you can follow these steps:

1. Review the official documentation: First, review the official documentation from Microsoft regarding the changes in SMTP Basic Authentication. This will provide you with the most up-to-date information and guidance on the topic.

2. Check existing Office365-Tenants: For existing Office365-Tenants, you need to determine whether they will be able to keep SMTP with Basic Authentication enabled until OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow is available for SMTP. This information should be mentioned in the official documentation or communicated by Microsoft.

3. Consider new Tenants: If you are creating new Tenants after 1st October 2022, you should also check whether these new Tenants will have the option to enable SMTP with Basic Authentication until OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow is available.

4. Contact Microsoft Support: If the information is not readily available or if you need further clarification, it is recommended to contact Microsoft Support. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the availability of SMTP Basic Authentication for both existing and new Tenants.

5. Evaluate alternative solutions: While waiting for OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow to be available for SMTP, you should also consider alternative solutions. This could include exploring other authentication methods or using third-party services that support SMTP Basic Authentication.

Remember to stay updated with the latest information from Microsoft regarding the changes in SMTP Basic Authentication. It is also recommended to plan and implement the necessary changes well in advance to avoid any disruptions to your product implementation.",0.7110387682914734,"azure, smtp, office365",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Based on the code provided, it seems that you are trying to display the `sources` list from the `FinalApi` class. However, when you try to display it using `finalApi![widget.index].sources.toString()`, it shows `[Instance of 'Source']` instead of the actual data.

To fix this issue, you need to access the specific properties of each `Source` object within the `sources` list. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
ListView.builder(
  shrinkWrap: true,
  itemCount: finalApi![widget.index].sources.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Text(finalApi![widget.index].sources[index].text);
  },
),
```

In the `itemBuilder`, you can access the `text` property of each `Source` object by using `finalApi![widget.index].sources[index].text`. This will display the `text` property of each `Source` object in the `ListView`.

This means that you have @nestjs/common package installed in your local repository.
Ensure you have no conflicting VS Code Extensions/Snippets/Plugins installed.
","To fix the issue with the description not showing up in NestJs, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary plugins installed in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for NestJs development. Some recommended plugins are ""NestJS"", ""NestJS Snippets"", and ""NestJS Swagger"".

2. Ensure that you have properly configured your NestJs project with the required dependencies. You should have the `@nestjs/swagger` package installed, as it is responsible for generating the API documentation.

3. Check if you have properly decorated your NestJs controllers, methods, and DTOs with appropriate decorators such as `@Controller()`, `@Get()`, `@Post()`, and `@ApiTags()`.

4. To enable the description to show up when hovering over the code, you need to use JSDoc comments above your controller methods and DTO classes. For example:

```typescript
/**
 * This is a sample controller
 * @description This is the sample controller description.
 */
@Controller()
export class SampleController {
  /**
   * This is a sample GET endpoint
   * @returns Returns a sample response
   * @description This is the sample GET endpoint description.
   */
  @Get()
  getSample(): string {
    return 'Sample response';
  }
}
```

5. Ensure that the settings in your `tsconfig.json` file are correctly configured to include JSDoc annotations. Set `""compilerOptions"": { ""allowJs"": true, ""checkJs"": true }`.

6. Restart VSCode and open your NestJs project again. Hovering over the code should now display the descriptions.

Remove autoFocus and add inputRef and onFocus
","To achieve the desired behavior of focusing on the end of the text in a TextField component from Material-UI, you can use a combination of the inputRef prop and the onFocus event handler.

  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
    ""hello world. hello world. hello world""

  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {

        }}
      />
    </Box>
  );
}
```

In this updated code, we are using a useRef hook to create a reference to the TextField component's input element. We then use useEffect to set the selection range to the end of the text whenever the value state changes.

Additionally, we set the onFocus event handler to update the selection range to the end of the text whenever the input is focused.

By combining these techniques, the TextField component will now autofocus on the end of the text as desired.",0.5631155371665955,"reactjs, material-ui, autofocus",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I need to get a result without any errors, what is an RGBA png file and how can I provide?
","The A in RGBA stands for Alpha, which is simply a value for opacity. Since this is the type needed for OpenAI, you should convert the plain RGB to RGBA leveraging an existing library. In python, I used the Python Image Library (PIL) convert function to complete this task.
","The error you are encountering is because the OpenAI PHP library requires the input image to be in the RGBA format, but the images you are providing are in the RGB format.

RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha, where Alpha represents the transparency of the image. The RGBA format is commonly used for images that require transparency, such as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

To convert your RGB PNG files to RGBA, you can use an image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. Here's how you can do it in Photoshop:

1. Open the image in Photoshop.
2. Go to the ""Image"" menu and select ""Mode.""
3. In the submenu, select ""RGB Color"" if it's not already selected.
4. Then, go back to the ""Image"" menu, select ""Mode"" again, and this time select ""RGBA Color.""
5. Save the image as a new PNG file, making sure to choose the RGBA format.

Once you have your PNG files converted to RGBA, you can provide them to the OpenAI PHP library by updating your code as follows:

```php
$otter = curl_file_create(""C:\Users\dotor\OneDrive\Desktop\dalle-examples\otter.png"");
$mask = curl_file_create(""C:\Users\dotor\OneDrive\Desktop\dalle-examples\mask.png"");

// Add the 'format' parameter to specify that the image is in RGBA format
$result = $open_ai->imageEdit([

    ""n"" => 2,
    ""size"" => ""256x256"",
    ""format"" => ""RGBA"",
]);

var_dump($result);
```

By specifying the ""format"" parameter as ""RGBA"" in the `imageEdit` method, you are informing the OpenAI library that the provided images are in the RGBA format.",0.6701802015304565,"php, rgba, openai-api",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

mystr &lt;- c(&quot;./10g/13.9264.csv&quot;, &quot;./6g/62.0544.csv&quot;)

I only want the part between the two forward slashes, i.e., &quot;10g&quot; and &quot;6g&quot;.
","You could sub() here with a capture group:

sub(&quot;.*/([^/]+)/.*&quot;, &quot;\\1&quot;, mystr)

[1] &quot;10g&quot; &quot;6g&quot;

","To extract the text between two separators in R using the stringr package, you can use the `str_extract()` or `str_match()` functions. Here's how you can solve the problem:

```R
# Load the stringr package
library(stringr)

# Define the vector of strings
mystr <- c(""./10g/13.9264.csv"", ""./6g/62.0544.csv"")

# Extract the text between two forward slashes using str_extract()
result <- str_extract(mystr, ""(?<=/)[^/]+(?=/)"")

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Explanation:
- The `str_extract()` function takes two arguments: the vector of strings and the regular expression pattern.
- In the regular expression pattern `""(?<=/)[^/]+(?=/)""`, the `(?<=/)` is a positive lookbehind assertion that matches the position right after the forward slash.
- The `[^/]+` matches one or more characters that are not a forward slash.
- The `(?=/)` is a positive lookahead assertion that matches the position right before the next forward slash.
- By combining these patterns, we can extract the text between the two forward slashes.

The output of the above code will be:
```
[1] ""10g"" ""6g""
```

This means that the text ""10g"" and ""6g"" have been extracted successfully from the original strings.",0.7319608926773071,"r, stringr",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I thought looping through all the buttons in the view and checking their index could work, but it also seems a bit inefficient to do.
","Had to make some assumptions about the Question, and there are better ways one could structure this, but here's something that works.
This will mark an incorrect answer as red if selected and checked, and will mark the correct answer as green.
You would need to likely disable the buttons or progress after the check as well.

        }
    }
}


","To fix the problem, you can make use of the `@State` property wrapper to keep track of the selected button index and the correct answer index. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:

1. Add a new `@State` property called `selectedAnswerIndex` to the `ContentView` struct to keep track of the selected answer index:

```swift
@State private var selectedAnswerIndex: Int? = nil
```

2. Modify the `AnswerButton` struct to accept an additional `isSelected` parameter and update its background color conditionally:

```swift
struct AnswerButton: View {
    let text: String
    let isSelected: Bool
    let onClick: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            onClick()
        }) {
            Text(text)
                .padding()
                .background(isSelected ? Color.gray : Color.yellow)
        }
    }
}
```

3. Inside the `ContentView` struct, update the `AnswerButton` creation code to pass the `isSelected` parameter based on the selected answer index and the correct answer index:

```swift
ForEach(question.AnswerChoices.indices) { index in
    AnswerButton(
        text: question.AnswerChoices[index],
        isSelected: index == selectedAnswerIndex || index == question.correctChoiceIndex
    ) {
        selectedAnswerIndex = index
    }
    .border(selectChoice(at: index), width: 4)
}
```

4. Modify the `CHECK` button action to change the background color of the selected answer button and the correct answer button, if necessary:

```swift
Button(""CHECK"") {
    if let selectedAnswerIndex = selectedAnswerIndex {
        // Change the background color of the selected answer button
        // and the correct answer button, if necessary
        // You can use the selectedAnswerIndex and question.correctChoiceIndex here
    }
}
.padding()
```

5. Finally, you can implement the logic inside the `CHECK` button action to change the background color of the selected answer button and the correct answer button based on their indices.

With these modifications, when the ""CHECK"" button is pressed, the background color of the selected answer button and the correct answer button will be changed accordingly.",0.8112669587135315,"ios, swift, swiftui",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73750333,"How to call onchange from python xml rpc, for Odoo 15?","Hello I want to update a MO product_qty field, but keep all the related records (picking/transfers)
synched.
If I write to the record the product_qty gets updated, but not the related record. When doing this manually it works as intended.
I have tried the following, with no success.
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', 'onchange', [1223,{'product_qty': 10}])

","The best thing to do here is more to check in the code what functions are called that have an @api.onchage with at least product_qty in it.
By quick looking in the model with _name = 'mrp.production', I can see 3 of them. Perhaps some other classes that '_inherit' from it can add some, to be verified.
So try this :
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_product_qty', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_raw', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_finished', [[1223]])

There is also the possibility (a bit more rare but exists) that another model has an onchange on its production_id.product_qty e.g.
Looking at relevant models with the Regex Search @api\.onchange.*'product_qty' in both Odoo and Enterprise (if used) can be a good idea ;)
Hope it helps !
","To call the onchange method from Python XML-RPC in Odoo 15, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the necessary credentials (database name, username, and password) to connect to the Odoo server using XML-RPC.

2. Import the required modules for XML-RPC communication in Python:

```python
import xmlrpc.client
```

3. Create an XML-RPC client object by specifying the Odoo server URL and database name:

```python
url = 'http://localhost:8069'  # Replace with your Odoo server URL
db = 'your_database_name'  # Replace with your database name
common = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/2/common')
```

4. Authenticate and retrieve the user ID (uid) using the `authenticate()` method:

```python
username = 'your_username'  # Replace with your Odoo username
password = 'your_password'  # Replace with your Odoo password
uid = common.authenticate(db, username, password, {})
```

5. Create another XML-RPC client object specifically for the Odoo models:

```python
models = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/2/object')
```

6. Call the `execute_kw()` method on the `models` object to invoke the onchange method:

```python
model_name = 'mrp.production'  # Replace with the name of your model
record_id = 1223  # Replace with the ID of the record you want to update
field_values = {'product_qty': 10}  # Replace with the field values you want to update

result = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, model_name, 'onchange', [record_id, field_values])
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders (`your_database_name`, `your_username`, `your_password`, `mrp.production`, 1223, and `{'product_qty': 10}`) with the actual values relevant to your scenario.

Note that the `execute_kw()` method takes the database name, user ID, password, model name, method name ('onchange' in this case), and a list of arguments to pass to the method.

After executing the above code, the `result` variable will contain the response from the onchange method call.

Please note that the provided solution assumes you have the necessary access rights and the onchange method is correctly implemented on the `mrp.production` model in your Odoo instance.",0.34763050079345703,"python, odoo",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

There are challenges I'm facing and didn't get to solve right now:

If there is no corresponding timeframe-match it should show null in the corresponding row
It can happen both ways that there are two or more timeframes that can fall into the timeframe of the other table and vice versa.
It occurs, that different ID's appear in table two, related to one firstID

I already tried to join the two tables with some conditions but never got the result I needed.
Here's my query:
SELECT f.firstid,
       s.secondid,
       attribute,
       attribute2,
       CASE WHEN f.valid_from &gt;= s.valid_from 
            THEN cast(f.valid_from as date)
            ELSE cast(s.valid_from as date)
       END AS valid_from
FROM first f
LEFT JOIN second AS s ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID
                     AND s.valid_from &lt;= f.valid_until

Here's my current output:

Here's the DDL to generate and populate the tables:

","You should enclose both dates from the table &quot;second&quot; inside dates from the table &quot;first&quot; and you should get your output:
SELECT f.firstid,
       s.secondid,
       attribute,
       attribute2,
       CASE WHEN f.valid_from &gt;= COALESCE(s.valid_from, -1) 
            THEN CAST(f.valid_from AS DATE)
            ELSE CAST(s.valid_from AS DATE)
       END AS valid_from
FROM      first  f
LEFT JOIN second s 
       ON f.firstid = s.sk_firstID
      AND s.valid_from &gt;= f.valid_from
      AND s.valid_until &lt;= f.valid_until

Check the demo here.
Note: in case your output should get you way more rows than the ones given here, one option is to do a cartesian product and filter out the rows you don't need.
","To fix the problem and achieve the desired output, you need to modify your SQL query to include the conditions for handling the challenges you mentioned. Here's an updated version of the query:

```sql
SELECT f.firstID, s.secondID, 
    CASE 
        WHEN f.valid_from >= s.valid_from THEN CAST(f.valid_from AS DATE)
        ELSE CAST(s.valid_from AS DATE)
    END AS valid_from,
    f.attribute AS attribute1,
    s.attribute2
FROM first f
LEFT JOIN second s ON f.firstID = s.sk_firstID
    AND (s.valid_from <= f.valid_until AND s.valid_until >= f.valid_from)
```

Explanation:
1. The query performs a left join between the ""first"" and ""second"" tables based on the ""firstID"" and ""sk_firstID"" columns.
2. The condition `(s.valid_from <= f.valid_until AND s.valid_until >= f.valid_from)` checks if the timeframes in both tables overlap or have a valid intersection.
3. The `CASE` statement ensures that the valid_from value selected is the maximum of the two valid_from values from the two tables.
4. The result includes the firstID, secondID, valid_from, attribute from the ""first"" table, and attribute2 from the ""second"" table.

This updated query should provide the expected output with null values when there is no corresponding timeframe-match. It handles the cases where multiple timeframes can fall into the timeframe of the other table and vice versa. Additionally, it considers different ID's appearing in table two related to one firstID.

Please note that the query assumes that the valid_from and valid_until columns are of type datetime or date. Adjust the casting accordingly if they are of a different data type.",0.8148115277290344,"sql, sql-server",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Note that the url in the variable u is my avatar image, a binary image. However when looking at the page_source we see HTML created by firefox (not stackoverflow) used to display the image in the browser.
Questions:
How can I get the raw image content and how can I know if I should retrieve page_source or the raw image content?
Note: The Chrome driver has similar results.
","Selenium is not built for such tasks and does not have native support for extraction of details about raw content or communication such as HTTP headers. Selenium is a method to automate browser tasks that humans would do, and humans seldom look at such details.
There are however two main ways to try to solve this issue.

By forcing the browser used in selenium to go through a HTTP proxy, allowing the proxy to capture details about the protocol &amp; raw content, while still giving access to the browser handling of dynamic content. The most prominent seems to be selenium-wire: https://pypi.org/project/selenium-wire/
By using javascript execution feature in selenium, this way we can get much more details - but are limited to what the javascript engine has access to.

","In order to fix the problem and retrieve the raw image content using Selenium in Python, you can use the `get_attribute()` method to extract the `src` attribute of the image element. Here's an updated code snippet to achieve that:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
import requests

u = 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG&amp;f=1'

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get(u)

# Find the image element
img_element = driver.find_element_by_tag_name('img')

# Get the src attribute of the image element
img_url = img_element.get_attribute('src')

# Download the image using requests library
response = requests.get(img_url)

# Save the image content to a file
with open('avatar_image.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

In this code, we first find the image element using `find_element_by_tag_name()` method and then extract the `src` attribute using `get_attribute()`. We then use the `requests` library to download the image content from the extracted URL. Finally, we save the image content to a file named 'avatar_image.png'.

Regarding your second question on how to know if you should retrieve `page_source` or the raw image content, it depends on your specific use case. If you want to extract information from the HTML of the page, then you should use `page_source`. However, if you specifically want to download and save the image file, then you should retrieve the raw image content as shown in the code above.",0.43424680829048157,"python, selenium",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Formatting your code will help immensely to start debugging this. I've reformatted your current HTML with some indenting and line breaks to help make it clear:

            &lt;input type=&quot;reset&quot; value=&quot;Clear&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;

There are a few things wrong with this:

Opening &lt;p&gt; with no &lt;/p&gt; (closing tag) anywhere
&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt; nested inside of an existing form isn't allowed and will cause submission issues (see &quot;Permitted content&quot; at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
The closing &lt;/form&gt; that exists matches the &lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;, but you're missing a &lt;/form&gt;
You don't have a message field anywhere

Here's the updated HTML with my suggested fixes:

        &lt;input type=&quot;reset&quot; value=&quot;Clear&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

As others have mentioned, it's not clear what the 500 error is, so that will need to be resolved before this will work. But here's a cleaned up version of the PHP. This has been simply tested at https://3v4l.org/WePRh, though it won't show the form or any input values, but it does prove that the script runs. This is formatted better, includes all form inputs, and should make things easier to work with:
&lt;?php
    // get all form values
    $input['Contact name'] = $_POST['contact_name'] ?? '';
    $input['Firm name'] = $_POST['firm_name'] ?? '';
    $input['Email'] = $_POST['email'] ?? '';
    $input['Job number'] = $_POST['job_number'] ?? '';
    $input['Document'] = $_POST['document'] ?? '';
    $input['Discount'] = $_POST['discount'] ?? '';
    $input['Message'] = $_POST['message'] ?? '';

    // generate the email content (i.e. each line is like &quot;Contact name: Mark&quot;)
    $formContent = '';
    foreach($input as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $formContent .= $key . &quot;: &quot; . $value . &quot;\n&quot;;
    }

    $to = &quot;my@email.com&quot;; // TODO: replace this with your email address
    $subject = &quot;Contact Form&quot;;
    
    /*
        Note that this was likely causing downstream issues. Most email clients (gmail, outlook) will mark emails as spam
        if you try to send an email from an email address that your server isn't configured to send from.
        See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17533863/how-to-configure-php-to-send-e-mail for more info.
        It's also safer to define an email address like &quot;no-reply@example.com&quot; to send your emails from.
    */
    $mailheader = &quot;From: no-reply@example.com&quot;;

    mail($to, $subject, $formContent, $mailheader) or die('Error sending email');

    // redirect to the thank you page
    // TODO: update this URL to be yours
    header('Location: http://www.example.com/thankyou.html');

    exit;
?&gt;

","To fix the issue with the mail.php file and ensure that all the requested data from the HTML form gets emailed correctly, you need to make a few modifications to the code.

Firstly, in the HTML form, you need to ensure that the names of the input fields match the variables used in the mail.php file. Currently, the names in the HTML form do not match the variables used in the PHP code.

Update the HTML form code as follows:

```html
<form action=""mail.php"" method=""POST"">
    <p class=""bodytextgrey"">
        Contact Name:<br />
        <input type=""text"" name=""name"" size=""50"" /><br />
        Firm Name:<br />
        <input type=""text"" name=""firm_name"" /><br /><br />
        E-mail: (Please enter the email address you would like the document to be sent to)<br /> 
        <input type=""text"" name=""email"" size=""50"" /><br />
        Job Number:<br />
        <input type=""text"" name=""job_number"" /><br /><br />
        Document you require:<br />
        <select name=""document_required"">
            <option value=""Data Sheet"">Data Sheet</option>
        </select><br /><br />
        Discount code:<br />
        <input type=""text"" name=""discount_code"" size=""20"" /><br /><br />
        <input type=""submit"" value=""Send""><input type=""reset"" value=""Clear"">
    </p>
</form>
```

Now, in the mail.php file, update the variable names to match the names used in the HTML form. Additionally, you can add code to redirect to a thank you page after the form is submitted.

Update the mail.php file as follows:

```php
<?php
$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
$firmName = $_POST['firm_name'];
$jobNumber = $_POST['job_number'];
$documentRequired = $_POST['document_required'];
$discountCode = $_POST['discount_code'];

$formcontent = ""From: $name \nFirm Name: $firmName \nE-mail: $email \nJob Number: $jobNumber \nDocument Required: $documentRequired \nDiscount Code: $discountCode"";
$recipient = ""MY EMAIL"";
$subject = ""Contact Form"";
$mailheader = ""From: $email \r\n"";

mail($recipient, $subject, $formcontent, $mailheader) or die(""Error!"");
header(""Location: thank_you.html""); // Replace with the actual URL of your thank you page
exit();
?>
```

Make sure to replace ""MY EMAIL"" with your actual email address.

With these modifications, the mail.php file will now correctly retrieve the data from the HTML form and email it to the specified recipient. After submission, it will redirect the user to the thank you page specified in the header() function.

73874791,How to create new list of lists using for loop,"I have two lists like
values = [['bert', '1234', 'xxx', 50], ['ernie', '5678', 'fff', 100]]
required = [1, 3]

I want to extract the required elements 1 and 3 from each list contained in values, to create a new list of lists like [['1234', 50], ['5678', 100]].
I was able to solve the problem with a list comprehension:
[[x[y] for y in required] for x in values]

But how can I write the equivalent with explicit for loops?
I tried:
new_list = []
for x in values:
    for y in required:
        new_list.append(x[y])

but the resulting new_list is a single flat list ['1234', 50, '5678', 100].
","You can make a new array before second looping, and then add x[y] in that array. Add the new array to the new_list after the second looping.
new_list = [] 
for x in values:
    temp_list = []
    for y in required:
       temp_list.append(x[y])
    new_list.append(temp_list)

","To create a new list of lists using explicit for loops, you can modify your code as follows:

```python
new_list = []
for x in values:
    new_sublist = []
    for y in required:
        new_sublist.append(x[y])
    new_list.append(new_sublist)
```

In this code, we initialize an empty list `new_list` to store the new lists. Then, for each sublist `x` in the `values` list, we create a new empty sublist `new_sublist`. Inside the inner for loop, we append the required elements `x[y]` to `new_sublist`. Finally, we append `new_sublist` to `new_list`.

This will give you the desired output: `[['1234', 50], ['5678', 100]]`.",0.7614423036575317,"python, list, for-loop, list-comprehension",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72843205,how to manage multiple 'executable and datadir profile' for parallelizing the launch of scrappers?,"I am using , and have difficulties to launch 4 scripts at the same time.
I have used theses variable for local browser
let CHROMIUM_DATA_DIR = `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir${this.cmd}`
let CHROMIUM_EXEC_PATH = `/Applications/Google-Chrome${this.cmd}.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`

I have multiplied by 4, the same datadir, et the same executable. I have just renamed the files/directories.
It does not work well. What would be your recomendation, to quickly scale the launch of the scrappers (). How could I install various chromes instance, et managing according datadir (to save some login session etc..)
tks

","Since you are using playwright, you can use persistent contexts.
You do not need to create your own data directories or executables by copying them, simply pass location of an empty directory when launching the browser and playwright will populate it itself, storing any session data.
I do not use node.js, but just to give an idea, sample code in python:
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir=r'C:\Users\me\Desktop\dir', headless=False)

    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto(&quot;http://playwright.dev&quot;)
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()

","To parallelize the launch of multiple scrapers with different profiles, you can follow these steps:

1. Install multiple instances of Google Chrome: 
   - Download and install Google Chrome from the official website for each instance you want to create.
   - During the installation process, make sure to choose a different installation directory for each instance.

2. Set up different data directories for each instance:
   - Create separate data directories for each instance where the profiles will be stored. For example:
     - `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir1`
     - `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir2`
     - `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir3`
     - `/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir4`
   - Make sure each data directory is unique and doesn't conflict with any existing directories.

3. Update the executable and data directory paths in your code:
   - Modify the `CHROMIUM_DATA_DIR` and `CHROMIUM_EXEC_PATH` variables to match the appropriate paths for each instance.
   - For example:
     - `CHROMIUM_DATA_DIR = '/Users/yo/dataDir/datadir1'`
     - `CHROMIUM_EXEC_PATH = '/Applications/Google-Chrome1.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'`
     - Repeat these lines for each instance, updating the numbers accordingly.

4. Launch the scrapers:
   - Make sure to launch each script with the appropriate data directory and executable path.
   - For example, if you have four scripts, you can launch them in parallel using a script or a task runner.
   - Each script should use a different data directory and executable path to avoid conflicts.

By following these steps, you should be able to parallelize the launch of your scrapers with separate profiles and data directories. This approach allows you to scale the launch of the scrapers quickly and manage them according to the specific data stored in each profile.",0.4812728762626648,"google-chrome, playwright, multiple-instances",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

In the modified code, I replaced `tibble(.x)` with `as.data.frame(.x)` to convert each element of the list back to a regular data frame. Then, I used `setNames` function to set the column names of each dataframe to their original names using `names(.x)`. This ensures that the original column names are preserved.

","To drop values based on a specific condition and replace them, you can use the `apply` method along with a custom function. Here's how you can achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create the initial dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'first': ['one', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'one'],
    'second': ['one', 'two', 'three', 'one', 'one'],
    'fourth': ['two', 'two', 'three', 'one', 'two'],
    'fifth': ['three', 'three', 'three', 'one', 'one']
})

# Define a function to drop values based on the condition
def drop_duplicates(row):
    for i in range(1, len(row)):
        if row[i] == row[i-1]:
            row[i] = pd.NA
    return row

# Apply the function to each row in the dataframe
df = df.apply(drop_duplicates, axis=1)

# Print the modified dataframe
print(df)
```

Output:
```
   ID first second fourth fifth
0   1   one    two  three  <NA>
1   2   one    two  three  <NA>
2   3   one  three   <NA>  <NA>
3   4   one   <NA>   <NA>  <NA>
4   5   one    two    one  <NA>
```

In this code, the `drop_duplicates` function iterates over each row and checks if the current value is the same as the previous value. If they are the same, it replaces the current value with `pd.NA`, which represents a missing value in pandas. The function is then applied to each row using the `apply` method with `axis=1` to apply it row-wise.",0.5601884126663208,"python, pandas, dataframe",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

        Button{

I couldn't get it to work in an acceptable time period, so I just created a second view:
struct MyBoundedButton: View {
    
    @Binding var text: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Button{
            HStack {

    }
}

This obviously works, but doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution. I tried to figure out how the SwiftUI framework does it, since there are plenty of examples of views which have very different initialisers (see the SwiftUI Button for instance). I still want to figure out how this might work, so since after work I'm trying to play around with generic view, but can't really get it to work. The following code doesn't work and is just to demonstrate the line of thinking I'm following:
struct MyButton&lt;T&gt;: View {
        
        var text: T
        
        var body: some View {
            Button{

                }   
            }
        }

extension MyButton where text == Binding&lt;String&gt;{
    init(text: Binding&lt;String&gt;)
}

extension MyButton where text == String{
    init(text: String)

Does someone have an idea how this could be implemented or how Apple does this in their SwiftUI library?

            }
            if let text = pureText {

            }
        }
    }
}

Although the binding in this case doesn't make much sense... binding is when you are changing the value of the variable and want to pass UP to the ParentView, a binding inside a Text(text) that will never change doesn't make sense to me, but this is how you done with multiple initializers.
","To make the view generic and usable with both `TYPE` and `Binding<TYPE>`, you can modify the `MyButton` struct as follows:

```swift
struct MyButton<T>: View {
    @Binding var text: T
    
    init(text: Binding<T>) {
        _text = text
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            HStack {
                Text(""\(text)"")
            }
        }) {
            EmptyView()
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `text` property is defined as a generic type `T`, and it is bound to a `Binding<T>` using `@Binding`. The `init` method takes a `Binding<T>` parameter and assigns it to the `_text` property.

To use the `MyButton` view with a `String` or a `Binding<String>`, you can create instances of `MyButton` as follows:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var text = """"
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            MyButton(text: ""Button with String"")
            MyButton(text: $text)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the first `MyButton` instance is created with a `String` argument, while the second one is created with a `Binding<String>` using the `$` prefix to access the binding of the `text` property.

By making the view generic and using `Binding<T>`, you can now use the `MyButton` view with different types and bindings, providing a more flexible and elegant solution.",0.8019112944602966,"generics, swiftui",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73093527,Find index in array based on given value,"I have a sorted array of numbers with array length as n. For a given item k find index i in the sorted array where elements from index i to n are greater than the given item k. If there is no index present then return -1
This is my program:
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
     int x = -1;
     for(int i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++) {
       if(arr[i] &gt; k) {
           x = i; break;
       }
     }
     return x;
}

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), and I want to reduce it further.
","Since the array is sorted, use binary search for a time complexity of O(log N).
public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low &lt;= high) {
        int mid = low + high &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
        if(arr[mid] &gt; k) high = mid - 1;
        else low = mid + 1;
    }
    return low == arr.length ? -1 : low;
}

","To reduce the time complexity of the given program, we can use a binary search algorithm instead of a linear search. Here's the modified program:

public static int getIndex(int[] arr, int k) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;
    int result = -1;

    while (low <= high) {

        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

In this approach, we use a binary search to find the first occurrence of an element greater than k. We initialize low as 0 and high as the last index of the array. In each iteration, we calculate the mid index and compare the element at the mid index with k. If the element is greater, we update the result and move to the left half of the array. If the element is smaller or equal, we move to the right half of the array.

The time complexity of this approach is O(log n), which is more efficient than the previous linear search approach.",0.8470882177352905,"java, arrays, algorithm",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
74027109,"How to create a dictionary with two querysets from different models, using a common DateTimeField as the dictionary keys?","I would like to create a dictionary from two models with a field dt in common. This field should be the dictionary keys, and fields value and last the keys's value. What is the most efficient way to do that ?

    value = models.FloatField(default=0)
    dt = models.DateTimeField()

class Price(models.Model):
    last = models.FloatField(default=0)
    dt = models.DateTimeField()

The desired output would be something like this :
{
    &quot;2022-10-11T00:00:00Z&quot;: {
        &quot;value&quot;: 151.05,

        &quot;value&quot;: 154,
        &quot;last&quot;: 1.23,
    }
}

I could iterate through each dictionaries of the querysets with a nested loop and search the items with a common dt then populate key:value inside a new dictionary, but it's not elegant and I don't believe it's efficient.
","This will do but not so sure about efficiency.
import datetime
balances = Balance.objects.annotate(date_only=Cast('dt',DateField())).values(&quot;date_only&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)
prices = Price.objects.annotate(date_only=Cast('dt',DateField())).values(&quot;date_only&quot;, &quot;last&quot;)


data = {}
for (balance, price) in zip(balances, prices):
    str_date = balance['date_only'].strftime(&quot;%Y/%m/%d&quot;)
    if balance['date_only'] == price['date_only']:
        data[str_date] = {}
        data[str_date]['last'] = price['last']
        data[str_date]['value'] = balance['value']


print(data)

","To create a dictionary with two querysets from different models using a common DateTimeField as the dictionary keys, you can use the following approach:

1. Fetch the querysets from the models:
```python
balance_queryset = Balance.objects.all()
price_queryset = Price.objects.all()
```

2. Combine the two querysets into a single queryset using the `union()` method:
```python
combined_queryset = balance_queryset.union(price_queryset)
```

3. Iterate over the combined queryset and create the dictionary:
```python
result_dict = {}
for item in combined_queryset:
    dt = item.dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
    if dt not in result_dict:
        result_dict[dt] = {}
    if isinstance(item, Balance):
        result_dict[dt]['value'] = item.value
    elif isinstance(item, Price):
        result_dict[dt]['last'] = item.last
```

This code snippet checks the type of each item in the combined queryset and assigns the corresponding value to the dictionary based on the model it belongs to.

The resulting `result_dict` will have the desired structure with the DateTimeField values as keys and the corresponding values from the models.

","The error message you are encountering indicates that the installation of the selenium package is failing due to insufficient permissions. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. In a new code cell, type `!pip install --user selenium` and run the cell.
   - The `--user` option allows the package to be installed in your user directory, which usually doesn't require administrative privileges.

73195147,Converting shift-jis encoded file to to utf-8 in c++,"I am trying with below code to convert from shift-jis file to utf-8, but when we open the output file it has corrupted characters, looks like something is missed out here, any thoughts?
// From file

wstring str(pUTF16);

// convert wide char to multi byte utf-8 before writing to a file
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out);
string result = string();
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0));
char* ptr = &amp;result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File &lt;&lt; result;

File.close();

","There are multiple problems.
The first problem is that when you are writing the output file, you need to set it to binary for the same reason you need to do so when reading the input.
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);

The second problem is that when you are reading the input file, you are only reading the bytes of the input stream and treat them like a string. However, those bytes do not have a terminating null character. If you call MultiByteToWideChar with a -1 length, it infers the input string length from the terminating null character, which is missing in your case. That means both utf16size and the contents of  pUTF16 are already wrong. Add it manually after reading the file:
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

The last problem is that you are using CP_ACP. That means &quot;the current code page&quot;. In your question, you were specifically asking how to convert Shift-JIS. The code page Windows uses for its closes equivalent to what is commonly called &quot;Shift-JIS&quot; is 932 (you can look that up on wikipedia for example). So use 932 instead of CP_ACP:
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

Additionally, there is no reason to create wstring str(pUTF16). Just use pUTF16 directly in the WideCharToMultiByte calls.
Also, I'm not sure how kosher char *ptr = &amp;result[0] is. I personally would not create a string specifically as a buffer for this.
Here is the corrected code. I would personally not write it this way, but I don't want to impose my coding ideology on you, so I made only the changes necessary to fix it:
// From file
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(&quot;rb&quot;));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

// convert multibyte to  wide char
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

// convert wide char to multi byte utf-8 before writing to a file
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
string result;
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0));
char *ptr = &amp;result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File &lt;&lt; ptr;

File.close();

Also, you have a memory leak -- lpszBuf and pUTF16 are not cleaned up.
","The code you provided seems to have a few issues that could be causing the corrupted characters in the output file. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Ensure that you are opening the shift-jis file in binary mode by using ""rb"" as the second parameter in `_tfopen`. This will prevent any newline character conversions that may occur in text mode.

2. Instead of using `CP_ACP` in `MultiByteToWideChar`, use `CP_SHIFT_JIS` to correctly convert the shift-jis encoded text to wide characters.

3. Instead of using `CP_UTF8` in `WideCharToMultiByte`, use `CP_UTF8` as the first parameter to convert the wide characters to UTF-8 encoding.

4. When resizing the `result` string, subtract 1 from the size to exclude the null terminator.

Here's an updated version of the code with the suggested changes:

```cpp
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(""rb""));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);

int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_SHIFT_JIS, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_SHIFT_JIS, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

wstring str(pUTF16);

fstream File(""filepath"", std::ios::out);
string result;
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0) - 1);
char* ptr = &result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File << result;

File.close();
```

With these changes, the code should correctly convert the shift-jis encoded file to UTF-8 and write it to the output file without any corrupted characters.",0.7036088705062866,"c++, winapi, visual-c++, character-encoding, shift-jis",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Delay won't do the job in this case. The reason is the image only load when you're in the page.
There's a trick to connect faster which is use the preload attribute. This is a technique for improving loading speed of your site.
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; as=&quot;image&quot; href=&quot;image.png&quot; /&gt;
By putting that line to the head tag (just like other script tags), you're telling browsers that this is a high priority resource, so load it as soon as possible.
More info here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload
","To ensure that the image is fully loaded before navigating to the page, you can make use of the `onload` event of the image element. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

1. In your HTML, add an `id` attribute to the `<img>` tag to easily access it in your TypeScript code:

```html
<img id=""morImage"" class=""mor-image"" src=""../../assets/images/Mor.png"" alt=""mor"">
```

2. In your TypeScript code, modify the `navigate()` function to include an event listener for the `load` event of the image:

```typescript
navigate(name: string, title: string) {
  Swal.fire({
    position: 'center',
    icon: 'success',
    title: `You go to the page ${title}`,
    showConfirmButton: false,
    timer: 1500,
  });

  const morImage = document.getElementById('morImage') as HTMLImageElement;
  morImage.onload = () => {
    this.router.navigate([`${name}`]);
  };
}
```

With this modification, the `navigate()` function will only trigger the navigation after the image has finished loading. This ensures that the image is fully loaded before navigating to the desired page.",0.5387897491455078,"angular, image",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72957907,"Inability to use ""MaxBy"" on ""Where"" clauses with EFCore + MySQL","My database has the following structure:
public class Ticket
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public List&lt;History&gt; Histories { get; set; }
}

public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class History
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}

The user provides the name of the property to filter by and the query string. What I had in mind is that I needed to allow the users to query Tickets by a computed property in Tickets, such as
public Employee LatestEmployee
{
    get =&gt; History.MaxBy(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).Employee;
}

I was suggested to leave the Entity models strictly to reflect the db structure and use a separate class to represent queryable properties of the entity:
public class TicketSummary
{
    public int TicketId {get;set;}
    public Employee LatestEmployee {get;set;}
}

public IQueryable&lt;TicketSummary&gt; BuildSummaryQuery()
{
    return _context.Tickets.Select(t =&gt; new TicketSummary
        {
            TicketId = t.Id,
            LatestEmployee = t.History.MaxBy(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).Employee
        });
}

And then call BuildSummaryQuery().Where(x=&gt;x.LatestEmployee.Name == &quot;Batman&quot;). However, I found out MaxBy() could not be translated into a valid query on the MySQL Database. I keep getting a The LINQ expression could not be translated. How can I work out a similar, valid query?
","As per StriplingWarrior's comment (What is the correct way to use computed properties with Dynamic LINQ?), instead of using MaxBy(), I successfully managed to create a valid query using OrderByDescending() and FirstOrDefault()
First, instead of computed properties on the entity, the actual queryable entity is
public class TicketSummary
{
    public string TicketId { get; set; }
    public History? LatestHistory { get; set; }
}

Then, the query is composed as follows
//Includes the tables needed for the filterable properties.
var firstQuery = _context.Tickets.Include(t =&gt; t.Histories).ThenInclude(h =&gt; h.Employee);

//Creates an IQueryable&lt;TicketSummary&gt; with the latest History entity
var ticketSummariesQueryable = firstQuery.Select(x =&gt; new TicketSummary
{
    TicketId = x.Id.ToString(),
    LatestHistory = x.Histories.OrderByDescending(x=&gt;x.Timestamp).FirstOrDefault()
});

//Finally apply the filters given by the user
var filteredQuery = ticketSummariesQueryable.Where(ts=&gt;ts.LatestHistory.Employee.Name == &quot;Black Canary&quot;);

This way the most recent History is stored on LatestHistory to be promptly used on queries.
","The issue you are facing arises from the fact that the `MaxBy` method is not directly supported by EF Core and MySQL. However, you can achieve a similar result by using a combination of `OrderByDescending`, `FirstOrDefault`, and `Include` methods.

To fix the problem, follow these steps:

1. Create a new class, let's call it `TicketSummary`, to represent the queryable properties of the `Ticket` entity:

```csharp
public class TicketSummary
{
    public int TicketId { get; set; }
    public Employee LatestEmployee { get; set; }
}
```

2. Modify your `BuildSummaryQuery` method to return `IQueryable<TicketSummary>`:

```csharp
public IQueryable<TicketSummary> BuildSummaryQuery()
{
    return _context.Tickets
        .Include(t => t.Histories)
        .Select(t => new TicketSummary
        {
            TicketId = t.Id,
            LatestEmployee = t.Histories.OrderByDescending(h => h.Timestamp)
                .Select(h => h.Employee)
                .FirstOrDefault()
        });
}
```

Here, the `Include` method is used to eagerly load the `Histories` collection to ensure that the necessary data is available for the query.

3. Finally, you can filter the `TicketSummary` query by the `LatestEmployee.Name` property:

```csharp
var query = BuildSummaryQuery().Where(x => x.LatestEmployee.Name == ""Batman"");
```

By using `OrderByDescending` and `FirstOrDefault`, we can achieve a similar result to `MaxBy` by ordering the `Histories` collection by `Timestamp` in descending order and selecting the first employee.

Please note that the above solution assumes that the `Histories` collection is not very large. If it contains a large number of records, consider optimizing the query to improve performance.",0.7942116260528564,"c#, mysql, dynamic-linq, ef-core-6.0",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

I was searching for similar problem and found that when you use make command you should not write make -j6 check but simply make , but this didn't help and using --with-external-capnp flag also didn't help. So the question is how to prevent running tests during the build.
","When cross-compiling, you need to first build and install Cap'n Proto on the host machine, so that the commands capnp and capnpc-c++ are available on the command line.
Once you've done that, you can cross-compile. Pass --with-external-capnp to ./configure when configuring cross-compiling, to tell it to use the installed copy of the tools rather than the self-built copy. Also make sure you make clean or build in a different directory so that the build doesn't accidentally try to use the host-built objects.
If this &quot;doesn't help&quot;, you'll need to provide more detail on what you're doing and what went wrong.
","To prevent running tests during the build process of capnproto library, you can use the `--disable-tests` flag when configuring the build. Here are the steps to fix the problem:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the capnproto source code directory.

2. Run the configuration command with the `--disable-tests` flag:
   ```
   ./configure --disable-tests
   ```

   This command will generate the necessary build files without including the tests.

3. Once the configuration is complete, you can proceed with the build process:
   ```
   make
   ```

   This will compile the capnproto library without running the tests.

4. After the build finishes, you can install the library:
   ```
   make install
   ```

   This will install the compiled capnproto library on your system.

","In the controller :
@SecurityRequirement(name = &quot;bearerAuth&quot;) has to name the right requirement name :
try :
@SecurityRequirement(name = &quot;Bearer Authentication&quot;)
Regards
","To fix the issue of adding Bearer Tokens to Swagger not working in Spring Boot, you need to make a few modifications in your code.

1. In your SwaggerConfig class, update the @SecurityScheme annotation as follows:
```java
@Configuration
@SecurityScheme(
        name = ""bearerAuth"",
        type = SecuritySchemeType.HTTP,
        scheme = ""bearer"",
        bearerFormat = ""JWT""

                        new SecurityScheme().type(SecurityScheme.Type.HTTP).scheme(""bearer"").bearerFormat(""JWT"")));
    }
}
```
In the updated code, the name of the security scheme is set to ""bearerAuth"" to match the SecurityRequirement in the controller.

2. In the controller, update the @SecurityRequirement annotation as follows:
```java
@CrossOrigin(""*"")
@RestController
@RequestMapping(""/api/v1/tutors/"")
@SecurityRequirement(name = ""bearerAuth"")
public class TutorController {
    //...
}
```
Ensure that the name in the @SecurityRequirement annotation matches the name specified in the @SecurityScheme annotation in the SwaggerConfig class.

With these changes, Swagger will now enforce the Bearer token authentication for all endpoints in the TutorController. If you try to submit a POST request without a valid Bearer token, you should receive a 401 Unauthorized response instead of a 200 Success response.

Make sure to properly configure and validate the Bearer token in your authentication logic to ensure the security of your application.",0.6111690402030945,"spring-boot, jwt, swagger, swagger-ui, bearer-token",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

You can easily start a new gradle project by following these simple steps.

mkdir gradleExp
 cd gradleExp
gradle init  # 1.basic 1.groovy random name
update the empty build.gradle with the following

}
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()

gradle dependencies # to list all
gradle dependencies --configuration compileClasspath  # reduce output to show only Compile classpath for source set 'main'

NOTE: missing either google() or mavenCentral() will show some failure in the result shown.
","To retrieve the dependency tree of a library using Gradle, you can use the `dependencies` task with the `--configuration` option.

To get the dependency tree of the `com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0` artifact, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Gradle project.

2. Execute the following command:

   For Unix/Mac:
   ```
   ./gradlew dependencies --configuration compileClasspath | grep ""com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0""
   ```

   For Windows:
   ```
   gradlew dependencies --configuration compileClasspath | findstr ""com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0""
   ```

   This command will generate the dependency tree for the `compileClasspath` configuration and filter the output to show only the dependencies related to `com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0`.

3. The output will show the complete dependency tree for the specified artifact. It will display the versions of the transitive dependencies, along with their dependencies.

Note that the above command assumes you have the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) set up in your project. If you don't, you can use the `gradle` command instead of `./gradlew`.

Make sure to replace `24.4.0` with the actual version of `firebase-firestore` you want to inspect.",0.7365630269050598,"java, maven, gradle, android-gradle-plugin, build.gradle",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","I think you can access it via counterForm's elements and you need to set what kind of html element is counterForm
you can simply use it in this way :
const counterForm = document.getElementById(&quot;counter__form&quot;) as HTMLFormElement;
counterForm.elements[0];

","The issue you are facing is because the `event.target` property is of type `EventTarget`, which does not have an index signature. Therefore, you cannot access elements by index like `event.target[0]`.

To fix this problem, you need to explicitly cast `event.target` to the appropriate type. In your case, you want to access an input element, so you should cast it to `HTMLInputElement`. Here's how you can modify your code to resolve the issue:

```typescript
counterForm.addEventListener(""submit"", event => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const target = event.target as HTMLFormElement;
  const inputElement = target[0] as HTMLInputElement;
  if (inputElement) {
    console.log(inputElement);
  }
});
```

In the above code, we first cast `event.target` to `HTMLFormElement` since you are listening to the ""submit"" event on a form element. Then, we cast `target[0]` to `HTMLInputElement` to access the first input element in the form.

By doing these explicit type assertions, TypeScript will understand the types correctly, and the error should be resolved.",0.6258304715156555,typescript,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

but it could be quite large, the names would vary in number and suffix, .number.suffix is a group to average throughout.
I would like to average the contents of prefix.1.suffix with prefix.3.suffix with prefix.5.suffix and put these averages in a new column prefix.135.suffix
I have tried
avg135 = df_ex.columns[(df.columns.str.contains('alpha.1') | df.columns.str.contains('alpha.3') | 
                           df.columns.str.contains('alpha.5')].tolist()

to create a list of columns to slice the data frame because there could be more than the headers seen here and I want the option to select a subset. But the rest, grouping similar suffix and averaging them is a bit out of my programming skills.
","You can use MultiIndex:
# Split each column header into a 3-tuple, e.g.: (&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;try&quot;),
# (&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;test&quot;), etc.
df_ex.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([col.split(&quot;.&quot;) for col in df_ex.columns])

# Group by prefix and suffix and take the mean of each column group
result = df_ex.groupby(level=[0,2], axis=1).mean()

# Rename the resulting columns
result.columns = [f&quot;{a}.135.{b}&quot; for a, b in result.columns]

","To fix the problem and calculate the average of columns with incremented names in the middle, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a list of columns to slice the data frame based on the desired pattern. In this case, the pattern is ""prefix.number.suffix"" where the numbers are incremented.

```python
avg_cols = [col for col in df_ex.columns if col.split('.')[1].isdigit()]
```

2. Slice the data frame using the list of columns.

```python
df_avg = df_ex[avg_cols]
```

3. Calculate the average of each row in the sliced data frame and store the result in a new column.

```python
df_avg['prefix.135.suffix'] = df_avg.mean(axis=1)
```

4. Merge the calculated average column back into the original data frame.

```python
df_ex = pd.concat([df_ex, df_avg['prefix.135.suffix']], axis=1)
```

The resulting data frame will have the original data along with the new column ""prefix.135.suffix"" containing the average of the desired columns.

```python

74065917,Looking to get the frequency of an int array through a hashmap,"public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0 || k &lt;= 0) return new int[0];
    Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; freqMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (int currNum : nums) freqMap.put(currNum, freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1);

I don't understand what the .getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1); is doing, but it seems to calculate the frequency properly. I'd like some clearance on this method please and how exactly it's working.
","
The getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue) method of Map
interface, implemented by HashMap class is used to get the value
mapped with specified key. If no value is mapped with the provided key
then the default value is returned.
Syntax: default V getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)
Parameters: This method accepts two parameters:

key: which is the key of the element whose value has to be obtained.

defaultValue: which is the default value that has to be returned, if no value is mapped with the specified key.


Return Value: This method returns value mapped with the specified key, otherwise default value is returned.

Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashmap-getordefaultkey-defaultvalue-method-in-java-with-examples/
So, by using that method, first, you're trying to get key's value from the freqMap. If you can find it in map, then you're adding 1 to it and putting it back to freqMap. So, that means that you encountered this key before. Otherwise, that method , .getOrDefault(), returns you default value, which is 0, then you're adding 1 to it since you encountered it recently. And putting that value 1 to back to map. So, in the future, when you see that key again, you'll get it's value 1 that you added to the map before, will increase it to 2, and will put it back into the map.
","In the given code snippet, the `.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1` is used to calculate the frequency of each number in the `nums` array and store it in the `freqMap` HashMap. 

Let's break down the code to understand how it works:

1. `Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();`: This line initializes a HashMap called `freqMap` with Integer keys and Integer values. This map will store the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.

2. `for (int currNum : nums)`: This is an enhanced for loop that iterates over each element `currNum` in the `nums` array.

3. `freqMap.put(currNum, freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1)`: Here, `freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)` retrieves the value associated with the key `currNum` from the `freqMap`. If the key does not exist, it returns the default value `0`. Then, `+1` is added to this value, representing the frequency of `currNum`. Finally, `freqMap.put(currNum, ...)` stores the updated frequency value in the `freqMap` for the key `currNum`.

This code essentially counts the frequency of each number in the `nums` array and stores it in the `freqMap`. The `.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1` ensures that the frequency is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the number.",0.6578101515769958,java,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

    Add-Content -Path $outputfile -Value $tableValues
}
```

In this updated script, we added a `$tableMode` variable to keep track of whether we are inside the table or not. We also introduced a `$tableValues` array to store the extracted values from the table.

We iterate through each line of the file and check if we are inside the table or not. If we are inside the table, we check for the end of the table (`$find3`) and append the extracted values to the `$tableValues` array. If we are not inside the table, we check for the start of the table (`$find1`) and set the `$tableMode` to true.

Finally, after processing all lines, we use `Set-Content` to write the modified lines to the output file. Then, we use `Add-Content` to append the extracted table values to the output file.

This should result in the desired output file format with the table values separated by semicolons and without any white spaces.",0.7093236446380615,powershell,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","The way you are trying to handle the element with innerHTML is not wrong, but then you have a string that you have to work with and the only way to modify this string is using Regex. But there is an easier way if you just create all required elements.


const p = document.createElement('p');
const span = document.createElement('span');
span.innerText = 'Or ';
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.innerText = 'make your renewal payment';
a.href = 'https://example.com';

p.append(span);
p.append(a);

document.body.append(p);



","To fix the problem, you need to make a few adjustments to your code. Here's the modified code:

```javascript
var newp = document.createElement('p');
newp.innerHTML = '<span>Or</span> <a>make your renewal payment</a>';

var linkdiv = document.querySelector('.renewnow'); /* parent div */
var getlink = linkdiv.getElementsByTagName('a')[0]; /* select the first 'a' element */

getlink.href = '/newa';
```

Explanation:
1. Create a new paragraph element using `document.createElement('p')`.
2. Assign the HTML content to the `innerHTML` property of the paragraph element.
3. Use `querySelector` to select the parent div with the class name `.renewnow`.
4. Use `getElementsByTagName` to select all 'a' elements inside the parent div. Since there is only one 'a' element, you can directly access it using `[0]`.
5. Set the `href` attribute of the 'a' element to `'/newa'`.

// What would make sense:
bar.remove(&quot;a&quot;); // remove the element &quot;a&quot;
bar.removeAll(foo); // remove all the elements in foo

In short, in a List&lt;String&gt;, you're usually going to be calling remove(String) or removeAll(Collection&lt;String&gt;), not remove(List&lt;String&gt;), which won't really do what you want.
","The warning you are seeing in IntelliJ is not a bug, but rather a valid concern raised by the IDE. 

In the code snippet you provided, the warning is thrown because you are trying to remove the entire `foo` list from the `bar` list using the `remove` method. The `remove` method in Java's `List` interface expects an object to be removed from the list, not another list itself.

To fix this warning, you need to modify the `remove` statement to remove individual elements from `foo` that are present in `bar`. Here's an updated version of your code:

```java
public class Foo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> foo = Arrays.asList(""a"", ""b"", ""c"");
        List<String> bar = new ArrayList<>(foo);
        bar.removeAll(foo);
    }
}
```

In the updated code, the `removeAll` method is used to remove all elements in `foo` from `bar`. This method takes a collection as an argument and removes all occurrences of its elements from the list.

By making this change, the warning should no longer be present in IntelliJ.",0.6819680333137512,"java, intellij-idea, intellij-14",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73410047,Displaying random RGB pixels in Python,"I am starting a little project and I am having some difficulty in finding the answer that I am looking for. I don't really know exactly what terms I should be using to search, and couldn't find anything similar so I am sorry if this has been asked previously.
I am essentially trying to have a 2D plot of a set size, 300x300 for example full of random RGB pixels. I have figured out how to plot them with imshow and remove the axis labels so far, but it looks odd like it is zoomed in too far. Also, I know I can use RGB arguements in imshow, but the matplotlib manual touches on it, but never gives any examples. The closest cmap I have found to RGB is hsv so I am using that for now until I find the RGB solution.
Can anyone help me with assigning a random RGB value to each pixel instead of using cmap, and maybe adjusting the apparent size of the image so the pixels are less &quot;zoomed in&quot;? I am open to using something other than imshow for flexibility, it is just the only thing I found to do what I want. Thank you very much in advance!
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
from numpy import random

Z = random.random((300,300))
plt.imshow(Z, cm.get_cmap(&quot;hsv&quot;), interpolation='nearest')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

","Here's how you do it with PIL:
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

data = (np.random.random( (300,300,3) ) * 256).astype(np.uint8)
img = Image.fromarray(data)
img.show()
img.save('rand.png')

","To fix the problem and display random RGB pixels in Python, you can modify your code as follows:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate random RGB values for each pixel
Z = np.random.rand(300, 300, 3)

# Display the RGB pixels using imshow
plt.imshow(Z, interpolation='nearest')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Explanation of the changes made:

1. Import the `numpy` library as `np` for convenience.
2. Instead of using `random.random()` from `numpy`, use `np.random.rand()` to generate random RGB values for each pixel. `np.random.rand()` generates random numbers in the range [0, 1) for each channel (red, green, blue) of the RGB value.
3. Remove the `cm.get_cmap(""hsv"")` argument from `imshow`. By default, `imshow` will interpret the RGB values correctly.
4. Adjust the size of the image by setting the dimensions of the `Z` array to `300x300`.

With these changes, you should be able to display a 2D plot of random RGB pixels without using a colormap and without the image appearing zoomed in.",0.5605884194374084,"python, matplotlib, rgb, imshow",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

Axios Error

details of request/response


Response of login

","Update 2
Having seen the code, I think the problem is here:
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

axios.defaults.baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

if (localStorage.getItem('user')) {
    const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${user?.accessToken}`;
}

this will read the axios.defaults.headers when the helpers/axios.js file is loaded. This is why axios.get('/users'); only works on second load, or rather only when the authentication is already loaded into localStorage. A change to the user object or a local storage will not update since this code only runs once at the beginning, the change to axios.defaults.headers needs to be dynamic.
Update
if setTimeout didn't work that could be due to a different issue. Also, if your request works a second time, but it also works if the authentication is passed directly, it seems to me that it has something to do with the authentication being handled implicitly.
I think what's happening is that you are creating multiple instances of axios and relying on shared authentication
// create single axios instance
export const api = axios.create({
   withCredentials: true,
   baseURL: BASE_URL // optional
})

// then use
await api.post('/auth/login', {
  username: username,
  password: password
});

// and 
await api.get('/users');

This might make the axios instance remember the authentication information between calls. It may still require handling race condition if you have an app that doesn't wait on the login request to finish.

I think this is just an issue with a race condition
POST:/login and GET:/users requests appear to be done in parallel.
onMounted( async () =&gt; {
  // this should wait until the `login` has been handled
  const response = await axios.get('/users');
  users.value = response.data;
})

I don't see how you call login so can't offer the the exact solution, but if you can store the login request state as a reactive variable, you can do something like
watch: {
  loginState:{
    immediate: true
    handler(value){
      if (value === LOADED) {
        const response = await axios.get('/users');
        users.value = response.data;
      }
    }
  }
})

here's what the changes to the authStore might look like
export const STATES = {
  INIT:&quot;INIT&quot;,
  PROCESSING:&quot;PROCESSING&quot;,
  ERROR:&quot;ERROR&quot;,
  LOADED:&quot;LOADED&quot;,
}
export const loginState = ref(STATES.INIT);

async login (username, password) {
    loginState.value = STATES.PROCESSING
    try{
      const response = await axios.post('/auth/login', {
        username: username,
        password: password
      });
      loginState.value = STATES.LOADED
      this.user = response.data;
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(this.user));

      await router.push('/');
    }catch(e){
      // handle error
      loginState.value = STATES.ERROR
    }
},

","The issue you are facing is related to the order of execution of your code. In the `login` function, you are redirecting to the home page before the authentication is completed, and that's why you are getting a 401 error when trying to fetch data from the API.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the authentication is completed before redirecting to the home page. One way to achieve this is by using a promise chain or async/await. Here's an updated version of the `login` function:

```javascript
async login(username, password) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/auth/login', {
      username: username,
      password: password
    });

    this.user = response.data;
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(this.user));

    // Wait for authentication to complete before redirecting
    await this.fetchUserData();

    await router.push('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
},
```

In this updated version, I added a new function called `fetchUserData` that fetches the user data. You can call this function after the authentication is completed and before redirecting. Here's an example implementation of `fetchUserData`:

```javascript
async fetchUserData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/users');
    users.value = response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

By using `await this.fetchUserData()` before redirecting, you ensure that the user data is fetched before rendering the home page. This should fix the issue of not fetching data from the API in the first render.

Additionally, make sure that your server-side authentication logic is correctly handling the login request and returning the appropriate response status code (e.g., 200 for successful login, 401 for unauthorized).",0.6195247769355774,"vue.js, axios, vuejs3, vue-router",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

     t_statistic <- A[[subtest]]$statistic

And you filter the data in the Power Query Editor.(Lignes filtrées = Filtered rows)
You will get the data first then you filter the data,
or you filter the data first the you get the data?

","Actually, both are data which contains different values.
PowerBI is operating data from top to bottom. So, it gets the data from Source, then navigates to the selected table, then applies filters and some other jobs.
So, getting the data first and then filtering it is meaningful because you can see all the data changes in the Edit Query page.
But getting the data after filtering it in query may also meaningful because all the filtering is handled in database and if you have a good infrastructure, your data will come faster.
And the best case approach is: &quot;using filtering in queries is OK but don't be complex on your database queries&quot;. So, there is no correct answer for your question, you should just use a little bit of this and that depend on the quality of your data.
","In Power BI with Direct Query, the process of getting data and applying filters is slightly different compared to other data loading methods like Import or DirectQuery. 

When you connect to a data source using DirectQuery, Power BI doesn't load the data into its internal data model. Instead, it sends queries directly to the data source to retrieve the required data. This means that the data is fetched from the source on-demand, based on the visualizations and filters applied.

In the scenario you mentioned, when you apply filters in the Power Query Editor (also known as Power Query Transformation), the filtering is performed on the data that is retrieved from the data source. So, the data is fetched first, and then the filters are applied to the fetched data.

To summarize:
1. Power BI sends a query to the data source to retrieve the required data based on the applied filters.
2. The data source returns the filtered data to Power BI.
3. Power BI applies additional transformations or calculations if specified in the Power Query Editor.
4. Finally, the transformed data is loaded into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

It's important to note that in DirectQuery mode, the actual data resides in the data source, and Power BI only fetches the necessary data based on the applied filters. This ensures that the latest and most up-to-date data is always available for analysis in Power BI.",0.6812151670455933,"powerbi, directquery",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","To change the default behavior of using the tab key to move to the next input field in PySimpleGUI and instead use the enter key, you can utilize the `return_keyboard_events=True` parameter when creating your input elements.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

layout = [
    [sg.Text('Field 1'), sg.Input(key='-FIELD1-', return_keyboard_events=True)],
    [sg.Text('Field 2'), sg.Input(key='-FIELD2-', return_keyboard_events=True)],
    [sg.Button('Submit')]
]

window = sg.Window('Form', layout)

while True:
    event, values = window.read()

    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED:
        break

    if event == 'Submit':
        # Handle form submission
        field1_value = values['-FIELD1-']
        field2_value = values['-FIELD2-']
        print(f'Field 1: {field1_value}')
        print(f'Field 2: {field2_value}')

    # Move to the next input field on pressing the enter key
    if event.endswith('\r'):
        next_element = window.FindElementWithFocus().TKEntry.tk_focusNext()
        if next_element:
            next_element.focus_set()

window.close()
```

In this example, we set the `return_keyboard_events=True` parameter for both input fields. This allows us to capture the enter key press event. On pressing enter, we use the `TKEntry.tk_focusNext()` method to get the next input field and set the focus to it using the `focus_set()` method.

Basically I have a map&lt;enum class, vector&lt;struct*&gt;&gt;. I want to pass the whole map without the vectors' contents being modifiable.
I need the structs as pointers, because I save references to some of them e.g. to the player instance and they'll get invalidated otherwhise.
It seems I can neither pass the map nor the vectors by reference. So this..
    std::map&lt;myEnum, std::vector&lt;const myStruct&amp;&gt;&gt; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

..aswell as..
    const std::map&lt;myEnum, std::vector&lt;myStruct*&gt;&gt;&amp; getMap() {
        return myMap;
    }

doesnt work.
Is there any way to solve this?
Sorry if the question is dumb, I'm kinda new to C++ and often don't know what to search for.
Thanks for you help!
","First of all, you should declare the member function itself const, otherwise it can't pick the member function for the const circumstance when the object itself is const.
Second, you don't have to think about the exact typing, you can let the compiler figure it out by saying const auto&amp;. then it will return a constant reference, so it won't be modifiable:
const auto&amp; GameLogic::getMap() const {
    return myMap;
}

","To make the vectors unmodifiable when passing the map, you can use C++11's `std::reference_wrapper` from the `<functional>` header. Here's how you can modify your code:

```cpp
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

std::map<myEnum, std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<const myStruct>>> getMap() {
    std::map<myEnum, std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<const myStruct>>> myMap;
    // Populate your map here
    return myMap;
}
```

In this modified code, the vectors in the map are of type `std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<const myStruct>>`. The `std::reference_wrapper` allows you to store references to the `myStruct` objects without modifying them. By using `const`, you ensure that the objects cannot be modified through the references.

Now, when you pass the map to another function or assign it to another variable, the vectors' contents will be unmodifiable. However, keep in mind that the map itself can still be modified (e.g., adding or removing elements), but the objects within the vectors will remain unmodifiable.

Note that `std::reference_wrapper` is a lightweight wrapper that behaves like a reference, so you can still use it as if it were a reference.",0.6214763522148132,c++,gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Based on the code provided, it appears that the issue lies with the order of the code blocks inside the `setOnClickListener` method. 

To fix the problem, you need to swap the order of the animations and the visibility settings. Currently, you are setting the visibility to `GONE` before starting the animations, which means the buttons will disappear immediately without any animation.

Here's the modified code:

```java
addFloatingBtn.setOnClickListener(view -> {
    if (!isFloatingActionBtnVisible) {
        // Starting Animation
        addVideoFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);
        addNotesFloatingBtn.startAnimation(fromBottom);
        addFloatingBtn.startAnimation(rotateOpen);

        // Delay the visibility change until the animation finishes
        new Handler().postDelayed(() -> {
            // Making Buttons Visible
            addVideoFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            addNotesFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        }, 200); // Adjust the delay time as needed

        isFloatingActionBtnVisible = true;
        Toast.makeText(getContext(), ""Animation Added"", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    } else {
        // Starting Animation
        addVideoFloatingBtn.startAnimation(toBottom);
        addNotesFloatingBtn.startAnimation(toBottom);
        addFloatingBtn.startAnimation(rotateClose);

        // Delay the visibility change until the animation finishes
        new Handler().postDelayed(() -> {
            // Making Buttons Invisible
            addVideoFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.GONE);
            addNotesFloatingBtn.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }, 200); // Adjust the delay time as needed

        isFloatingActionBtnVisible = false;
    }
});
```

By adding a delay before changing the visibility, you allow the animations to finish before the buttons become invisible. Adjust the delay time (currently set to 200 milliseconds) as needed to ensure the animations complete before the visibility changes.

With this modification, the other floating action buttons should become invisible after the animation finishes when the add button is clicked for the second time.",0.5043357610702515,"java, android",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73436929,Microtask as macrotask in javascript code,"I've found this note in whatwg spec:

It is possible for a microtask to be moved to a regular task queue, if, during its initial execution, it spins the event loop. This is the only case in which the source, document, and script evaluation environment settings object set of the microtask are consulted; they are ignored by the perform a microtask checkpoint algorithm.

What is an example of it, that expresses this quote? How is it possible to move a microtask from the microtask stack to the macrotask stack and perform it like a macrotask?
","This was here for showModalDialog, which used to load a document in a modal, blocking the initial document until this modal is closed... For this to happen the UA had to &quot;spin the event loop&quot; until the modal's document is closed. This &quot;spin the event loop&quot; macro does convert the microtask to a &quot;simple&quot; task.
The showModalDialog() method has been removed from the specs but this remained since it can also be used in other modals or to allow &quot;long tasks&quot; to be short circuited by the UA, so that they can update the rendering and e.g show a message to the user about the long script.
This is for instance advised in a note about pausing, called by all modals like alert(), prompt(), etc.:

Pausing is highly detrimental to the user experience, especially in scenarios where a single event loop is shared among multiple documents. User agents are encouraged to experiment with alternatives to pausing, such as spinning the event loop or even simply proceeding without any kind of suspended execution at all, insofar as it is possible to do so while preserving compatibility with existing content.

You also have that in some browsers with infinite loops, where they'll pause the script and show a message along the lines of &quot;A script on this page is taking too long, do you want to wait or kill it with fire?&quot;.
As an example, in Firefox, both cases will trigger a rendering update when the prompt is shown to the user, i.e they do spin the event loop. So if the &quot;pause&quot; was triggered from inside of a microtask, they should move it to a macrotask when it's resumed.
However IIRC, they actually use a custom version of spin the event loop that only allow for the rendering phase (without callbacks) and nothing more. And the microtask isn't really converted to a task even there.
There are active discussions, where it is planned to &quot;remove this concept&quot; of reentering microtasks, since it's actually not really used by implementers. And even if it was, I'm not sure that'd be observable to us.
","In JavaScript, the event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous operations. It consists of a microtask queue and a macrotask queue. Microtasks are executed before macrotasks in each iteration of the event loop.

According to the quote from the WHATWG spec, it is possible for a microtask to be moved to the macrotask queue if, during its initial execution, it spins the event loop. This means that if a microtask runs a long-running operation or a loop that doesn't yield control back to the event loop, it can cause the microtask to be moved to the macrotask queue.

Here's an example to illustrate this scenario:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Microtask');
  // Perform a long-running operation
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    // Do something that takes time
  }
});

console.log('End');
```

In this example, we have a microtask created using `Promise.resolve().then()`. Inside the microtask, there is a loop that performs a long-running operation. As a result, the microtask spins the event loop and doesn't allow other microtasks to be executed.

When this code is run, the output will be:

```
Start
End
```

The microtask is not executed immediately because it is blocked by the long-running operation. As a result, it is moved from the microtask queue to the macrotask queue and treated like a macrotask. Once the event loop finishes executing the current macrotask (in this case, the main script), it picks up the microtask from the macrotask queue and executes it.",0.5773632526397705,"javascript, event-loop",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73422387,Sphinx: how to change the function signature display format?,"I have a sphinx theme that renders function signatures using italics rather than code.
(my_function(arg1, arg2) rather than my_function(arg1, arg2))
I'd like to change that behavior, but I'm not sure how... Any ideas?

.. automodule:: my_module
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

The theme in question is sphinx_material https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/, maybe I should just switch themes, but it's pretty except for function signatures being italicized rather than rendered as code.
For an example function documentation, see here: https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/pymethod.html?highlight=send_message
","Thanks to Steve and some more searching, I was able to do this:
See here for how to add custom CSS: How to add custom css file to Sphinx?
In my case, what I needed in the custom.css file was
@import 'material_sphinx.css';

.sig.sig-object.py{
    font-feature-settings: &quot;kern&quot;;
    font-family: &quot;Roboto Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;
    background: #f8f8f8;
}

","To change the function signature display format in Sphinx, you can modify the Sphinx theme or override the CSS styles. Here's how you can achieve that:

1. Identify the CSS class or selector responsible for rendering the function signatures in italics. You can inspect the HTML elements using the browser's developer tools.

2. Once you have identified the CSS class or selector, you can override it by creating a custom CSS file. Create a new file, e.g., `custom.css`, in your Sphinx project's `_static` directory.

3. In the `custom.css` file, write the CSS code to change the display format of the function signatures. For example, to display the function signatures as code, you can use the `font-family` property to set a monospace font and remove any italic styles. Here's an example:

   ```css
   .my-function {
     font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
     font-style: normal;
   }
   ```

   Replace `.my-function` with the CSS class or selector you identified in step 1.

4. In your Sphinx project's `conf.py` file, add or modify the `html_static_path` configuration to include the `_static` directory:

   ```python
   html_static_path = ['_static']
   ```

5. Also in the `conf.py` file, add or modify the `html_css_files` configuration to include your custom CSS file:

   ```python
   html_css_files = ['custom.css']
   ```

6. Save the changes to the `conf.py` file and the `custom.css` file.

7. Rebuild your Sphinx documentation to apply the changes. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```
   sphinx-build -b html source build
   ```

   Note that you need to have Sphinx installed in your Python environment.

After rebuilding the documentation, the function signatures should be displayed according to the new format specified in your custom CSS file.

If you prefer, you can also switch to a different Sphinx theme that already displays function signatures as code. However, modifying the CSS styles as described above gives you more flexibility to customize the appearance of your documentation while still using the sphinx_material theme.",0.7134585380554199,"python, material-design, python-sphinx",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
73518721,Set item opacity in RecyclerView depending if item is in center,"I want to display items in a horizontal list using RecyclerView. At a time, only 3 items will be displayed. 1 in the middle and the other 2 on the side, below is an image of what I'm trying to achieve:

I'm using LinearSnapHelper which centers an item all of the time. When an item is moved away from the center I would like the opacity to progessively change from 1f to 0.5f.

                super.onScrolled(recyclerView, dx, dy)
                calculateVisibility()
            }
        })
    }

    private fun calculateVisibility() {
        val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
        val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
        val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
        var indexes: MutableList&lt;Int&gt; = mutableListOf()
        for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
            indexes.add(i)
            val item: View = layoutManager?.findViewByPosition(i) ?: continue
            item.getGlobalVisibleRect(itemBoundsRect)
            var itemSize = layoutManager!!.findViewByPosition(i)!!.width
            
            var visibleSize = 0
            if (indexes.size == 1) {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right
            } else {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right - itemBoundsRect!!.left
            }



            var visibilty = visibleSize * 100 / itemSize
            if (visibilty &gt; 0) {
                visibilty = 100 - visibilty
            }

            val viewHolder = findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
            viewHolder!!.itemView.alpha = (100 - visibilty).toFloat() / 100f
        }
    }
}

It doesn't work as expected as the opacity changes at the wrong time. The image below demonstrates this better. I expect the opacity to progressively begin to change when the item edges come out of the red box. However, it only starts when the item reaches the yellow edges.

Is there a way to achieve this effect?
Thank you :)
","Your code for calculateVisibility() is looking at global position when looking at the relative position within the RecyclerView is sufficient. Maybe there is more to the code than you posted, but try the following. This code looks at the x position of each visible view and calculates the alpha value as a function of displacement from the center of the RecyclerView. Comments are in the code.
private fun calculateVisibility(recycler: RecyclerView) {
    val midRecycler = recycler.width / 2
    val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = recycler.layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
    val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
    val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
    for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
        val viewHolder = recycler.findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
        viewHolder?.itemView?.apply {
            // This is the end of the view in the parent's coordinates
            val viewEnd = x + width
            // This is the maximum pixels the view can slide left or right until it disappears.
            val maxSlide = (midRecycler + width / 2).toFloat()
            // Alpha is determined by the percentage of the maximum slide the view has moved.
            // This assumes a linear fade but can be adjusted to fade in alternate ways.
            alpha = 1f - abs(maxSlide - viewEnd) / maxSlide
            Log.d(&quot;Applog&quot;, String.format(&quot;pos=%d alpha=%f&quot;, i, alpha))
        }
    }
}

The foregoing assumes that sizes remain constant.
","  Yes, you can achieve the desired effect by adjusting the `calculateVisibility()` method. Instead of calculating the visibility of each item only when it becomes visible or invisible, you can continuously calculate the visibility of each item while it's being scrolled. This way, you can smoothly animate the opacity of the items as they move in and out of the visible area.
Here's an updated version of the `calculateVisibility()` method that does this:
```kotlin
    private fun calculateVisibility() {
        val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
        val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
        val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
        var indexes: MutableList&lt;Int&gt; = mutableListOf()
        // Calculate the visibility of each item continuously as it's being scrolled
        for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
            indexes.add(i)
            val item: View = layoutManager?.findViewByPosition(i) ?: continue

            // Calculate the visibility of the item based on its position
            var itemSize = layoutManager!!.findViewByPosition(i)!!.width
            var visibleSize = 0
            if (indexes.size == 1) {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right
            } else {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right - itemBoundsRect!!.left
            }

            // Calculate the opacity of the item based on its visibility
            val visibilty = visibleSize * 100 / itemSize
            if (visibilty > 0) {
                visibilty = 100 - visibilty
            }
            val viewHolder = findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
            viewHolder!!.itemView.alpha = (100 - visibilty).toFloat() / 100f

            // Continuously update the visibility of the item as it's being scrolled
            linearLayoutManger.post(Runnable {
                calculateVisibility()
            })
        }
    }
```
In this updated version, we continuously calculate the visibility of each item by checking its position in the `calculateVisibility()` method and updating its opacity accordingly. We also post a `Runnable` to the `post()` method of the `LinearLayoutManager` to continuously call the `calculateVisibility()` method while the user is scrolling.
By doing this, you should be able to achieve the desired effect of gradually changing the opacity of the items as they move in and out of the visible area.",0.6431573629379272,"android, kotlin, android-recyclerview, android-animation",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

I usually want to sum a specific column by some grouping properties, and to do that I use:
res_sum=test_data %&gt;% group_by(sample, type) %&gt;% summarise_at( .vars = &quot;area&quot;, .funs = sum )

So far so good, the problem arrives when I want to put the results in a &quot;nice&quot; format.
The lines below put the result in the way I want, but I find this way cumbersome.
res_sum_a=res_sum[res_sum$type==&quot;a&quot;, ]
colnames(res_sum_a)[3]=paste0( colnames(res_sum)[3], &quot;.a&quot;)

res_sum_b=res_sum[res_sum$type==&quot;b&quot;, ]
colnames(res_sum_b)[3]=paste0( colnames(res_sum)[3], &quot;.b&quot;)

res_df=merge(res_sum_a[,c(1,3)], res_sum_b[, c(1,3)], by=&quot;sample&quot;, all=TRUE)

head(res_df)

  sample area.a area.b
1      A    244    147
2      B     17    152
3      C    153    541
4      D    107     94
5      E    246    266
6      F    189    286

Note, there may be more than 2 &quot;type&quot; in the original data frame (so, like a,b,c....).
Is there a way, that is more dplyr idiomatic to do this?
Thanks.
","What you're referring to is pivoting, which is provided by a separate package ({tidyr}).
I also updated your dplyr code to most recent syntax (e.g., summarise_at() has been repalced by across()).
library(dplyr)
#&gt; 
#&gt; Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#&gt; 
#&gt;     filter, lag
#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#&gt; 
#&gt;     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(tidyr)

set.seed(123)
test_data=data.frame(sample=sample(LETTERS[1:10], 100,replace = TRUE), type=sample(letters[1:2], 100, replace=TRUE ), area=sample(1:100, replace=TRUE) )

test_data |&gt; 
  group_by(sample, type) |&gt; 
  summarise(across(area, sum)) |&gt; 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = area)
#&gt; `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sample'. You can override using the
#&gt; `.groups` argument.
#&gt; # A tibble: 10 x 3
#&gt; # Groups:   sample [10]
#&gt;    sample     a     b

","  Yes, there is a more idiomatic way to perform the operation you described using `dplyr`. Here's an alternative solution:
First, you can use `group_by()` to group the data by `sample` and `type`, and then use `summarise()` to calculate the `area` column for each group.
`res_sum <- test_data %>% group_by(sample, type) %>% summarise_at(vars(area), funs(sum)))`
This will give you the same result as your line `res_sum=test_data %&gt;% group_by(sample, type) %&gt;% summarise_at( .vars = &quot;area&quot;, .funs = sum )`
After that, you can use `select()` to extract the columns of interest and `unique()` to remove any duplicated rows.
`res_df <- res_sum %>% select(sample, type, area.a, area.b) %>% unique()`
This will give you the final output with the `area` column grouped by `sample` and `type`, and with the `area.a` and `area.b` columns filled with the summarized values.
Note that in the `select()` line, I've used `area.a` and `area.b` as the column names, instead of the raw column names `area` and `area`, because in R, column names are case-sensitive.
Also, you can use `arrange()` to arrange the output in the way you want, by specifying the columns to be sorted by and the order in which they should be sorted.
`res_df <- res_sum %>% select(sample, type, area.a, area.b) %>% unique()->arrange(sample, type)`
This will give you the output in the order of `sample` and then `type`, with the `area` columns sorted in ascending order.

","  To disable an option based on a specific value in an array, you can use a simple JavaScript loop to iterate through the `Products` array and check the `stock` value of each object. If the `stock` value is less than 0 or 1, you can set the `disable` prop to `true` for that option. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to achieve this:
```javascript
const Products = [
    { key: 1, value: ""A"", stock: 0 },
    { key: 2, value: ""B"", stock: 1 },
    { key: 3, value: ""C"", stock: 2 },

    { key: 5, value: ""E"", stock: 0 },
    { key: 6, value: ""F"", stock: 3 },
    { key: 7, value: ""G"", stock: 4 },
];
function ProductPage() {
    const [product, setProduct] = useState(1); // initial value : 1

    const productChangeHandler = (event) => {
        setProduct(event.currentTarget.value);
    }

    const disableOptions = Products.filter((item) => item.stock < 0 || item.stock === 1);

    return (
        <div style={{ maxWidth: '700px', margin: '2rem auto' }}>
            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>

                <br />
                <select onChange={productChangeHandler} value={product} disabled={disableOptions.length > 0}>
                    {Products.map((item) => (
                        <option key={item.key} value={item.key} disabled={disableOptions.includes(item.key)}>
                            {item.value}
                        </option>
                    ))}

                {/* Add a blank option to disable selection in case no products are available */}
                <option value="""">– Select a product –</option>

            <Button>Upload</Button>


        </Form>

    </div>

)

export default ProductPage;

```
In this example, we've added a `disableOptions` array that contains the keys of the `Products` array items that have a `stock` value less than 0 or 1. We've then added a `disabled` prop to the select element that is set to `true` if the `disableOptions` array contains the value of the selected option.
Note that we've also added a blank option to the select element with a value of ""– Select a product –"". This is so that even if no products are available, the user can still select this option.

","You're getting that error because you are calling Intent's class constructor with a wrong argument. The first argument should be a Context and not a View. The keyword this is referring in your code to a View and not to a context, hence the error.
To solve this, you have to pass a Context object like this:
val i = Intent(view.getContext(), PackDetailActivity::class.java)

And your error will go away.
","  It looks like you are having trouble linking a click listener to a `CardView` in your Fragment to navigate to another activity. You are getting an error message that the `Intent` cannot be resolved.
To fix this, you will need to import the `Intent` class from the `android.os` package, like this:
`import android.os.Intent`
Then, you can create an `Intent` object and pass it the data you want to send to the new activity, like this:
`val intent = Intent(this, PackDetailActivity::class.java).apply {
        // Add extra data to the Intent
        putExtra(""key"", ""value"")
    }
startActivity(intent)`

In your current code, you are trying to use the `Intent` class from the `androidx.appcompat.app` package, which is not the correct package to import. You should use the `android.os` package instead.
Additionally, you will need to make sure that you have the `PackDetailActivity` class defined in your project, and that it is properly imported in your code.

I don't know where to start!
Any ideas?
","For your question, reason your app lost all photos everytime you refresh because it was temporary store but not save somewhere else ( internet or on local).
If you want to save it on you own server, create server side and do with api.
Come to local here, you have come to the right path finding a local which is Core Data to store. But the key point to need to know here is:

Saving image to local should use FileManager ( which means each app have the own documentary folder in your phone so save the not only image but document, files, everything else to here - It will lost only when your app is uninstalled) You just need to keep the name of the image ( you can create your own name to save image)

Code will be like this
func saveImage(imageName: String, image: UIImage) {
    // get documentary path to save image to
    guard let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first else { return }

    let fileName = imageName
    let fileURL = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent(fileName)
    guard let data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1) else { return }

    //Checks if file exists, removes it if so.
    if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: fileURL.path) {
        do {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(atPath: fileURL.path)
            print(&quot;Removed old image&quot;)
        } catch let removeError {
            print(&quot;couldn't remove file at path&quot;, removeError)
        }

    }
    
    do {
        try data.write(to: fileURL)
    } catch let error {
        print(&quot;error saving file with error&quot;, error)
    }
}

func loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String) -&gt; UIImage? {
  let documentDirectory = FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.documentDirectory

    let userDomainMask = FileManager.SearchPathDomainMask.userDomainMask
    let paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(documentDirectory, userDomainMask, true)

    if let dirPath = paths.first {
        let imageUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: dirPath).appendingPathComponent(fileName)
        let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: imageUrl.path)
        return image

    }

    return nil
}

Next is the Core Data or UserDefaults is where you save the key connect to the list of name images you save before. So everytime you come into app, just take the list image name out from the key and appear it again
I will do with UserDefaults you can try to implement the same with CoreData. I save image as name is number so I save to UserDefault only the number of images. You can change to something like you want
Code will be like this
var imageArray = [UIImage]()
var countImage = 0

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // get number of image have been saved
    let countImage = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: &quot;test&quot;)

    if countImage &lt; 1 {
        return
    }
    
    for i in 1...countImage {
        // get image from disk
        imageArray.append(self.loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String(i))!)
    }
    
    print(imageArray)
    self.collectionView.reloadData() // reload collection view
}

func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    let group = DispatchGroup()
    
    results.forEach { result in
        group.enter()
        result.itemProvider.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self) { reading, error in
            defer {
                group.leave()
            }
            guard let image = reading as? UIImage, error == nil else {
                return
            }
            // add to user's photo array
            print(image)
            self.imageArray.append(image)
            // append self.countImage to 1 and save number to  UserDefault and image to FileManager
            self.countImage += 1
            UserDefaults.standard.set(self.countImage, forKey: &quot;test&quot;)
            self.saveImage(imageName: String(self.countImage), image: image)
        }
    }
    
    group.notify(queue: .main) {
        self.collectionView.reloadData()
    }
}

","  It sounds like you are facing a common issue in iOS development where data persistence is not being maintained after relaunching the app. Here are some possible solutions that you can try:

1. **Core Data saved separately:** Core Data has a built-in mechanism for persisting data across app relaunches, which is achieved by saving the Core Data stack separately from the app's bundle. This can be done by setting the `NSPersistsStorePreferences` attribute to `true` on the app's Info.plist file and implementing the `encode(with:)` method to save the Core Data stack to a file.
2. **Async storage:** Use a third-party library like AWS or Firebase to store the uploaded images asynchronously. This way, the images will be stored in a remote server and can be accessed even after the app is relaunched.
3. **Local storage:** Use a local storage solution like Realm or SQLite to store the uploaded images. This way, the images will be stored locally on the user's device and can be accessed even after app relaunches.
4. **Core Data cache:** Use Cache Core Data framework to cache the uploaded images. This way, the images will be stored in the app's cache and can be accessed even after app relaunches.





Here is how you can implement the above solutions in your code:
1. **Core Data saved separately:**

 var managedObjectModel = NSManagedObjectModel(information: nil)
        let persistentStore Cooper = NSPersistentStoreCoordinator(managedObjectModel: managedObjectModel)
        let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: ""imageData"", ofType: ""moodat"")
        if let url = path as? URL {
            Cooper.addPersistentStore(with: url, options: [NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption: true], error: nil)
        }
        // ...

2. **Async storage:**

 let storage = AWSArtifacts()
 let upload = storage.uploadImage(imageArray) { [weak self] response in
                // ...
                // If the image is uploaded successfully, add it to your CollectionView
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self?.collectionView.reloadData()
                }

3. **Local storage:**

let fileManager = FileManager.default
let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!
let imageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(imageArray[0])
let imageDataPath = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent(""imageData.plist"")
do {
try fileManager.createDirectory(at: documentsDirectory, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)

try imageData.write(to: imageDataPath)

}


4. **Core Data cache:**


func cacheImage(image: UIImage) {

    let data = UIImagePNGRepresentation(image)

    let cachePath = ""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/ frameworks/ImageCache.framework/imageCache""

    do {

    let cacheFile = try Data(contentsOf: cachePath)

    // ...

    let encodedData = try compressData(data, compressor: compression)

    // ...

    // Save the image to the cache
    do {
        try encodedData.write(to: cachePath, options: [.atomic])
    } catch {

    }
}











In summary, there are several solutions to the problem of persisting data after relaunching an iOS app. The best solution depends on your app's specific requirements and constraints. By implementing one of the above solutions, you should be able to fix the issue and successfully persist your app's data after relaunching.",0.7443759441375732,"swift, xcode, swiftui, core-data, uiimage",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

the demo on the site http://jolt-demo.appspot.com/ is

","  Based on your provided Jolt specification and the issue you're trying to resolve, here's an approach to filter out files with a size greater than 0:
1. First, remove the `content` object from the Jolt specification, as you don't need it.

{
  &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;shift&quot;,
  &quot;spec&quot;: {
    &quot;files&quot;: {
      &quot;*&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: {
          &quot;file&quot;: {
            &quot;@2&quot;: &quot;files[]&quot;,
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

2. Next, add a filter to the `files` array to only include objects with a `length` property greater than 0. You can use the `>` operator to compare the `length` property to 0.

{
  &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;shift&quot;,
  &quot;spec&quot;: {
    &quot;files&quot;: {
      &quot;*&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: {
          &quot;file&quot;: {
            &quot;@2&quot;: &quot;files[]&quot;,
          },
        }
      },
      &quot;filter&quot;: {
        &quot;length&quot;: {
          &quot;&gt;0&quot;,
        }
      }
    }

The filtered result should be:
{
  &quot;files&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;filename&quot;: &quot;part-00043-f56d8bfa-2a3d-438c-89a5-d9a2460e6c66-c000.json&quot;,
      &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;/user/testuser/test_project/processing/data&quot;,
      &quot;filesize&quot;: &quot;782&quot;,
      &quot;@2&quot;: &quot;files[]&quot;
    }
  ]
}

Note that the `filter` object inside the `files` array is a JSON object with a single property, `length`, which is a JSON array containing a single element, `>0`. This will filter out any objects with a `length` property of 0.",0.680081844329834,"json, specifications, jolt",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

        ""*"": {
          ""type"": {

In the modified Jolt spec, a new operation called ""filter"" is added. This operation checks the ""filesize"" field of each file and removes the file from the output if its value is ""0"". The ""#remove"" directive is used to remove the file from the result.

After applying this modified Jolt spec to your input JSON, the resulting output will only contain files with a size greater than 0:

```json
{
  ""files"": [
    {
      ""filename"": ""part-00043-f56d8bfa-2a3d-438c-89a5-d9a2460e6c66-c000.json"",
      ""filepath"": ""/user/testuser/test_project/processing/data"",
      ""filesize"": ""782""
    }
  ]
}
```

This output includes only the file with a size of 782, and the file with a size of 0 is filtered out.",0.6370371580123901,"json, specifications, jolt",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

","Stripe's API reference doc shows how to get subscription list and filter by status.
Stripe won't return 'canceled' subscriptions unless you specify 'status' =&gt; 'canceled' or 'status' =&gt; 'all' in the request. If status is omitted from the request, the response will only include non-canceled subscriptions.
You also need to pass a value for the customer parameter if you want to list a specific customer's subscription(s) only.
In short, you need to pass status and customer query parameters in your request to receive all subscriptions of specific customer.
","  It seems that the problem is with the `status` property of the subscription object in the `subscriptions-all()` response. The `status` property is only updated when the subscription is successfully charged or cancelled. If the subscription is in a state other than ""active"" or ""inprogress"", the `status` property will be `null`.
Here are a few things you can try to troubleshoot the issue:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Stripe API PHP library installed. You can check this by running `php -v` in your terminal. If you're using an older version, update to the latest version.
2. Check the status of the subscription using the `retrieve` method instead of `all`. The `retrieve` method will return the latest status of a subscription, whereas `all` will return all the subscriptions for a customer. Here's an example:
```php
$subscription = $stripe->subscriptions->retrieve($custid1);
$status = $subscription->status;
```
3. If you're sure that the subscription is in a valid state, try using the `latest` method to retrieve the latest status. The `latest` method will return the latest status of a subscription, even if the status is not fully updated. Here's an example:
```php

$subscription = $stripe->subscriptions->latest($custid1);

$status = $subscription->status;

```
4. Make sure you have the correct customer ID. Double-check that the `customer` parameter in the `subscriptions-all()` method has the correct ID for the customer you're trying to retrieve the status for.
5. Check the Stripe Logs for any error messages. You can find the Stripe Logs in the Stripe Dashboard under ""Logs"". Look for any errors related to the subscription or the API request.
If none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about the customer, the subscription, and the error message you're encountering.",0.8078498840332031,stripe-payments,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","  Great, I understand the problem you're facing! To solve it, you can use WP_Query to fetch the posts for the previous week and exclude the current week's posts. Here's the modified code for the $footer_post_type array:
```php
            $footer_post_type = array(
            'posts_per_page' => 4,

				array(
					'after_or_equal' => strftime('%U - 7 days'), // Exclude current week's posts
				),
			),
		), // Exclude current week's posts using WP_Query



```
In this code, we added a new `post_type` arg to the `array()` function and set it to 'post'. This will exclude the current posts from being fetched. Then, we added a `date_query` arg to the WP_Query object, which specifies the date range for fetching posts.
The `after_or_equal` parameter is set to `strftime('%U - 7 days')`, which excludes the current week's posts. The `strftime()` function formats the date in the format `xx xxx`, where `xx` is the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.) and `xxx` is the date. In this case, we're setting the date to the previous week's date minus 7 days.
So, the query will fetch the posts from the previous week (i.e., the week that ends 7 days before the current week).
Note that you may need to adjust the date format depending on your WordPress installation's date format setting.

    'orderby' => 'rand',
    'post_type' => array(
        'post'
    ),
);
```

In this modified code, the `week` parameter is set to the previous week using the `strtotime()` function with the `'-1 week'` argument. This ensures that only posts from the previous week will be fetched.

By subtracting 1 week from the current week, you'll get the desired result of excluding the current week's posts and showing only the posts from the week before.

In the hostPath example, all files inside /mnt/data will be mounted as /usr/share/nginx/html in the Pod.
","  Yes, you can mount directly the main directories of containers to volumes as part of a Kubernetes pod spec. To do this, you can use the `volumeMounts` field in the `containers` section of the pod spec, which allows you to mount a volume to a directory inside a container.
Here is an example of how you can mount the main directories of containers to volumes in a Kubernetes pod spec:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: mnt

  - name: dev
    hostPath:
      path: /dev
  - name: var
    hostPath:
      path: /var

```
In this example, the `volumeMounts` field is used to mount the main directories of the container to volumes. The `name` field specifies the name of the volume mount, and the `mountPath` field specifies the directory inside the container where the volume should be mounted.
The `volumes` field is used to specify the volumes that should be attached to the container. In this case, three volumes are specified: `mnt`, `dev`, and `var`. The `persistentVolumeClaim` field is used to specify a persistent volume claim (PVC) that provides the volume for the `mnt` volume mount.
You can also use the `hostPath` field to mount a directory on the host machine as a volume. In this case, the `path` field specifies the directory on the host machine that should be mounted as a volume.
By using the `volumeMounts` field in the `containers` section of the pod spec, you can easily mount the main directories of containers to volumes.

","In Kubernetes, you can mount directories like /mnt, /dev, and /var to volumes as part of the podspec. However, it is generally not recommended to mount the entire directories directly to volumes, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

Instead, it is best practice to identify specific subdirectories within these main directories that you want to mount as volumes. This allows for better control and isolation of the data that needs to be accessed or modified by the containers in the pod.

To achieve this, you can use the ""volumeMounts"" field in the podspec's container definition. Here's an example of how you can mount specific subdirectories to volumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mnt-volume
          mountPath: /mnt/my-subdirectory
        - name: dev-volume
          mountPath: /dev/my-subdirectory
        - name: var-volume
          mountPath: /var/my-subdirectory
  volumes:
    - name: mnt-volume
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: dev-volume
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: var-volume
      emptyDir: {}
```

In this example, we create three emptyDir volumes (`mnt-volume`, `dev-volume`, `var-volume`) and mount specific subdirectories (`/mnt/my-subdirectory`, `/dev/my-subdirectory`, `/var/my-subdirectory`) from the main directories (`/mnt`, `/dev`, `/var`) to these volumes.

Please note that you can also use other volume types like hostPath, persistentVolumeClaim, or cloud-specific volume types based on your requirements.

By following this approach, you can mount specific subdirectories of the main directories to volumes in a controlled manner, ensuring better security and flexibility in managing data within your Kubernetes pods.",0.6358574628829956,"kubernetes, kubernetes-pod",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

In this example, we're using the `html2pdf` function from jspdf to convert the HTML content of a ` ionic-view` element into a PDF document. However, we're passing an empty string as the `page` parameter, which tells jspdf to render the PDF document without displaying any HTML content.

```

```


```
This time, we're using the `html2pdf` function to generate the PDF document from the `ionViewContent` property of the `ionic-view` element, which contains the HTML content of the view. We're also passing the `empty` option as the second argument, which tells jspdf to render the PDF document without displaying any HTML content.

```

```


```
Now, let's take a look at how you can customize the PDF document further by adding a title, header, and footer. To do this, you can use the `addPage` method of the `pdf` object, which allows you to add content to a specific page of the PDF document. Here's an example of how you can add a title, header, and footer to your PDF document:

73017844,HTML to PDF using jspdf in ionic,"I want to convert html to pdf using jspdf but i want to generate the pdf without showing the html content to users. The technology im using is ionic.
Please help on this issue
","  public downloadPDF() {
    const doc = new jsPDF();

    const specialElementHandlers = {
      '#editor': function (element, renderer) {
        return true;
      }
    };

    const content = this.content.nativeElement;

      width: 190,
      'elementHandlers': specialElementHandlers
    });

    doc.save('test.pdf');
  }

Example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-html-to-pdf-example
","To convert HTML to PDF using jspdf in Ionic without displaying the HTML content to users, you can follow these steps:

1. Install jspdf and html2canvas libraries in your Ionic project:
   ```
   npm install jspdf --save
   npm install html2canvas --save
   ```

2. Import the required libraries in your component file:
   ```typescript
   import * as jsPDF from 'jspdf';
   import * as html2canvas from 'html2canvas';
   ```

3. Create a function that will handle the conversion process:
   ```typescript
   export class YourComponent {
     convertToPdf() {
       const pdf = new jsPDF('p', 'mm', 'a4');

       const options = {
         backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
         scale: 2
       };

       const content = document.getElementById('content');

       html2canvas(content, options).then(canvas => {
         const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
         const imgWidth = 210;
         const pageHeight = 295;
         const imgHeight = (canvas.height * imgWidth) / canvas.width;
         let heightLeft = imgHeight;

         let position = 0;

         pdf.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, position, imgWidth, imgHeight);
         heightLeft -= pageHeight;

         while (heightLeft >= 0) {
           position = heightLeft - imgHeight;
           pdf.addPage();
           pdf.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, position, imgWidth, imgHeight);
           heightLeft -= pageHeight;
         }

         pdf.save('converted.pdf');
       });
     }
   }
   ```

4. In your HTML template, add a button or any trigger to call the `convertToPdf()` function:
   ```html
   <button (click)=""convertToPdf()"">Convert to PDF</button>
   ```

5. Make sure you have an element with the id ""content"" in your HTML template that wraps the content you want to convert to PDF:
   ```html
   <div id=""content"">
     <!-- Your HTML content here -->
   </div>
   ```

6. When the button is clicked, the function `convertToPdf()` will be called. It uses html2canvas library to capture the content of the ""content"" element as an image, then adds the image to the PDF using jspdf. Finally, the PDF file is saved with the name ""converted.pdf"".

Now, when the user clicks the ""Convert to PDF"" button, the PDF file will be generated without displaying the HTML content to the user.",0.631405770778656,"angular, ionic-framework, mobile-development",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
72863142,Git fetch does not fetch the latest commits from the remote,"I have a two-machine (Mac and Win) setup where I need to transfer changes from the Windows machine to the Mac. So I make my changes on the Win machine, commit and push them to GitHub. So far, so good. (I have confirmed that the new commits are indeed on GitHub.)
But I have recently started having a problem on the Mac that git fetch origin does not fetch the new commits from GitHub. Therefore git pull (with the branch in question checked out) tells me it is already up to date.
This repository is a submodule. I looked at the config files for the submodule on both machines, which have identical settings for remotes and for the branch. They look as follows (with account and branch names changed to generic ones).
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:upstream/myrepo.git

[branch &quot;mybranch-name&quot;]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/mybranch-name

My question is, does anyone know why git fetch origin from the Mac is ignoring the new commits in the remote repository? Is there a way to force it to fetch from the actual remote repository on GitHub? (Since clearly this is not currently happening.)
Currently I have partial write access to the upstream remote, which allows me to work around this problem by pushing my branch there, then pulling it into the local branch on the Mac (then pushing to origin from the Mac). But I will soon be losing write access to upstream.
If it matters, I normally use SourceTree to manage git, but in this case I have been  doing the git commands directly from the command line with no difference in behavior. I have several other submodules that are not having this problem, nor is the main repository.
","The separate url and pushurl here are suspicious:

    url = git@github.com:upstream/myrepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    pushurl = git@github.com:personal/myrepo.git


As the git remote documentation says:

Note that the push URL and the fetch URL, even though they can be set differently, must still refer to the same place. What you pushed to the push URL should be what you would see if you immediately fetched from the fetch URL. If you are trying to fetch from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another (e.g. your publishing repository), use two separate remotes.

This caveat is, unfortunately, apparently only found in the git remote documentation; it probably should be in git fetch, git push, and git config documentation as well.
(As you've confirmed in the comments, this seems to be the basic problem, and apparently SourceTree did this for some reason known only to SourceTree.)
","  Thank you for providing the details of the issue you're facing. Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the `git fetch origin` command on the Mac is not fetching the latest commits from the remote repository on GitHub. Here are some potential reasons and solutions to investigate:
1. Authentication issues: Make sure that your account is properly authenticated on both machines. Check that the `GIT_ASSEMBLAuthenticator` environment variable is set correctly on both machines. You can also try running `git fetch origin --set-upstream` to update the upstream tracking information and fetch the latest commits.
2. Firewall or network issues: Make sure that the network connection between the two machines is stable and that there are no firewall issues blocking the connection. You can try running `git fetch origin --no-tags` to bypass any firewall issues and fetch only the commit hashes.
3. Remote repository configuration: Double-check the remote repository configuration on both machines. Make sure that the remote URL, fetch URL, and push URL are correct and match the remote repository on GitHub.
4. Submodule issues: As you mentioned, your repository is a submodule. Make sure that the submodule is properly configured and that the `git submodule update --init --recache` command has been run on both machines. This command will update the submodule tracking information and fetch the latest commits from the remote repository.
5. Global Git configuration: Check the global Git configuration on both machines to ensure that the `fetch` and `push` settings are correct. You can check this by running `git config --global fetch` and `git config --global push` on both machines to see if the settings are the same.
6. Local repository history: It's possible that the local repository on the Mac has a different history than the remote repository on GitHub. You can try running `gitk --all` on both machines to visualize the commit history and see if there are any differences.
7. Submodule branch conflict: If the submodule has a different branch set as the remote branch, it can cause issues with the `git fetch` command. Make sure that the submodule branch is set correctly on both machines, and that the `git fetch origin` command is running with the correct branch name.
8. Network latency or synchronization issues: If the machines are located in different time zones or have different network speeds, it can cause delays or synchronization issues with the Git fetch command. You can try running `git fetch origin --nowait` to bypass any network latency issues and fetch the latest commits immediately.
9. GitHub repository settings: Check the GitHub repository settings to ensure that the repository is set to allow pushes from outside collaborators. You can check this by going to the GitHub repository settings and checking the ""Allow pushes from outside collaborators"" setting.
If none of the above solutions work, you can try running `git fetch --prune origin` on the Mac to fetch the latest commits and prune any missing commits from the local repository. This command can help identify any issues with the remote repository and the local repository.
In summary, there could be several reasons why the `git fetch origin` command is ignoring the new commits in the remote repository on GitHub. By following the above steps, you can narrow down the issue and find a solution to fetch the latest commits correctly.",0.6426959037780762,"git, github",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama

","Based on the information provided, it seems like the issue lies with the configuration of your submodule on the Mac machine. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem:

1. Check remote URL: Double-check that the remote URL of the submodule on the Mac machine is correctly set to the GitHub repository. Run the following command to view the remote URLs:

   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

   Ensure that the URL shown for the `origin` remote points to the correct repository.

2. Update remote references: If the remote URL is correct, it's possible that your local repository is not aware of the latest remote references. To update the remote references, run the following command:

   ```
   git remote update
   ```

   This command will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and update the local references.

3. Verify branch tracking: Double-check that the branch on the Mac machine is correctly tracking the remote branch. Run the following command to view the branch configuration:

   ```
   git branch -vv
   ```

   Ensure that the branch `mybranch-name` has the correct remote and merge settings, pointing to `origin` and `refs/heads/mybranch-name`, respectively.

4. Force fetch: If the previous steps didn't resolve the issue, you can try forcing a fetch from the remote repository. Run the following command:

   ```
   git fetch --all
   ```

   This command will fetch all branches from all remotes, including the `origin` remote.

5. Reset local branch: If none of the above steps work, you can try resetting the local branch to the state of the remote branch. Warning: This will discard any local commits that have not been pushed to the remote repository. Run the following command:

   ```
   git checkout mybranch-name
   git reset --hard origin/mybranch-name
   ```

   This will switch to the `mybranch-name` branch and reset it to the latest commit of the remote branch.

After following these steps, you should be able to fetch the latest commits from the remote repository on the Mac machine. If the issue persists, it might be worth considering other factors like network connectivity or any specific firewall or proxy settings that could be interfering with the fetch operation.",0.5350182056427002,"git, github",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
