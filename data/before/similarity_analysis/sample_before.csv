73827986,Copy data from host to container efficiently,"The idea is a docker container which aims to train machine learning models for computer vision.
The data which is trained needs to be uploaded to the container, consumed and deleted afterwards.
Is there any way to use a volume and transport data efficiently between the host and the container?
When I searched on the web, most sources mentioned manual transport via bash or something similar, while my application needs to do this in an automated an repeating way for different datasets.
The host machine is a windows and the container is linux.
EDIT: there is a main application running on the machine which is responsible for managing the process.

send data to container (somehow?)
trigger training process

the training process runs async to not block the rest api
Any ideas?
","docker, containers",2,73829547,"You can use bind mounts when building you docker container,
See https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/
you specify a directory inside your container which will be mounted on a local directory on your host, this way all container write operations are mounted directly to your host directory.
I'd recommand doint it using docker-compose, for example below:
container directory /opt/Projects/01_MyProject will be mounted to host directory /Volumes/Partition_2/Docker-Volumes/Volume_1,
#docker-compose.yml
...
    volumes:

",rust,1,73368502,"The move is not within ne(), and thus borrowing it there will not solve the problem (also, to borrow it you need to do (&amp;mut name).ne(&quot;exit&quot;); &amp;mut name.ne(&quot;exit&quot;) will borrow the result of ne() mutably). ne() borrows the value with a shared reference.
The move, as the compiler tells you, is within vec.push(name). Here we move name, and any further attempt to access it is an error. But in the next round of the loop we'll try to do exactly that to compare it with &quot;exit&quot;!
There are generally two solutions to that:

Clone the string and push the cloned string to the vector, leaving the original unmodified.

vec.push(name.clone());


Instead of checking name directly, check the last value in the vector. We need to be careful to not assume there is such value, because the vector is empty in the beginning of the first iteration:

let mut vec = Vec::&lt;String&gt;::new();

while vec.last().map(|v| &amp;**v) != Some(&quot;exit&quot;) {
    let mut name = String::new();

    print!(&quot;Enter a name&quot;);
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut name)
        .expect(&quot;failed to readline&quot;);

    print!(&quot;You entered {}&quot;, name);

    vec.push(name);
    println!(&quot;length of vector is {}&quot;, vec.len());

    for i in &amp;vec {
        println!(&quot;name in vector is {}&quot;, i);
    }
}

But in your case, it is more likely that you don't want to push &quot;exit&quot; into the Vec at all. So, it is better to use loop with break:
let mut vec = Vec::&lt;String&gt;::new();
loop {
    let mut name = String::new();
    print!(&quot;Enter a name&quot;);
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut name)
        .expect(&quot;failed to readline&quot;);

    if name == &quot;exit&quot; {
        break;
    }

    print!(&quot;You entered {}&quot;, name);

    vec.push(name);
    println!(&quot;length of vector is {}&quot;, vec.len());

    for i in &amp;vec {
        println!(&quot;name in vector is {}&quot;, i);

72986123,how to detect a key press when a mouse click happened in tkinter canvas,"I have a canvas with a rectangle and I want to detect if someone pressed the rectangle together with a key (ie &quot;shift&quot;).

but it doesn't detect key events, only the mouseclick events work.
","python, tkinter, tkinter-canvas",0,72986284,"Instead of detecting whether the shift key is pressed or not, you can bind to the &lt;Shift-Button-1&gt; event so that the callback is only called if the user shift-clicks on the object.
Here is an example that will display the color of an item when you shift-click on it.
import tkinter as tk

def handle_click(event):
    color = event.widget.itemcget(&quot;current&quot;, &quot;fill&quot;)

If you want to handle multiple combinations of modifier keys (alt, shift, control, meta, etc) you can bind to &lt;1&gt; and examine the state attribute of the event object. However, there are platform dependencies that make that problematic. I personally find making individual bindings easier and more straight-forward.

The best way to make it bold is to make the format-indicator bold in the document itself.
The other way is to create a new XWPFRun and set it to bold. The text should be the value of the key. After that, you can just add all the fixed XWPFRuns into an ArrayList and re-insert them, after removing every run in the selected paragraph. You can then just remove the old-normal XWPFRun that contains the format-indicator.

What I have done so far
By checking whether each cell in the owner column have a &quot;,&quot; or not (implying this is a list), if it contains &quot;,&quot;, I convert it into an array and duplicate the row to the amount of length of the array minus 1 and later modify each row of that column into the order of and array. (Please see the code).

  var ws = SpreadsheetApp.openById(&quot;SHEET ID&quot;);

  var r = ss.getRange(&quot;A1:E20000&quot;);
  r.activate;
  var v = r.getValues();
  for (var i=1;i&lt;=20000;i++){
    if(v[i-1][3].includes(&quot;,&quot;)){ 
      var temp = v[i-1][3].split(&quot;, &quot;);
      ss.insertRows(i,temp.length-1);
      for (var j = 0; j&lt;temp.length; j++ ){
        ss.getRange(i+temp.length-1,1,1,5).copyTo(ss.getRange(i+j,1,1,5));

        }
    r.activate;
    v = r.getValues();

      }

What being problematic
The loop stopped right after when they fix the first case of the issue. For instance, based on the mock table, the first case is on the row 2. After fixing the row 2, the later case after row 2 are not affected by the code anymore.

Live Timer in React App
Sorry, my first post here. So, I'm not allowed to show image directly hence image is added as link.
Questions:
1, I'm not allowed to access Tos window object directly. Hence I accessed it like &quot;window.Tos&quot; in React root index.html  Is it the right approach to fetch third party object in React?
2, Is it proper way to include the HTML block,
&lt;span id=&quot;timeonsite&quot; style=&quot;color:#f55;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt; Seconds

or the right way would be write it as React component?
3, I added the powerful
setInterval(function() {}, 1000);

JS Interval function. Is it fine or we can use React inbuilt timer function for updating TIMER &quot;div&quot; each second?
FYI, I will need this Tos JS object in every page in my React web app so that I show how much time the user spent in the app so far in web page. If it can be written as React component, could you show a sample component written for this live time-counter. I've seen one other question in SO raising the same question but that used JS date timer directly instead of full-fledged tracker like timeonsite.js. Thanks for your help.
","javascript, reactjs, time-tracking",0,74086439,"Let's try to give you some answers:

I'm not allowed to access Tos window object directly. Hence I accessed
it like &quot;window.Tos&quot; in React root index.html Is it the right approach
to fetch third party object in React?

As long as you declare Tos as a global variable you should be able to access it from all the scopes. But more importantly there are several ways of achieving what you want.
To add a third-party object in React you can:

add it as you did in the index.html file, the approach you took. The issue here is that then to have some communication between the third party library and your react code it can only happen through global variables which could be a bad pattern.
Using some kind of webpack plugin for your cdn. But this will present the same issue as the previous approach. It just looks cleaner.
Add onMount the script:

function App() {
  // Proof that we can use Tos object
  const click = () =&gt; {
    console.log('Click', Tos)
    Tos
  }
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // This is the same that your script does but in a &quot;React&quot; way
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
    script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
    script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {

        const config = {
          trackBy: 'seconds',
          developerMode: true,
          callback: function(data) {
            console.log(data);

          }
        };
        if(TimeOnSiteTracker) {
         // IF this was not a `var` it will not be a global scoped variable
          var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
          window.Tos = Tos;
        }

    })
    document.body.appendChild(script)
  }, [])
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={click}&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

Using useEffect we can basically mount the 3rd-party library on the mount lifecycle. In this last approach, you have more control over the parameters that you pass to the library, they can even be more dynamic and easier to interact as you will see in the answer to your 3rd question.

Is it proper way to include the HTML block,
or the right way would be write it as React component?

To get the power of react (rendering, performance control over components) the best thing will be to move this code into the JSX of your app. This way this element will be dynamically added and not hard coded as in your approach.

I added the powerful setInterval(function() {}, 1000); JS Interval function. Is it fine or
we can use React inbuilt timer function for updating TIMER &quot;div&quot; each
second?

Actually given the API of Timeonsite.js, there is no better way of doing this (some may think that callback argument is called every time there is an update, but no, only on start and onload. Also, if we check what the developermode does, it basically calls Tos every second using the interval:
if (this.developerMode) {
        setInterval(function() {
            self.showProgress();
        }, (1 * 1000));
    }

To do this in a React friendly way:
 const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
        console.log(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
    }, 1000);
    return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

And then in the JSX:
 &lt;div&gt;You spent: &lt;span&gt; { timer }&lt;/span&gt; seconds&lt;/div&gt;

So if you declare it in your root component like this:
import './App.css';
import { useEffect, useState} from &quot;react&quot;;


function App() {
    const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0)

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
            setTimer(window.Tos.getTimeOnPage().timeOnPage)
        }, 1000);
        return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
    }, []);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const script = document.createElement('script')
        script.setAttribute('src', '//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/saleemkce/timeonsite@1.2.1/timeonsitetracker.min.js')
        script.id = 'TimeOnSiteTracker'
        script.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {
            const config = {
                trackBy: 'seconds',
            };

            if (TimeOnSiteTracker) {
                var Tos = new TimeOnSiteTracker(config);
                window.Tos = Tos;
            }

        })
        document.body.appendChild(script)
    }, [])
    
    return (
        &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
            &lt;header className=&quot;App-header&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    You spent : &lt;span&gt;{timer} &lt;/span&gt; Seconds
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}


You can get a timer. Then it is a matter of playing in how you access the state in all your pages and properly configuring Tos to be tracked in all the pages you want.

73891997,Share User Table between different websites for authorisation,"New to Backendless but have done a considerable amount of their lessons to get a good understanding. Having searched the forums I haven't quite got the info I need.

If I have one App/account in Backendless, does this mean I only ever have one 'Users' Table?

For the sake of economy and thus not having to buy multiple Apps/Accounts on Backendless is there anyway to create additional 'User' tables for other websites I would like to connect to for user authorisation?

If, no, is there a way to do this? For example is there a way to add a new Column to Backendless 'Users' to somehow categorise the 'Users' by website/app? So I could user the User Authorisation from both Site A and Site B?


Thanks in advance for any advice in relation to this.

PS I only use Backendless for the Backend and hope to connect in from both Bubble and Webflow (depending on the project).
",backendless,0,73894508,"
Yes, you can have only one Users table in the application

You can create other tables, but you will not be able to use Backendless User API with the other tables

Sure, you can add a column like project and it can be a relation to the  Project table or something like that.


I do not recommend doing this, because such an economy may cause to the issues in the future.
Looks like you are trying to do a backendless inside the backendless.

73979650,How to lookup data across different sheets by given id and aggregate the results into single cell in O365 Excel?,"I have a spreadsheet with multiple sheets that each contain data I need to lookup and aggregate.
The current data structure and formats are as following:
SheetA (Master Sheet):




Id
(misc)
Components
...other non relevant columns




And the secondary sheets (SheetB, SheetC..., let's represent them as SheetX) with the same format:




RefId
Id
Component
...other non relevant columns




Where RefId represents a value of Id column from the master sheet.
The goal is to populate the Components column from the master sheet (SheetA) with the information from secondary sheets (SheetX). Considering the following rules:

The content of Components for a given Id value will the be the value of Component from any secondary sheet, where RefId column value is the same. If there is more than value, then it concatenates all the component information delimited by comma (,).
If the Components value in the master sheet is not empty, then the content of the search by Id will be appended delimited by comma (,).
The sheet names can be provided as a list or just refer in the formula to each sheet name.

Lets say if we have the following input information:
Master Sheet A:




Id
(misc)
Components
...other non relevant columns




A1

xxxx



A2





A3







Sheet B:




RefId
Id
Component
...other non relevant columns




A1
B1
B1Comp



A2
B1
B2Comp



A3
B3
B3Comp





and
Sheet C:




RefId
Id
Component
...other non relevant columns




A2
C1
C1Comp



A2
C2
C2Comp





The expected result will be in the Consolidated Sheet:




Id
(misc)
Components
...other non relevant columns




A1

xxxx,B1Comp



A2

B2Comp,C1Comp,C2Comp



A3

B3Comp





Note: Please don't consider any string pattern, they are just some string representation.
Currently I'm using the above mentioned VLOOKUP formulas, but they break when a sheet has multiple entries for a given Id.
","excel, excel-365",0,73994924,"Let's try with Power Query(PQ), your question is related to typical ETL operations and PQ is more suitable than using excel functions.
To easy differentiate the sheets, I am going to consider the Master Sheet, where we want the information consolidated and the secondary sheets, which are the input sheets to consolidate the information in the Master.
Since all the secondary sheets (SheetA, SheetB...) have the same structure, we can merge them.
This is the PQ command to generate AllSheets query as output:
=Table.Combine({TB_ShA, TB_ShB, TB_ShC})

When a connection is created from a range, PQ creates an Excel Table. I named them as: TB_ShA,...TB_ShC, for each corresponding sheet. On each table I have the following data for testing purpose (secondary sheets plus the Master Table). The Master table at the end will be updated with the consolidated components.
You can add as many sheets as you need in the previous formula to consolidate the component information. The rest of the process described here remains the same.

Now lets explain the main steps in PQ:
Load the Master table (TB_Master):

Next rename the Components column from the master table to Master Component:
= Table.RenameColumns(Source,{{&quot;Components&quot;, &quot;Master Component&quot;}})

Next we do a merge queries (Home-&gt; Merge Queries), with the Master table and AllSheets (all secondary tables), linking Id and RefId from each tables.
= Table.NestedJoin(#&quot;Renamed MasterComponent&quot;, {&quot;Id&quot;}, AllSheets, 
 {&quot;RefId&quot;}, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter)


and expand the Table information (just click on the top right icon of the table), here is the corresponding command:
= Table.ExpandTableColumn(#&quot;Merged Queries&quot;, &quot;AllSheets&quot;, 
  {&quot;Component&quot;}, {&quot;AllSheets.Component&quot;})


We need to change the type of Master Component column to text because later we are going to do some text operations and it is required:
= Table.TransformColumnTypes(#&quot;Expanded AllSheets&quot;,
  {{&quot;Master Component&quot;, type text}})

Now if we try to concatenate Master Component column with AllSheets.Component column, it works BUT, we are going to have duplication of Master Component values when we merge the information by unique values of the ID column. For example as it is now, if we merge the first two rows that belong to M1we will get the following:
xxxx,A1Comp,xxxx,BiComp

so we need to remove the repetition of Master Component column. In order to do that I used the solution from @RonRosenfeld from this question: Replace second or more instances of duplicates with null.
It requires two steps: dupsNull and add de-duped. The first one creates a temporary list with duplicated replaced with null, The second just adds the list created as a new column:

Note: I am assuming the pre-populated Components values from the input Master Sheet are unique, if that is not the case, it needs to be adjusted to avoid repetition only per Id value from this sheet.
Next we remove unnecessary columns:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and now  we are ready to concatenate both columns:
= Table.AddColumn(#&quot;Removed Columns&quot;, &quot;Components&quot;, 
  each Text.Combine({[Master Component.unique],
  Text.From([AllSheets.Component])},&quot;,&quot;))

Removing Master Component column:
= Table.RemoveColumns(#&quot;add de-duped&quot;,{&quot;Master Component&quot;})

and this is the result:

Finally we need to group the rows by Id. Home-&gt;Group By allows to group but it doesn't provide the function we need to concatenate the values. I took the idea from here: Combining Rows based on the ID of that table to change the script and replace the Max function for example by Text.Combine and here is the final result in PQ:

The rest is just  Close &amp; Load the result in an new Sheet that is named MasterUpdated:

Here is the entire PQ M script:
let
    Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=&quot;TB_Master&quot;]}[Content],

73248689,Is there any reason I should include a header in the associated cpp file if the former only provides declarations the latter defines?,"Consider a foo.cpp file with the following content
#include &quot;foo.hpp&quot;
int foo() {
    return 7;
}

and its associated header
#pragma once
int foo();

The latter is obviously needed to make aware the following main function of the existence of foo:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;foo.hpp&quot; // to make the name `foo` available

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; foo() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

However, the #include &quot;foo.hpp&quot; seems to be redundant. Is there any reason I should keep it?

I've seen this practice in the codebase where I work on, but I guess there's many examples available in open source. For instance, as an example picked at random, look at src/builtin_builtin.h and src/builtin_bultin.cpp from the fish-shell code base: the former, beside the include guard, has
just

one #include,
two class declarations,
and a function declaration.

One could put 2 in a fwd header, include it in the cpp file together with 1, and then the cpp file wouldn't need anymore to include its own header.
","c++, include, header-files, declaration, translation-unit",0,73258541,"Some reasons to include the header (fpp.hpp) from its implementation file (fpp.cpp):

If you include foo.hpp first in foo.cpp, then compilation of foo.cpp acts as a test that foo.hpp is self-contained, meaning it can be successfully compiled without including anything else first.  The Google C++ coding guidelines specifically recommend including the associated header first.

It is good practice for foo.hpp to declare everything that foo.cpp exports, and for everything else in foo.cpp to have internal linkage in order to not pollute the global namespace.  The GCC option -Wmissing-declarations will report deviations from that practice, but it only works if foo.cpp includes foo.hpp.

Sometimes (often, in fact), including foo.hpp is needed so foo.cpp will compile.  Most commonly, foo.hpp defines a type that foo.cpp needs, but it can also happen that function declarations are needed due to use before definition.  I recommend to just do so consistently rather than trying to deduce whether it's necessary in each case.

Occasionally, the compiler can diagnose mismatches between declarations and definitions.  A nasty case I've seen is a header declaring a global int x but the implementation file defining long x.  Waste a day debugging that mistake, and I predict you'll resolve to include the associated header every time thereafter!


Finally, there are no good reasons not to include the associated header.  In particular, omitting that include will almost never make a measurable difference to compile time.  There are ways of dramatically improving compile times by restructuring header dependencies (for example, use of forward headers), but this isn't one of them.

74214892,React-Native pass useState to navigation Screen and updating FlatList,"I am trying to use react-navigation and pass useState between the screen, and having it render a flatlist.
It correctly updates the flatlist if i go back to the previous screen and then back to the commentscreen, meanwhile nothing happens when just pressing the button.
The setup is basically like this in my App.js file I have the following
....
 &lt;Stack.Screen
  name=&quot;CommentScreen&quot;
  component={CommentScreen}
  options={{ title: &quot;CommentScreen&quot; }}
  initialParams={{ comments: getComments, setComments: setComments }}

Where the comments are from the following
...
var comments= [
    {
        comment_id: &quot;1&quot;,
        post_id: &quot;1&quot;,
        user: &quot;user&quot;,
        comment: &quot;comment1&quot;
    }
]
const [getComments, setComments] = useState((comments));
...

Then in my commentScreen.js file i have the following, which is basically just a flatlist, an input field with a button to update the state with a new comment. Where the getter / setter is passed from App.js
export default function CommentScreen({navigation, route}){

    const [currentComment, setCurrentComment] = useState(&quot;&quot;);
    const addComment = (message) =&gt; {
        route.params.setComments(

                &lt;/View&gt;
            &lt;/View&gt;
        &lt;/View&gt;
    )
}

The renderItem function Comment is defined as follows in Comment.js
export default function Comment({item}){
    return(
    &lt;View style={styles.item}&gt;
      &lt;Text style={styles.title}&gt;
        {item.user}
      &lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;Text style={styles.comment}&gt;
        {item.comment}
      &lt;/Text&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
    );
  }

So something does happen, since if I go back and forth after adding a comment it shows up, but simply pressing the button nothing happens.
Thanks for the help!
","javascript, node.js, react-native, react-hooks",0,74232609,"I recommend that you use Redux, as it centralize your application state.
React-redux
Here's how it works, imagine you have an app that contains two main screens, HomeScreen.js and OptionScreen.js.
1-Inside HomeScreen.js you have a View component
2-Inside OptionScreen.js you have a Button component
If we want to change the color of the View based on if Button is clicked or not, using useState, we will have to create a state for that color in the top parent component, which contains the two main screens, then pass it all the way down to the Button and View components, which is so messy and complicated.
Here's where Redux comes to play, we simply create a &quot;state file&quot; aside, and make the desired components listen to it.
Button clicked ---&gt; state in redux changed to dark
state in redux changed ---&gt; View will re-render and cause its color to change.

It seems the server's response states that it is gzip-encoded, but requests failed to decode it when it treated it as gzipped. This could be a server misconfiguration, or something more subtle. Try to request a non-compressed response by specifying the Accept-Encoding header (though it is possible the server will not respect your request):
headers = { 'Accept-Encoding': 'identity' }
page = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

You can also check whether you can access the URL using other tools, like curl, or your web browser. Additionally, you can explicitly check the raw response to see what the server is actually sending you. But it seems contacting the webmaster of the URL in question might be the real solution.

74393426,Why are NaN floats?,"Division by zero can lead to the apparition of objects, which, while being typed as numbers, are not valid numbers. This led to the creation of NaNs values for numeric data types, mostly used in floating point arithmetic (and hence in most programming float types).
Since division by zero could also occur when manipulating integers, why doesn't a 'NaN integer' exist?
I am looking for a documented answer on programmatic constraints explaining this pattern.
","floating-point, integer, nan",0,74393590,"Because all integers are consistent, have a value.
A 8 bit unsigned integers goes from 00000000 to 11111111, and all those values have a clear, defined, value, that is from 0 to 255.
Which one of those value would you sacrifice to code a 8 bit unsigned integer NaN? 255 maybe. But then, you sacrifice lot of possible applications. You can't use 8 bits unsigned integer to handle bytes (since they are in [0,256)). Nor use them to manipulate images (white (255,255,255) pixels would be (NaN, NaN, NaN)). Etc.
Not even mentionning all the optimization that becomes impossible if 11111111 unsigned 8bits int means NaN, but 11111111 signed bits int means -1 (which it has to do)
Sure, you could use 16 bits integer instead. But that would be to need twice as much memory for all those applications (and those happen to be the kind of applicative usage that makes sometimes even 64Gb memory insufficient. I am currently working on a such an application, where my buffer images use all of my 64 Gb. It would be to much cost to half my buffer capacity, just because of a remote possibility that I might need to encode an integer NaN).
Because, that is another reason why it is not so: why would someone need that? I mean, NaN means &quot;Not a number&quot;. That is it means that the bits stored in a memory place where a number should be, do not, in reality, represent a number.
It is different for floats. Because classical IEEE encoding of floats makes some combination of bits meaningless (or special). Not much. It is not like it was 1 unused bit, or anything remotely similar. Just a few impossible values among billions of possible ones. But still, some combination of bits are not valid. Or, more precisely, we gave them some special meaning, including NaN.
For int, it is up to you to decide that, for your application, you can sacrifice a value. For example, if you are storing dice outputs, you have more than enough choice to decide that one value (-1, 0, 7, 99, ... anything but 1,2,3,4,5 or 6)  will have a special meaning for you (such as &quot;the dice was not rolled&quot;). The system can't take the responsibility to sacrifice some combination of bits, that is some possible values, to make same special, even for those who don't need any such special value.
For float, well, since there are already a few impossible/redundant combination of bits it cost nothing to give them special names.

74595002,What is the difference between SingletonScope. Function & Host in Azure WebJob,"What is the difference between SingletonScope? Function &amp; Host in Azure WebJob?
I have Time trigger hosted in two regions in AKS. I want to ensure that only one instance runs every time.
All my instances are sharing the same storage account. Can I use one of the above settings to configure my scenario?
","azure, azure-functions, azure-webjobs",0,74613125,"
Difference between WebJob host and Azure function:

The host is a runtime container for functions. The Host listens for triggers and calls functions.
In version 3.x, the host is an implementation of IHost.
In version 2.x, you use the JobHost object.
You create a host instance in your code and write code to customize its behavior.
This is a key difference between using the WebJobs SDK directly and using it indirectly through Azure Functions.
In Azure Functions, the service controls the host, and you can't customize the host by writing code.
Azure Functions lets you customize host behavior through settings in the host.json file.
For more information, see Compare the WebJobs SDK and Azure Functions

What is Singleton?

The Singleton attribute ensures that only one instance of a function runs, even when there are multiple instances of the host web app. The Singleton attribute uses distributed locking to ensure that one instance runs.
As in below example, only a single instance of the ProcessImage function runs at any given time:
[Singleton]
public static async Task ProcessImage([BlobTrigger(&quot;images&quot;)] Stream image)
{
     // Process the image.

To learn more about how the SingletonMode.Function works see: https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/SingletonMode.cs
Further you can specify a scope expression/value on a singleton. The expression/value ensures that all executions of the function at a specific scope will be serialized.

73144075,How do you get a single table column to continue onto next column of page instead of one column on every page in ASP.NET MVC C#?,"I am trying to design a pdf view page for product labels in asp.net mvc c#. Basically, I want there to be two columns on the page with 5 rows (so 10 total labels per page). Based on a form where certain products are selected, the form pulls up the pdf view of the labels (which I use Rotativa for) and it inserts the products selected from form into the labels to print. I have it working perfectly as far as getting the data to the labels, but its only displaying as a single column per page. I'd like after the column on each page reaches the end of the page, instead continuing onto the next page, it flows over to the next column on page. I tried doing another  section and copied the same fields to it from column one but it just shows the same duplicate record per row. I've tried alot of different things I've read online and none of it is working such as display: block or block-inline, I've tried in css setting column-count: 2;. Everything I'm finding online they have multiple fields or columns. I have just one . It's weird that it repeats all the way down the page on the left half of the page but won't continue onto the right half. Here's a basic example of what I want:
[ label from record 1 ]   [ label from record 6 ]
[ label from record 2 ]   [ label from record 7 ]
[ label from record 3 ]   [ label from record 8 ]
[ label from record 4 ]   [ label from record 9 ]
[ label from record 5 ]   [ label from record 10]

74543810,Im making a PropHunt game in roblox but the whenever i morph the player character into a new form the UI keeps on being called,"I have this project, im creating a prophunt game, however im in a little road block that i can't understand.
Here is how my code works, I have a local script which tells me which team the player is in, since the player does not have a team yet they are always assumed as neutral, then the local script is called whenever the players are added, which a GUI appears, allowing for them to pick the team.
Heres what i did for the Local script GUI, I'm just learning this for now so not really the best way i could have coded it right now, but it does simulate what i want to happen.
Player.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    if player.Team == TeamService.Blue then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = true
    end
end)

Hiders.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function(player)
    
    
    local result = ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(TeamHiders)
    print(result)
    if result == true then
        Frame.Visible = false
    else
        Frame.Visible = false
    end
end)

Here's what i did for the server script to assign the players a team, I'm sorry I'm still fairly new to roblox so i don't know if my approach is correct im just going with what closely gets me to the output.
game.ReplicatedStorage.RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke = function (player, Team)
    

    
    if Team == teamService.Blue then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(ChoosenTeam)
        return &quot;player Team is blue&quot;
    end
    
    if Team == teamService.Red then
        player.Team = Team
        
        print(player.Team)
        return &quot;player Team is red&quot;
    end

end

And here is my script for the Morph, so i got this click detector which should tell the game that whenever its clicked transform the player into whatever form this is scripted on.
local model = script.Parent.Parent
script.Parent.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    
    if player.Team == teamservice.Blue then
        
        local oldCharacter = player.Character
        local newCharacter = model:Clone()

        newCharacter.HumanoidRootPart.Anchored = false
        newCharacter:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(oldCharacter.PrimaryPart.CFrame)

        player.Character = newCharacter
        newCharacter.Parent = workspace 
    end 
end)


The players under blue side should only encounter this once since the UI should only appear when they do not have a team or are loaded in the game, but what happens is the blue players whenever they morph into a block they encounter the GUI prompt again.
I was expecting by limiting the player teams to nil it would only show the UI, and if the player has a team already then the UI would not show itself, the same goes to when the player decides to morph the player UI should not be visible.

73903603,Is it possible to have race condition with golang chan?,"My goal is to create a simple websocket server. I use chan to distribute the message e.g by invoking &lt;-messageChan. the messageChan have many writers and readers.
However, this StackOverflow question scares me of causing an unintentionally deadlock.
What I've did:

Create a test that essentially do:

populate a chan int with 0 to 1000.
create 100 goroutine to invoke &lt;-chan and add it to a map[int]bool.
invoke t.Fatal if len(map[int]bool) is not 1000. In other words, race condition.



However, the test did not fail. I am afraid, I did something wrong, and chan can have deadlock.
The code
main_test.go
package main

import (
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;sync&quot;
    &quot;testing&quot;
)

type MapMux struct {
    sync.RWMutex

}

func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
    mux.RLock()
    if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
        log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
    }
    mux.RUnlock()
    mux.Lock()
    mux.m[i] = true
    mux.Unlock()
    mux.Done()
}

func TestChanRaceCondition(t *testing.T) {
    l := 1000
    c := make(chan int, l)
    defer close(c)
    for i := 0; i &lt; l; i++ {
        c &lt;- i
    }

    mux := MapMux{sync.RWMutex{}, map[int]bool{}, sync.WaitGroup{}}

    mux.Add(l)

    for i := 0; i &lt; 100; i++ {
        go func(key int) {
            for {
                payload := &lt;-c

                mux.AddInt(payload)
            }
        }(i)
    }

    mux.Wait()

    if len(mux.m) != l {
        t.Fatal(&quot;expected len:&quot;, l, &quot;, actual len:&quot;, len(mux.m))
    }
}

Edit:

The code finds duplicates in the map[int]bool field. Edit: This is because defer close(c). I should have check is the channel was open for every operation.

Anyway, this is what I learn. Hope this help new Golangers.
Lesson learnt:

it is okay to have many writers and many readers for one channel.
always check val, isOpen := &lt;-chan. If isOpen == false, then stop using the channel.
sync.RWMutex.RLock() does not guarantee other goroutine from making changes to the map. So, becareful. This is how it should be done.
 func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
     mux.RLock()
     if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
         log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
     }
     mux.RUnlock()
     mux.Lock()
     if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
         log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)
     }
     mux.m[i] = true
     mux.Unlock()
     mux.Done()
 }



",go,0,73903664,"A data race happens if you share memory between goroutines. If you do not share memory between goroutines, the kind of data races you are afraid of will not happen. There can be other race conditions, such as the one you have in your AddInt method. The correct version should be:
func (mux *MapMux) AddInt(i int) {
    mux.RLock()
    if _, isExist := mux.m[i]; isExist {
        log.Fatal(&quot;race condition&quot;)

    }
    mux.m[i] = true
    mux.Unlock()
    mux.Done()
}

This is because there is no guarantee that another goroutine changes the map between RUnlock and Lock.
In your example, you are sharing a map between goroutines. That means you have to protect all access to it using a mutex. If you do that, there will be no data races around the use of that map.
However, in general, if you can avoid sharing memory, your program will not have such data races.

I have written this code in C and expected the output to be either an error
or maybe s2 will be {'H', 'e', '\0'} but the actual output was a &quot;Hello&quot; (without &quot;&quot;) just like s1

Looks like valgrind has provided a clue that something is wrong here. Let's try debugging it.

(gdb) p s2
$2 = &quot;Hel&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s2
$3 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;

From the above debug session you can kind of see what is really going on:

Because gdb knows that s2 is only a three-byte array, printing it out dislays Hel.
You can see by printing out s1 that the remainder of the string has overflowed into s1.

Why did it do this? It's due how how the variables were laid out on the stack when you ran the program. You can check for yourself by dumping the stack in gdb:
(gdb) p $sp
$4 = (void *) 0x7fffffffd7c0
(gdb) p &amp;s1
$5 = (char (*)[6]) 0x7fffffffd7d2
(gdb) p &amp;s2
$6 = (char (*)[3]) 0x7fffffffd7cf

This shows the in-memory addresses of the stack, and the addresses of s1 and s2. By printing out a hex dump of the stack, you can also visualize this:
(gdb) dump binary memory stackdump $sp $sp+32
(gdb) shell xxd stackdump
00000000: e9dc ffff ff7f 0000 6400 0000 0000 0048  ........d......H
00000010: 656c 6c6f 006c 6f00 0002 9cd6 42c9 4be5  ello.lo.....B.K.

You can see from the above that 15 bytes into the stack is where s2 was, and confirm that as follows:
(gdb) p (char*) $sp+15
$7 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s2
$8 = 0x7fffffffd7cf &quot;Hello&quot;

... and similarly, you can see that s1 was 18 bytes into the stack and has been overwritten by the write to s2:
(gdb) p (char*) $sp+18
$10 = 0x7fffffffd7d2 &quot;lo&quot;
(gdb) p (char*) s1
$11 = 0x7fffffffd7d2 &quot;lo&quot;

73547364,"Create a BaseComponent for web components, and refer to component name once","I have noticed there are a few common/repeated methods I keep reusing in some web components I am working on. When I change the method in one, if I want the improvement in the others, I have to open each one and make the changes to all the other components, which is tedious and error prone. So I am trying to create a BaseComponent which the other components inherit from.
The issue is I would like to define the component name, e.g. wc-thingy in one place, keep it DRY. However this name is requried in two places:

Pivot Point: 2

[Test1, DEF, 345, A2]
[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]
[Test3, JKL, 901, A4]

If instead you pass &quot;foo&quot; as the key, the original list is printed out:
Pivot Point: -1
[Test0, ABC, 123, A1]
[Test3, JKL, 901, A4]
[Test1, DEF, 345, A2]
[Test4, MNO, 234, A5]
[Test2, GHI, 678, A3]

Just a clarifying note, the List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; has to be mutable since the contents of the list needs to be changed for sorting. However, since I did not intended to change any of the List&lt;String&gt;, I created those using List.of() to make them immutable. If you attempt to mutate these lists, an exception will be thrown.

So if your reason for using an alternative ID is to avoid disclosing post ID values (maybe for security reasons) don't bother. They are already available.
Plus, if you use an alternative ID you'll probably need to store it as a post attribute in wp_postmeta in your database. That is, putting it mildly, not the best-performing part of WordPress.

74227793,ImageSharp RecolorBrush not available anymore?,"I'm using ImageSharp version 2.1.3 in a .NET 6 project. Now the API which I can use seems to be different from what is shown in the official documentation. For instance the docs are pointing to a namespace SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing which is not part of the NuGet package I received.
One thing I cannot find is the RecolorBrush documented here. It allows me to replace a color with another one like this:
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing.Processing;

using (var image = Image.Load('file.png'))
{
    var brush = new RecolorBrush(Color.White, Color.Transparent, 0.2F);
    image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx.Fill(brush));
    image.Save('transparent.png');
}

Several things are now not working:

RecolorBrush is not a thing in my Nuget.
ctx.Fill seems to be no longer available.

So am I missing a package, is this a breaking change and if yes what is the new way to do it and where can I find some official info on this?

73682305,How to debug missing functions in vtable of base class,"By using objects of the following structure(some bits simplified):
  class RafkoAgent{
    virtual std::vector&lt;double&gt; solve(std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; in) = 0;
    void solve(std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; in, std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; out){
      out = solve(in);
    }
  };

  class SolutionSolver : public RafkoAgent {
    std::vector&lt;double&gt; solve(std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; in){ /* ... */}
  };

In some cases a segfault is being thrown.
In my understanding, this structure should be adequate, but in the example I tried it in(here), it throws a segfault and I can't seem to get to the bottom of it.
In the code, when I check the vtable of the 2 symbols I find the following difference:
150   solver-&gt;solve({1.0, 2.0});
(gdb) info vtbl solver
This object does not have a virtual function table

Which suggest to me that something is not quite right with the vtable for RafkoAgent. The actual segfault is thrown when it tries to access its virtual function, and instead of solve, gdb seem to step into get_step_names, which is at the end of RafkoAgent's displayed vtable.
An additional detail is that the whole project is a static library + tests. When I run the same code inside the CMake project of the library ( i.e.: where RafkoAgent and SolutionSolver is) the segfault does not occur. It does occur however in the linked example file, where I link the classes from a generated static library file (librafko.a)
The focus of the question is:
Is it by design for a base class to not contain its defined virtual functions in its own vtable, only the derived class? even if the derived class does not introduce additional virtual functions?
If what I'm seeing is faulty how might I be able to debug the root cause of this error?
","c++, c++17, static-libraries, virtual-functions, vtable",0,73814247,"The root cause of the problem was that there were compilation macros used in the exported header files.
The main hint for this was that in the same repository it worked flawlessly, but it failed by the exported library.
The faulty structure was as follows:
class A {};

class B 
#if(compile_time_macro)
: public A
#endif
{};

So essentially the library object was built as if the inheritance was included, but since the exported headers did not contain the macro definition, the inheritance was not present there.
This resulted in a very hardly traceable problem.
Whenever you use macros BEWARE.

73165456,ClojureDart: How to pass data to parent state widget?,"I have a Scaffold parent widget where I defined a variable transforms that contains a vector of Offset.
The child widget is supposed to display those points with CustomPainter.
For now, I just passed my variable transforms as an argument to the child widget.
The problem is, I want to add an element to my vector each time we pressed the floatingActionButton, which is written in my parent widget ; and when I click on it, it does not appear on the screen (the child doesn't get the information).
So how to make widgets communicate?
","flutter, clojure",2,73165457,"The answer is pretty simple.
The way for a widget to inherit informations from another, is to used the f/widget function and the :inherit keyword. Example:
(f/widget
:inherit [m/Theme]
)

In order to inherit from the Theme widget and its internal state data.
But that is not it, in the parent widget you want to make your data available/sharable, you have to define your data in the :bind map.
Example:
(def child
  (f/widget
    :inherit [:transforms]
;; don't forget to dereference it when you want to use it
;; (dart:core/print @transforms)
...))

(def parent
  (f/widget
    :bind {:transforms [(m/Offset 0 0) (m/Offset 1 0)]}

73531936,Using svelte actions to manipulate an html element with d3,"this is somewhat related to my previous post where I learned a bit more about actions.
I have been trying to figure out how to work with this nifty feature but I seem to be a bit stuck in the past few hours.
In my Component I create an SVG viewbox like so:
&lt;svg id=&quot;pitch&quot; viewBox={`0 0 ${width} ${height}`} use:foo&gt;

    &lt;/svg&gt;

then drawPitch is this function:
function foo(node) {
        // the node has been mounted in the DOM
        let g = node.append('h1');
        g.text(&quot;This is the text I'd like to render to check that it works&quot;);
        return {
            destroy() {
                // the node has been removed from the DOM
            }
        };
    }

From what I've understood in the docs, the use:foo will pass the calling node to foo, so I thought directly appending svg elements to it should work.
Do I need to update it somehow?
Here is a repl with reproducible code.
I get the following error:

Missing &quot;./types/runtime/internal/keyed_each.js&quot; export in &quot;svelte&quot; package

Thank you!
","d3.js, svelte, sveltekit",0,73531996,"I would expect the code in foo to start with d3.select(node), and everything to work based off that. Otherwise the DOM tree generated by d3 will not be connected to your document at all. Alternatively the resulting element (selection.node()) has to be appended to node at some point.
The error sounds highly unrelated and probably would require more context.
Note: You cannot add HTML directly to SVGs, SVGs are for canvas-like vector graphics, not document layouts. If you want to insert text, use the &lt;text&gt; element.

I have tasks with precedence and, for some of them, required &amp; forbidden resources.
I need to decide when to start a task &amp; who to assign to it.
To do so, I'm using an array of decision variable resource_allocation:
array[Tasks, Resources] of var 0..1: resource_allocation; %Selection of resources per task.

To manage the required/forbidden resources, I used the following:
% Mandatory &amp; Forbidden constraint allocation
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_required[t])(resource_allocation[t,r]=1);
constraint forall(t in Tasks, r in resource_forbidden[t])(resource_allocation[t,r]=0);

resource_required being set of int storing the resources number that are required/forbidden.
Each resource represents 1 worker, and each worker can only perform one task at a time, so I am trying to state that, for every resources, the cumsum of allocation can at max be 1.
It might be important to note that start is also a decision variable.
 % Constraint allocated to only one task at a time
    constraint forall(t in Resources)(
        cumulative(start, duration, [resource_allocation[t, r] | t in Tasks], 1)

As far as I can tell, the geocoding intersection search only works for US-based addresses. I've tried different combinations of the country, proximity and bbox parameters to no success.
US-based addresses work:

&quot;Market Street and Fremont Street, San Francisco&quot; (used in the docs example)
&quot;Broadway and Columbus Avenue, New York&quot;

Non US-based addresses don't work at all:

&quot;Collins Street and William Street, Melbourne&quot;
&quot;Eagle Street and Queen Street, Brisbane&quot;
&quot;George Street and Grosvenor Street, Sydney&quot;
&quot;Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, London&quot;
&quot;Avenue Des Champs-Élysées and Place Charles de Gaulle, Paris&quot;

How do I get Mapbox geocoding intersection search to work for non-US addresses?
If this is not possible, is it documented anywhere? Nothing in the docs indicates that this is not available world-wide, and I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't be.
","mapbox, geojson, geocoding, mapbox-gl-js, mapbox-api-geocoding",0,73659373,"You can use Mapbox's geocoding API playground to try various queries. Based on my testing, it seems clear that intersection queries always resolve to the US, or to something other than an intersection.

I doubt it is possible.

Not that I can see.

Geocoders are built from lots of different data sources in different regions, with lots of different rules.
It's hard to imagine why Mapbox would deliberately introduce this limitation, but easy to imagine how it could unintentionally come to be. You may wish to contact them directly.

73125825,Is it correct to define a global static const std::string in a header file,"Is it correct to define a global std::string in a header file like this :
namespace Colors
{
    static const std::string s_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;
}

",c++,1,73126069,"Correct?
Yes. static here means that each translation unit (TU) that includes this header will have a unique object. So there isn't 1 s_blue object for the whole project, but one for each TU.
However since it's const all objects will be equal, so for the user it doesn't make a difference.
Recommended?
Maybe, depends.
The big downside is that you create multiple objects and all of them are initialized at program startup.
Another possible downside is the access pattern. If the program assesses s_blue from multiple TUs in quick succession it could trash the cache.
However for certain programs and scenarios this could be the best option or at least &quot;good enough&quot;. For instance (spoiler for next paragraph) in a header only library or before C++17.
Are there better alternatives?
Yes, but they cannot always be used.
extern
Make it an extern declaration in the header and in just 1 TU have the definition.
// constants.hpp
extern const std::string k_blue;

// constants.cpp
#include &quot;constants.hpp&quot;
const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

This is clearly superior in terms of performance over OP. However you can't use it in a header only lib.
Even in a normal program static could be preferred as the ease of declaring and defining the constants in just one place could be seen as outweighing the performance downsides in specific projects.
constexpr inline string_view C++17
A clearly better alternative if it's available (since C++17) is string_view. It's very light weight but has all the amenities of a modern container (unlike raw const char[]). And since you already are in C++17 you should make it constexpr inline:
constexpr inline std::string_view k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

inline const std::string c++17
If for whatever reason you need std::string over std::string_view you can inline the variable for better optimization:
inline const std::string k_blue = &quot;Blue&quot;;

73475744,Terraform - 'Objects have changed outside of Terraform' for a new Azure resource group,"I have been experimenting with terraform with the following basic configuration file for creating a resource group...
resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;myrg&quot; {
  name = &quot;MyResourceGroup&quot;
  location = &quot;westeurope&quot;
}

output resource_group_details {
  value = azurerm_resource_group.myrg
}


First terraform plan - 1 resource will be created
First terraform apply - 1 resource created
Second terraform plan (with no changes made to the configuration file) - Objects have changed outside of Terraform (See below)
Second terraform apply - Objects have changed outside of Terraform, 0 added/changed/detroyed
Third terraform plan (with no changes made to the configuration file) - No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last &quot;terraform apply&quot; which may have
affected this plan:

  # azurerm_resource_group.myrg has changed
  ~ resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;myrg&quot; {
        id       = &quot;/subscriptions/176f2ee3-d0a2-476d-9106-43cad1f63f16/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup&quot;
        name     = &quot;MyResourceGroup&quot;
      + tags     = {}
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
    }

Based on what I've tried to find about this online, it looks like this warning is because Azure adds an empty tag array to a resource group during creation. Then when terraform compares the now existing resource with the configuration file and state, it's now warning you there is a difference. I'm not quite sure how terraform reconciles this on the third terraform plan though....
What should be the workflow here? Particularly when thinking about CI?
It appears to just be noise to be informed of the existence of an empty, optional attribute that I haven't defined.
I've looked at -refresh=false but it looks like this could suppress a genuine change that has occurred on your infrastructure that you may want to be notified about. When using -refresh-only on the second terraform plan and apply it just outputs the same noise as above.
","azure, azure-devops, terraform, terraform-provider-azure",1,73475981,"Indeed, what you have observed here is a small bug in the Azure provider where it is being inconsistent between the object it returns during apply and the object it returns during refresh.
It is typically okay for a provider to insert a default value for an argument that wasn't set, which is what seems to be happening here, but a provider ought to be consistent in doing so in all of its results: in the initial plan, in the new state created after apply, and in the refreshed state created on the next plan. Terraform produces this message in particular if the refreshed state created on the next plan is different than the new state that was created by the previous apply.

One way to hide the bug would be to explicitly set the tags argument to the default value that the provider's refresh step is inserting:
resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;myrg&quot; {
  name     = &quot;MyResourceGroup&quot;
  location = &quot;westeurope&quot;

  tags = {}
}

As long as the provider logic doesn't treat an empty map as special during plan and apply (which I'm not sure about), this should hopefully cause the initial result to agree with the refreshed result and thus avoid showing an incorrect &quot;changed outside of Terraform&quot; note.

Another separate answer is to change your output value to return more specific attributes of the resource group, so that Terraform can see that the end result doesn't depend on the tags attribute.
Terraform shows this message in an attempt to explain why the resource_group_details output value is also planned to change, and so Terraform shouldn't show the message if it can be sure that your output value won't be affected by the change to the tags. For example:
output &quot;resource_group_details&quot; {
  value = {
    name     = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
    location = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    # (...and any other attributes you want to export,
    # as long as you don't refer to &quot;tags&quot;.)
  }
}

Note that this rule generally applies to anything in your configuration that may directly or indirectly refer to the tags attribute, so if there's more to your configuration that you didn't show here then you should also make sure that nothing else refers to tags.
Terraform's analysis of this is not fully precise, so if it isn't sure that there aren't any references to tags then it will still show the note just in case. Therefore you would need to stick to relatively simple expressions that refer directly to individual attributes of azurerm_resource_group.myrg, and avoid using expressions which do dynamic work with the entire resource object which would prevent Terraform's analysis from proving that the tags attribute is unused.

Any advices is appreciated. Thanks
","swift, uiscrollview, uikit",0,74563806,"You are setting the stack view axis to Vertical -- but you want Horizontal scrolling... so set it to .horizontal.
You are setting Height for each arranged subview, but you haven't set the Widths... so give them Widths.
You should constrain the scroll view's content to the scroll view's Content Layout Guide.
Because you're setting varying Heights, it's not quite clear if you want only horizontal scrolling... so this example ends up scrolling both directions:

This code works perfectly on VirtualBox, but when I try to run it on my PC (by copying it into a flash drive and booting from it), something very strange happens. The cursor is moved to the bottom-right area of the screen and prints off a strange character (An O but with an arrow coming off at the NE corner). Pressing a key causes it to clear the screen, the cursor jumps around before printing off another one of these characters. What is going on?
I have tried to follow the advice in Assembly boot loader working on virtual PC, not on real PC (setting all registers to zero, validating the stack) but it still did not work on the real hardware. (Still works fine on Virtualbox).

First, we cleared the segments to ensure that BIOS didn't give us junk values that will cause trouble later. We also cleared the code segments to make sure that we are in address 0x0000:0x7c00 instead of its equivalents such as 0x07c0:0x0000. I formatted the code, and move the data down so you can manipulate them easier. Your code also lacked padding and signature which were added. I also added some MBR partition tables in case you are booting from harddrive or equivalent system. You could also add a BPB, you can find the structure to that here:
https://wiki.osdev.org/FAT#BPB_.28BIOS_Parameter_Block.29
The above code can be compiled with
nasm -fbin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.bin

I used debug in the above example but you can use that loop in any other task.
If for some reason (that we cannot guess from your question and that I really have a hard time to understand...) you really need to transform the variable name, some of the key names and the number of keys inside each item, you can still keep the KISS principle (although it makes by itself things too complex compared to using the original var directly IMO).
- name: make a var out of an other var
  vars:

  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    mdisk: &quot;{{ ansible_disks | json_query(query) }}&quot;


Now to answer your direct question if you still want to do the above transformation and construct the variable through an iteration, you can. But this is in all respect the least efficient scenario.
- name: make a var out of an other var
  vars:
    current_disk:
      name: &quot;{{ item.friendly_name }}&quot;
      firmware_version: &quot;{{ item.firmware_version }}&quot;

}

","javascript, arrays, object, merge, grouping",1,73420289,"This is a good opportunity to show off the neat javascript spread syntax, Array and Object prototype functions, and destructuring patterns.
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries).reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]: [...acc[k]||[], v] }), {})

As simple as this!

Extended answer

Object.values takes the values of all properties of an object and makes a list out of them. The rules of iteration are same as for...in
For example:
Object.values(obj1)
// The result will be:
[{a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8}, {a:6,b:9,c:10,d:12,e:1}, {a:3,b:4,c:9}]


Object.entries is similar to Object.values above, but it generates a list of [key, val] pairs instead, one for each property.
For example:
Object.entries({a:5,b:6,c:7,d:8})
// The result will be:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]]


Array.flatMap applies the passed function on all elements of an array (just like map), but in the end, it flattens the result. That means, if the result is a list of lists, it returns only one big array with all inner elements.
For example:
Object.values(obj1).flatMap(Object.entries)
// By passing Object.entries as function,
// it will extract all the key-value pairs in one big list
[['a',5],['b',6],['c',7],['d',8], ['a',6],['b',9],['c',10],['d',12],['e',1], ['a',3],['b',4],['c',9]]


The spread syntax (...) is a neat feature of javascript, that is used to semantically refer to the enumeration of something.

When used in array literals, you can merge and append values together to form a bigger array.
Like this:
 o = {a: [5, 6]}

 o.a = [...o.a, 3]     // all elements from o.a, appending 3
 { a:[5, 6, 3] }

 o.d = [...o.d, 8]     // TypeError: o.d is undefined
 o.d = [...o.d||[], 8] // if o.d is undefined, use [], then append 8
 { a:[5, 6, 3], d:[8] }

 // This is useful as a semantic: &quot;append to list or create a new one&quot;

[Note 1]: o.d||[] works because undefined is falsy and the logical OR operator || short circuits.

When the spread syntax is used in object literals, you can merge objects together or append new properties.
Like this:
o = { 
  ...o,                       // all properties of o
  ...{b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9]}, // all properties of the literal
  d: [...o.d||[], 12],        // overriding property d
  ['e']: [1]                  // new property with computed name
}
// Result will be:      
{ a:[5,6,3], b:[6,9,4], c:[7,10,9], d:[8,12], e:[1] }




Array.reduce iterates over a list, applying the passed function and accumulating the results. In the end, it returns the accumulated value. The returned value depends on the operation performed by the passed function.
For example, you can use reduce to sum over all elements of an array.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; curr + acc, 0)
// It is the same as (((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)
15

However, you can also use reduce to take [key, val] pairs from a list and make them properties into an object (like Object.fromEntries, but more flexible).
This snippet below uses a destructuring pattern to unpack the [k, v] pairs passed as function parameter, and uses [k] as computed property name.
See:
[['a',5], ['b',6], ['c',7], ['d',8]].reduce(
  (acc, [k, v]) =&gt; ({ ...acc, [k]:v }), {})
// The result will be:

73106769,WebStorm/IntelliJ does not associate TypeScript file type,"I cannot get IntelliJ/WebStorm to associate a &quot;.ts&quot; file as TypeScript file.
I have created a file named confirmationRequiredRenderer. Initially I created this file by just creating a text file and then adding a .ts at the end of the file name.

Now, no matter what I do, I cannot associated this file as a TypeScript file type. It thinks it is a text file.
These are the actions I have gone through to fix this problem and nothing has worked:

rebuild project
restart IDE
Invalidate caches
creating a TS file through the wizard, and then renaming it
npm build

Any advice on why my IDE is so confused with this file?
","typescript, intellij-idea, webstorm",0,73108311,"
I have created a file named confirmationRequiredRenderer. Initially I created this file by just creating a text file and then adding a .ts at the end of the file name.

That is the source of the problem: the confirmationRequiredRenderer file name is now associated with the Text file type. And it has a &quot;priority&quot; because it's longer/more specific than just default *.ts.
You need to go into the IDE Settings/Preferences and remove such a association for more broad *.ts to be used instead.

Go to Settings/Preferences | Editor | File Types
Locate Text file type there
Locate and remove the offending entry -- should be confirmationRequiredRenderer or very similar to that.
Save the settings, let IDE reindex that file and see how it goes.

If still nothing (pretty unlikely but still possible): it may still have an association in another file type, so may need to check other files types for the same.


P.S. Another alternative is to hard-override the file type for that specific file. Just right click on the file in the Project View panel and choose the right action (Override File Type).
It will work for that specific file but will still be an issue for the file with the same name in another project/another folder. So it's much better to fix the original source of the issue.

74191220,How to disable B frames in FFmpeg for H.264 encoding?,"I'm encoding video with h264_nvenc, and I would like to disable B-Frames. I'm trying to use -bframes 0 parameter, but I'm not sure if it works, and where exactly put the command.
For now, this is my code:
-probesize 10MB -s 1920x1080 -framerate 30 -i video.h264 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p7 -tune 4 -rc:v vbr -cq:v 1 -profile:v high -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1920x1080 -r:v 30 video.h264


Furthermore, should I need to use bframes 0 when I'm already using tune 4 (lossless)?
The original video doesn't have any B-frame.
","ffmpeg, h.264, nvenc",0,74192212,"The FFmpeg option is:

Default value is 0.

In libavcodec/nvenc.c it sets frameIntervalP (0 - intra-only, 1 - IPP, 2 - IBP, 3 - IBBP etc.):

    if (avctx-&gt;max_b_frames &gt;= 0) {

For the older LosslessHP preset the frameIntervalP is 1 (IPP).

While I don't know the exact use case, I'm going to assume it's to copy/paste the content.
I'd recommend grabbing the values of the different content areas you want and putting those into a textarea (you'll almost certainly want the textarea hidden with style=&quot;display:none&quot;).
Then, once the content is all in the textarea, you can copy it to the clipboard programatically.
Then instead of having users hit Ctrl+A, you can provide an easy &quot;Copy&quot; button which is more instructive to people not familiar with the select all shortcut.
Here's a basic example showing the copy function in vanilla JS.
&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

    // fetch the textarea
    var textarea = document.querySelector('textarea');

    // add content to the textarea
    textarea.value = '' // clear it
    textarea.value += 'First Content Area' // this represents content from different parts of your site
    textarea.value += 'Second Content Area' // this represents content from different parts of your site
    textarea.value += 'Third Content Area' // this represents content from different parts of your site

    // copy it to the clipboard
    textarea.focus();
    textarea.select();
    document.execCommand('copy');

73072459,How can use filter and contains with multi-ArrayList in Kotlin so I only have elements which match the condition?,"I have a class called Person
data class Person(
    val id: Int,
    val name: String
)

data class IDs(
    val id : Int,
    val active : Boolean )

and an array list that has numbers of ids and another list of Persons
val myStu = listOf&lt;Person&gt;(Person(1, &quot;Name_1&quot;), Person(2, &quot;Name_2&quot;), Person(3, &quot;Name_3&quot;))
var ids = listOf&lt;IDs&gt;(IDs(1,false),IDs(2,true),IDs(3,true))
var newIds = listOf&lt;Int&gt;(2,3,4,6)

First I want to apply two actions to the myStu, first is to have a list that include all the items from myStu that his id matches the id in the IDS and only if the active is true
myStu or the new list will have the values
Person(2, &quot;Name_2&quot;), Person(3, &quot;Name_3&quot;))

Then do action two , I need to add a new item to the new list that their id does not exist in the newIds , in another word we will add a new person Person(4,&quot;None&quot;) and (6,&quot;None) , 4 and 6 values come from newIds list
the final output will be :
   id= 2 name = &quot;Name_2&quot;, id= 3 name = &quot;Name_3&quot;, id= 4 name = &quot;None&quot; , id =6 name=&quot;None&quot;

I want to write the code with filter , I failed with first step because I don't know how to use contains() with the list inside the filter
val newArr = myStu.filter {
    ids.contains(it.id)
}

","kotlin, filter",0,73072827,"The &quot;easiest&quot; way of doing that would be to use filter directly, there's no need for contains. If we were to use contains, then we would need to also search for which element contained the id, in order to get the status. We can just do a .any() to do both at the same time.
V1
val activeStu = myStu.filter { person -&gt; ids.any { it.id == person.id &amp;&amp; it.active } }

val result = newIds.map { newId -&gt;
    activeStu.find { it.id == newId } ?: Person(id = newId, name = &quot;None&quot;)
}

Another method, that might work a bit better if we have big lists, would be to first transform the IDs list into a map. That way the second part of our code is a bit more efficient, since there is no search involved.
V2
val idsMap = ids.associate { it.id to it.active }
val activeStu = myStu.filter { idsMap[it.id] ?: false }

//the creation of the result list is the same


Version without creating 2 new lists. This works, but it might be quite ineficient processing wise, and also harder to understand what is going on IMO.
V3
val result = newIds.map { newId -&gt;
    //try to find an IDs with the current newId and status as true
    when (ids.find { it.id == newId }?.active) {
        //if found, then find the corresponding Person  
        true -&gt; myStu.find { it.id == newId } ?: Person(newId, &quot;None&quot;) // if this happens, it means that an IDs with status true existed and no Person had that id. Not sure what you want in this scenario, this version creates one of the &quot;none&quot; persons.
        //if not found, then create a new one
        else -&gt; Person(newId, &quot;None&quot;)
    }
}

Note: depending on what version of kotlin you have, you might have to change the when statement to this:
when (ids.find { it.id == newId }?.active == true)

Since I think I remember that null didn't used to be treated as false in old versions (I've run this with version 1.4.20).
Btw, you can also use this version with the idsMap from V2, just replace the when(...) with when(idsMap[newId] or when(idsMap[newId] == true) depending on the kotlin version.

73354989,Remove array duplicates (the old way),"What's up guys, I was just messing arround LeetCode, and different ways to solving this problem (I know the Set way and the for of with array.includes + push, and the filter, but all of them create a new array), and with this method I'm getting this output, can someone explain me why?
P.S. You can't create a new array, just modify the first one.


let nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];

var removeDuplicates = (nums) =&gt; {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === nums[i + 1]) {
      nums.splice(i, i + 1);
    }
  }
};

removeDuplicates(nums);

console.log(nums);
// [0, 1, 3, 4]



",javascript,1,73355071,"The first problem is here: nums.splice(i, i + 1);
Array splice method takes 2 arguments, the first one is the index of element, and the second one is a number of elements to replace/remove (it seems you confused the second argument with the end index). Source: Array.prototype.splice()
Another problem is changing the original array, while iterating over it (be very careful with such in-place manipulations, they very often result in some kind of errors). Look at what is happening in your loop:

You have some array [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
You want to remove the first element, since it is a duplicate: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
After removing, you have [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2];
You increment your i, so now it is equal to 1;
You look at the element with index 1, and find no duplicates [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2], since you just skipped the element, that moved into the first index in place of the removed element.

The solution is to decrement the i after removing the element:


let nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];

var removeDuplicates = (nums) =&gt; {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === nums[i + 1]) {
      nums.splice(i, 1);

Prepend the following line to desktop entry of Gitkraken and replace the USER:

While researching this, I found this post: With python-oracledb what does &#39;DPY-4027: no configuration directory to search for tnsnames.ora&#39; mean But I have no clue why all these extra steps are necessary.
","python, python-oracledb",0,73211052,"I can explain why this is necessary. With cx_Oracle, an Instant Client (or Oracle Database) installation is required. These installations have a default location for tnsnames.ora: &lt;install_dir&gt;/network/admin/tnsnames.ora. So if you put the file in that location you don't need to specify its location. The thin driver doesn't require an Oracle Client (or Database) installation, so there is no default location. So you have to do one of the following:

set the environment variable TNS_ADMIN to point to the location where your tnsnames.ora file is found
pass the location where your tnsnames.ora file is found in your code, as in:

con = oracledb.connect(user=myname, password=mypw, dsn=&quot;myDBprod&quot;,

there was a longer conversation under Ansible Issue #7984 &quot;Ansible substitutes YAML null value with &quot;None&quot; in templates&quot;.

The difference is that the former is language agnostic YAML syntax and the latter is Python specific

Right, such is discussed under the above mentioned issue.
From the discussion there I understand also that such test is meant for testing defined. And since

To check if it is defined and truthy ...  The string &quot;None&quot; evaluates as truthy and defined, the actual python None evaluates as &quot;falsey&quot; and defined.

a test might look like

",java,2,73634220,"The GarbageCollectorMXBean exposes garbage collector information, but only the number of collection runs and total time, and no information of the number of objects collected or memory freed.
So from the standard API, there's no way to get this information.
I assume that this would actually be quite an overhead for any garbage collector implementation to compute the actually freed size, so I doubt that this information can be obtained even from the actual GC implementations.

73683516,"""error: too many arguments to function"" when trying to access vector elements in a function call","I'm writing a program to populate a vector from a list of numbers in a file, and then check the list to see how many numbers appear more than once. The program works when I hard code the array size based on the number of lines in the file. But I want to use a vector to automate the sizing of the array for each file since there are many files to process and each is unique in length.
I'm confused by this error message because I'm pretty certain I have 3 args in the function declaration and definition. The error is attached to line 63, and g++ highlights the closing brace of (i) and (j).

","c++, c++14",-1,73683846,"In C++, () is a function call operator and is used to call the function. For example, when you write main(), you are calling the function main which in turn causes the main function to start executing.
To access an element of a vector, you should use subscript operator [] not function call operator ().
I've highlighted the mistakes in your duplicateSort sort function below:
//           function argument should just list the name without `()` operator          
//                             vvvvvvv
void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list(), int length, int&amp; fpy) {     
      //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
//               vvvvvvv    vvvvvvv   to access element of a vector use [] operator
              if(list(i) == list(j))
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }
          }
      }
  }

To make your program work, change the function as follows:
 void duplicateSort(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;list, int length, int&amp; fpy) {     //sort the list for fpy
      int match = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; length; j++) {
              if(list[i] == list[j])
                  match++;
              if (match == 1) {
                  fpy++;
                  match = 0;
              }

            x(:,:,3)=x(:,:,3)+y(c,3).*((z(:,:,c)-e(c)).^2);
end  

How can I improve calculation speed on this loop? I think that the problem is the for loop with a large c.
","matlab, for-loop, optimization",0,74490954,"It's a myth, but alas a persistent one, that loops are slow in MATLAB.  As you've written your for loop, it goes sequentially through the last dimension of your variables. That pretty much translates to a FORTRAN loop directly, leaving little room for improvement using vectorisation. The below does vectorise your output as much as possible, but doesn't improve performance much, even though reshape() is almost free, and severely degrades readability.
In each iteration, all you're doing is calculating y(c,1).*((z(:,:,c)-e(c)).^2), which is added to the total. If we are able to vectorise that expression, we can sum over the dimension of c to get rid of the loop.
z(:,:,c)-e(c) can be vectorised by adding two singleton dimensions to e: reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)]), then subtract and power by 2 as usual.
Multiplication by  y(c,1) also works, if we add two singleton dimensions to y(:,1):, reshape(y(:,1), [1 1 numel(e)]), then multiply again as usual.
Finally, we just need to sum over our 3rd dimension and we end up with our t -by- t result: sum(tmp2, 3).
All that's left are the hardcoded three dimensions in x, which I've left be in a loop.
The working code on R2007b:
variables=10;
t=2;
x=zeros(t,t,3);
y=rand(variables,3);
z=rand(t,t,variables);
e=rand(variables,1);

for ii = 1:size(x, 3)
    x(:, :, ii) = sum(bsxfun(@times, reshape(y(:,1), [1 1 numel(e)]), bsxfun(@minus, z, reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)])).^2), 3);
end

I wasn't sure what to do with the hardcoded dimension of 3, so I just left a loop over that. The rest is vectorised away, thanks to a few reshape() calls to arrange the dimensions for the bsxfun() expansion.
Code for &gt;R2016b with implicit expansion:
for ii = 1:size(x, 3)
    x(:, :, ii) = sum(reshape(y(:,ii), [1 1 numel(e)]) .* (z -  reshape(e, [1 1 numel(e)])).^2, 3)
end

A quick timing comparison shows that this is roughly 2x faster than your original loop:
Elapsed time is 0.780516 seconds. Original code
Elapsed time is 0.397369 seconds. My bsxfun() solution
Elapsed time is 0.305160 seconds. My implicit expansion

Note that in the above a 100 loops were ran for each code version, i.e. timings are 8ms, 4ms and 3ms per version.

For an introduction to reshape() you can refer to this answer of mine.
The documentation article on implicit broadcasting is rather good, as is this blog.

73134275,Is there a clean way to make declvals for types with no default constructors?,"consider this example:
template&lt;typename T&gt;
concept Iteratable = requires(T n) {
    n.begin();
    n.end();
};

namespace detail {
    template&lt;Iteratable T&gt;
    using subtype = std::decay_t&lt;decltype(*(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().begin()))&gt;;

    template&lt;Iteratable T&gt;
    constexpr auto deepest_subtype_recursive() {

        if constexpr (Iteratable&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;) {
            return detail::deepest_subtype_recursive&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;();
        }
        else {
            return subtype&lt;T&gt;{};
        }
    }
}

template&lt;Iteratable T&gt;
using deepest_subtype = decltype(detail::deepest_subtype_recursive&lt;T&gt;());

A recursive function that calls itself with the subtype, until the type in question is no longer iteratable, then that type is returned. What this enables, is to find the deepest container type at compile time. So e.g. vector&lt;list&lt;deque&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes int:
int main() {

    using container_type = std::vector&lt;std::list&lt;std::deque&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt;;
    using deepest = deepest_subtype&lt;container_type&gt;;

    static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;deepest, int&gt;);
}

using this way of return the value, and finding out the type with decltype is something I do very often, as I can write code that has more room to breathe and doesn't rely on insanley nested std::conditional_ts.

this example breaks, once I apply it on a class that doesn't have a default constructor:
struct foo {
    foo(int) {}
};

int main() {

    using container_type = std::vector&lt;std::list&lt;std::deque&lt;foo&gt;&gt;&gt;;
    using deepest = deepest_subtype&lt;container_type&gt;;

    static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;deepest, foo&gt;);
}


error C2512: 'foo': no appropriate default constructor available

on the line where it says return subtype&lt;T&gt;{};.
I also can't say return std::declval&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;(); as that will give the error error C2338: static_assert failed: 'Calling declval is ill-formed, see N4892 [declval]/2.'

To fix this I had the following idea: Skip the constructor by declaring a pointer, and immediately derefence it. So basically making my own declval:
template&lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr auto declval() {
    using pointer = T*;
    return *(pointer{});
}

namespace detail {
    template&lt;Iteratable T&gt;
    using subtype = std::decay_t&lt;decltype(*(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().begin()))&gt;;

    template&lt;Iteratable T&gt;
    constexpr auto deepest_subtype_recursive() {

        if constexpr (Iteratable&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;) {
            return detail::deepest_subtype_recursive&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;();
        }
        else {
            return declval&lt;subtype&lt;T&gt;&gt;();
        }
    }
}

this works, but it doesn't seem like a very clean solution to me.

Is there a clean way to declval? like maybe there is a utility like that already, or a utility that fully constructs a passed object.
Or am I supposed to abandon returning values and rather make the logic with only types, therefore using statements?
","c++, c++20, constexpr, typetraits",1,73134425,"You can return std::type_identity&lt;T&gt;{} (which is always default-constructible) and use decltype()::type to get the wrapped type.

tags = &quot;/yellow=flower/blue=sky&quot;

What would be the regex pattern to yield this information?
I have tried:

pattern = &quot;^[A-Za-z0-9]{1}^[A-Za-z0-9]{1}&quot;

","python, python-3.x, regex, data-structures, pattern-matching",-1,74261837,"Your attempt has several issues:

It doesn't attempt to match /, nor =
^ will (by default) match the start of the input, so having it in the middle of your regex pattern is a guarantee of having no matches. Moreover, you want to match pairs that are not at the start of your input, so there really shouldn't be a ^ in your pattern.
{1} tells the regex engine that the preceding pattern should be matched exactly once. This is never necessary to include, since that is the default. Secondly, it doesn't do what you want: you don't want to say that an identifier like &quot;yellow&quot; can consist of only one character. On the contrary, you want to allow multiple characters, and the way to indicate that is with a +.
Less of an issue, but [A-Za-z0-9] is almost the same as the much shorter \w. The only difference is that the latter also allows for an underscore character, which I think would be fine. In most contexts identifiers are allowed to include underscores. So use \w instead. To make sure backslashes are passed on as-is to the regex engine, prefix your string literal with r
The desired output seems a multiline string. But that is not very handy to work with. You'd want to get a list of pairs, or possibly a dictionary with key/value pairs.

With the above points taken into account, your code would become:
import re

linein = &quot;/yellow=flower/blue=sky&quot;
pattern = r&quot;/(\w+)=(\w+)&quot;
lst = re.findall(pattern, linein)
print(lst)  # [('yellow', 'flower'), ('blue', 'sky')]

","angular, dictionary, testing, jasmine, pipe",1,72856252,"Multiple issues here. You actually have to subscribe to this.parents$ to execute the map, which makes your test async. In your test, you're subscribing on the result of parentsM(), which I guess doesn't return exactly this.parents$, so you're not subscribing to the pipe you wrote. You may also use waitForAsync instead of async.
Please try this:
it(&quot;getParents with siteId&quot;, waitForAsync(() =&gt; { // &lt;== waitForAsync

is there any way to force GS not to replace font if it wasn't found on the system?
why is it replacing ArialMT with NimbusSans-Regular even though I have declared a specific path to ArialMT in my FontMap.GS file?

73630660,PySimpleGUI Combo: Bind key/value pair array or get selected index?,"I'm really astounded that there doesn't seem to be a way to bind a dictionary or key/value pair array to a simple dropdownlist that the Combo element is supposed to cover. The contents of a given Combo in my app is fetched from the database and I would like to know the primary key of any item that is selected from said Combo. However, it only seems possible to populate the Combo with a list of strings, so everytime I tried to &quot;get&quot; the item, the name string is all I've got left.
A temporary workaround where I fetch the source item from the database based on the name string is tenuous at best, as there's no guarantee that I'm getting the actual item and not some alternative that happens to have the same name. Also, it would be unneccesary to do another database trip, when you've already just fetched all the items!
A more reliable workaround where I keep the table rows in memory and then look up the row using the selected index, also falls short, because, in contrast with pysimplegui's Listbox element, you cannot get the selected item's index of a Combo!!!
What gives!? I'm about to completely give up on PySimpleGUI in favour of a (hopefully) better alternative. If you know of any, I would regard that as an answer to my question also.

Yes you can; however, the code you provided does not use locals.
Local usage would be:

73518721,Set item opacity in RecyclerView depending if item is in center,"I want to display items in a horizontal list using RecyclerView. At a time, only 3 items will be displayed. 1 in the middle and the other 2 on the side, below is an image of what I'm trying to achieve:

I'm using LinearSnapHelper which centers an item all of the time. When an item is moved away from the center I would like the opacity to progessively change from 1f to 0.5f.
Here is the below code which I've written to help:
class CustomRecyclerView(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : RecyclerView(context, attrs) {
    
    private var itemBoundsRect: Rect? = null

    init {
        itemBoundsRect = Rect()
        addOnScrollListener(object : OnScrollListener() {
            override fun onScrolled(recyclerView: RecyclerView, dx: Int, dy: Int) {
                super.onScrolled(recyclerView, dx, dy)
                calculateVisibility()
            }
        })
    }

    private fun calculateVisibility() {
        val linearLayoutManger: LinearLayoutManager = layoutManager as LinearLayoutManager
        val firstVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()
        val lastVisibleItem = linearLayoutManger.findLastVisibleItemPosition()
        var indexes: MutableList&lt;Int&gt; = mutableListOf()
        for (i in firstVisibleItem..lastVisibleItem) {
            indexes.add(i)
            val item: View = layoutManager?.findViewByPosition(i) ?: continue
            item.getGlobalVisibleRect(itemBoundsRect)
            var itemSize = layoutManager!!.findViewByPosition(i)!!.width
            
            var visibleSize = 0
            if (indexes.size == 1) {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right
            } else {
                visibleSize = itemBoundsRect!!.right - itemBoundsRect!!.left
            }



            var visibilty = visibleSize * 100 / itemSize
            if (visibilty &gt; 0) {
                visibilty = 100 - visibilty
            }

            val viewHolder = findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(i)
            viewHolder!!.itemView.alpha = (100 - visibilty).toFloat() / 100f
        }
    }
}

It doesn't work as expected as the opacity changes at the wrong time. The image below demonstrates this better. I expect the opacity to progressively begin to change when the item edges come out of the red box. However, it only starts when the item reaches the yellow edges.

Is there a way to achieve this effect?
Thank you :)
","android, kotlin, android-recyclerview, android-animation",1,73519659,"Your code for calculateVisibility() is looking at global position when looking at the relative position within the RecyclerView is sufficient. Maybe there is more to the code than you posted, but try the following.

For instance, for high-speed control messages, a 20 ms response may be expected. Reordering any buffered messages may be necessary to accomplish the faster response. There is no restriction on minimum response time.
Time between packets of a multipacket message directed to a specific destination is 0 to 200 ms. This means that backto-back messages can occur and they may contain the same identifier. The CTS mechanism can be used to assure a
given time spacing between packets. The required time interval between packets of a Multipacket Broadcast message is 50 to 200 ms. A minimum time of 50 ms assures the responder has time to pull the message from the CAN hardware.
The responder shall use a timeout of 250 ms (provides margin allowing for the maximum spacing of 200 ms).

","android, alarmmanager, android-alarms",1,73587758,"As part of the other work being done by whatever notificationAlarmIntent invokes, have it also call setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() for the next time you want to get control.
For example, you can put your setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() code in a utility function:

73750333,"How to call onchange from python xml rpc, for Odoo 15?","Hello I want to update a MO product_qty field, but keep all the related records (picking/transfers)
synched.
If I write to the record the product_qty gets updated, but not the related record. When doing this manually it works as intended.
I have tried the following, with no success.
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', 'onchange', [1223,{'product_qty': 10}])

","python, odoo",0,73755789,"The best thing to do here is more to check in the code what functions are called that have an @api.onchage with at least product_qty in it.
By quick looking in the model with _name = 'mrp.production', I can see 3 of them. Perhaps some other classes that '_inherit' from it can add some, to be verified.
So try this :
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_product_qty', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_raw', [[1223]])
update = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,'mrp.production', '_onchange_move_finished', [[1223]])

There is also the possibility (a bit more rare but exists) that another model has an onchange on its production_id.product_qty e.g.
Looking at relevant models with the Regex Search @api\.onchange.*'product_qty' in both Odoo and Enterprise (if used) can be a good idea ;)
Hope it helps !

There are challenges I'm facing and didn't get to solve right now:

If there is no corresponding timeframe-match it should show null in the corresponding row
It can happen both ways that there are two or more timeframes that can fall into the timeframe of the other table and vice versa.
It occurs, that different ID's appear in table two, related to one firstID

By forcing the browser used in selenium to go through a HTTP proxy, allowing the proxy to capture details about the protocol &amp; raw content, while still giving access to the browser handling of dynamic content. The most prominent seems to be selenium-wire: https://pypi.org/project/selenium-wire/

There are a few things wrong with this:

Opening &lt;p&gt; with no &lt;/p&gt; (closing tag) anywhere
&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt; nested inside of an existing form isn't allowed and will cause submission issues (see &quot;Permitted content&quot; at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
The closing &lt;/form&gt; that exists matches the &lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;, but you're missing a &lt;/form&gt;

        Button{

            }

    }

I couldn't get it to work in an acceptable time period, so I just created a second view:
struct MyBoundedButton: View {
    
    @Binding var text: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Button{
            HStack {

            }   
        }
    }
}

This obviously works, but doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution. I tried to figure out how the SwiftUI framework does it, since there are plenty of examples of views which have very different initialisers (see the SwiftUI Button for instance). I still want to figure out how this might work, so since after work I'm trying to play around with generic view, but can't really get it to work. The following code doesn't work and is just to demonstrate the line of thinking I'm following:
struct MyButton&lt;T&gt;: View {
        
        var text: T
        
        var body: some View {
            Button{
                HStack {
                    Text(text)
                }   
            }
        }
    }

extension MyButton where text == Binding&lt;String&gt;{
    init(text: Binding&lt;String&gt;)
}

extension MyButton where text == String{
    init(text: String)
}

Does someone have an idea how this could be implemented or how Apple does this in their SwiftUI library?

    }

Although the binding in this case doesn't make much sense... binding is when you are changing the value of the variable and want to pass UP to the ParentView, a binding inside a Text(text) that will never change doesn't make sense to me, but this is how you done with multiple initializers.

73195147,Converting shift-jis encoded file to to utf-8 in c++,"I am trying with below code to convert from shift-jis file to utf-8, but when we open the output file it has corrupted characters, looks like something is missed out here, any thoughts?
// From file
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(&quot;rb&quot;));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);

// convert multibyte to  wide char
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

wstring str(pUTF16);

// convert wide char to multi byte utf-8 before writing to a file
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out);
string result = string();
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0));
char* ptr = &amp;result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, str.c_str(), -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File &lt;&lt; result;

File.close();

","c++, winapi, visual-c++, character-encoding, shift-jis",1,73196580,"There are multiple problems.
The first problem is that when you are writing the output file, you need to set it to binary for the same reason you need to do so when reading the input.
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);

The second problem is that when you are reading the input file, you are only reading the bytes of the input stream and treat them like a string. However, those bytes do not have a terminating null character. If you call MultiByteToWideChar with a -1 length, it infers the input string length from the terminating null character, which is missing in your case. That means both utf16size and the contents of  pUTF16 are already wrong. Add it manually after reading the file:
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

The last problem is that you are using CP_ACP. That means &quot;the current code page&quot;. In your question, you were specifically asking how to convert Shift-JIS. The code page Windows uses for its closes equivalent to what is commonly called &quot;Shift-JIS&quot; is 932 (you can look that up on wikipedia for example). So use 932 instead of CP_ACP:
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

Additionally, there is no reason to create wstring str(pUTF16). Just use pUTF16 directly in the WideCharToMultiByte calls.
Also, I'm not sure how kosher char *ptr = &amp;result[0] is. I personally would not create a string specifically as a buffer for this.
Here is the corrected code. I would personally not write it this way, but I don't want to impose my coding ideology on you, so I made only the changes necessary to fix it:
// From file
FILE* shiftJisFile = _tfopen(lpszShiftJs, _T(&quot;rb&quot;));
int nLen = _filelength(fileno(shiftJisFile));
LPSTR lpszBuf = new char[nLen+1];
fread(lpszBuf, 1, nLen, shiftJisFile);
lpszBuf[nLen] = 0;

// convert multibyte to  wide char
int utf16size = ::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, 0, 0);
LPWSTR pUTF16 = new WCHAR[utf16size];
::MultiByteToWideChar(932, 0, lpszBuf, -1, pUTF16, utf16size);

// convert wide char to multi byte utf-8 before writing to a file
fstream File(&quot;filepath&quot;, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
string result;
result.resize(WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, NULL, 0, 0, 0));
char *ptr = &amp;result[0];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, pUTF16, -1, ptr, result.size(), 0, 0);
File &lt;&lt; ptr;

File.close();

Also, you have a memory leak -- lpszBuf and pUTF16 are not cleaned up.

","python, bitwise-operators, ampersand, tilde",-3,74223613,"First you must understand what each operator does

0 &amp; 1 == False
^ - Bitwise XOR: Returns True if only one of its operands is 1. e.g.
0 ^ 1 == True
~ - Bitwise NOT: Flips the bit of its operand.
edit: As noted by Daniel Martin, In Python specifically, it flips all of the bits of an arbitrary integer. The formula would be ~x == -x - 1 e.g.
~0 == -1

}

I was suggested to leave the Entity models strictly to reflect the db structure and use a separate class to represent queryable properties of the entity:

First, instead of computed properties on the entity, the actual queryable entity is
public class TicketSummary
{
    public string TicketId { get; set; }
    public History? LatestHistory { get; set; }
}

Then, the query is composed as follows
//Includes the tables needed for the filterable properties.
var firstQuery = _context.Tickets.Include(t =&gt; t.Histories).ThenInclude(h =&gt; h.Employee);

//Creates an IQueryable&lt;TicketSummary&gt; with the latest History entity

});

//Finally apply the filters given by the user
var filteredQuery = ticketSummariesQueryable.Where(ts=&gt;ts.LatestHistory.Employee.Name == &quot;Black Canary&quot;);

This way the most recent History is stored on LatestHistory to be promptly used on queries.

What I am trying to say, Is that unless you iterate the process and fetch the POM files of the dependencies yourself, with a custom task, All you can use is gradle dependencies command to check the transitive dependencies used by your project or module.
UPDATE:
You can easily start a new gradle project by following these simple steps.

mkdir gradleExp
 cd gradleExp
gradle init  # 1.basic 1.groovy random name
update the empty build.gradle with the following

plugins {
    id 'java'
}
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation &quot;com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.4.0&quot;
}


gradle dependencies # to list all
gradle dependencies --configuration compileClasspath  # reduce output to show only Compile classpath for source set 'main'

NOTE: missing either google() or mavenCentral() will show some failure in the result shown.

",typescript,0,74500824,"I think you can access it via counterForm's elements and you need to set what kind of html element is counterForm
you can simply use it in this way :

74065917,Looking to get the frequency of an int array through a hashmap,"public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0 || k &lt;= 0) return new int[0];
    Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; freqMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    for (int currNum : nums) freqMap.put(currNum, freqMap.getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1);

I don't understand what the .getOrDefault(currNum, 0)+1); is doing, but it seems to calculate the frequency properly. I'd like some clearance on this method please and how exactly it's working.
",java,0,74066067,"
The getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue) method of Map
interface, implemented by HashMap class is used to get the value
mapped with specified key. If no value is mapped with the provided key
then the default value is returned.
Syntax: default V getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)
Parameters: This method accepts two parameters:

key: which is the key of the element whose value has to be obtained.

defaultValue: which is the default value that has to be returned, if no value is mapped with the specified key.


Return Value: This method returns value mapped with the specified key, otherwise default value is returned.

Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashmap-getordefaultkey-defaultvalue-method-in-java-with-examples/
So, by using that method, first, you're trying to get key's value from the freqMap. If you can find it in map, then you're adding 1 to it and putting it back to freqMap. So, that means that you encountered this key before. Otherwise, that method , .getOrDefault(), returns you default value, which is 0, then you're adding 1 to it since you encountered it recently. And putting that value 1 to back to map. So, in the future, when you see that key again, you'll get it's value 1 that you added to the map before, will increase it to 2, and will put it back into the map.

I use Performance Counter but it needs administration privilege which is not possible on App Service. on another hand it only works fully functional if the operation system of App Service is Windows.
Does someone know how I can get the CPU usage of my application on Azure App Service programmatically?
","c#, azure, azure-appservice",0,73622903,"For a cross platform cpu measurement use event counters:

EventCounters are .NET APIs used for lightweight, cross-platform, and near real-time performance metric collection. EventCounters were added as a cross-platform alternative to the &quot;performance counters&quot; of .NET Framework on Windows. In this article, you'll learn what EventCounters are, how to implement them, and how to consume them.
The .NET runtime and a few .NET libraries publish basic diagnostics information using EventCounters starting in .NET Core 3.0. Apart from the EventCounters that are provided by the .NET runtime, you may choose to implement your own EventCounters. EventCounters can be used to track various metrics. Learn more about them in well-known EventCounters in .NET
EventCounters live as a part of an EventSource, and are automatically pushed to listener tools on a regular basis. Like all other events on an EventSource, they can be consumed both in-proc and out-of-proc via EventListener and EventPipe. This article focuses on the cross-platform capabilities of EventCounters, and intentionally excludes PerfView and ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) - although both can be used with EventCounters.

There are several event counter provided by the .Net framework, listened here.
You can listen to these events in-proc using an EventListener. The code below shows an example implementation. The value of EventCounterIntervalSec determines the frequency in seconds of the measurements.
First, we need a hosted service that listens to the runtime event source during the lifetime of the web app process
public class CpuUsageListenerService : BackgroundService
{
    private CpuUsageListener cpuListener;

    protected override Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        cpuListener = new CpuUsageListener();

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public double LastValue =&gt; cpuListener.LastValue;
}

public sealed class CpuUsageListener : EventListener
{
    public double LastValue { get; private set; }

    protected override void OnEventSourceCreated(EventSource eventSource)
    {
        if (eventSource.Name.Equals(&quot;System.Runtime&quot;))
            EnableEvents(eventSource, EventLevel.LogAlways, EventKeywords.All, new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { &quot;EventCounterIntervalSec&quot;, &quot;1&quot; } });
    }

    protected override void OnEventWritten(EventWrittenEventArgs eventData)
    {
        if (eventData.EventName != &quot;EventCounters&quot;)
            return;

        var payload = (IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)eventData.Payload[0];
        var isCpuCounterValue = payload[&quot;Name&quot;] == &quot;cpu-usage&quot;;
        if (!isCpuCounterValue)
            return;

        LastValue = (double)payload[&quot;Mean&quot;];
        Console.WriteLine(LastValue); // Output value to console every second
    }
}

Register the service in your startup.cs:
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
            
    services.AddSingleton&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;();
    services.AddHostedService(sp =&gt; sp.GetService&lt;CpuUsageListenerService&gt;());
            
    ...
}

The, finally, in your controller you can get the last value like this:
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService;

    public ValuesController(CpuUsageListenerService cpuUsageListenerService)
    {
        this.cpuUsageListenerService = cpuUsageListenerService;
    }

    [HttpGet(&quot;/api/cpu&quot;)]
    public ActionResult&lt;double&gt; CpuUsage()
    {
        return cpuUsageListenerService.LastValue;

73410047,Displaying random RGB pixels in Python,"I am starting a little project and I am having some difficulty in finding the answer that I am looking for. I don't really know exactly what terms I should be using to search, and couldn't find anything similar so I am sorry if this has been asked previously.
I am essentially trying to have a 2D plot of a set size, 300x300 for example full of random RGB pixels. I have figured out how to plot them with imshow and remove the axis labels so far, but it looks odd like it is zoomed in too far. Also, I know I can use RGB arguements in imshow, but the matplotlib manual touches on it, but never gives any examples. The closest cmap I have found to RGB is hsv so I am using that for now until I find the RGB solution.
Can anyone help me with assigning a random RGB value to each pixel instead of using cmap, and maybe adjusting the apparent size of the image so the pixels are less &quot;zoomed in&quot;? I am open to using something other than imshow for flexibility, it is just the only thing I found to do what I want. Thank you very much in advance!

","vue.js, axios, vuejs3, vue-router",0,74363995,"Update 2
Having seen the code, I think the problem is here:
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

axios.defaults.baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

if (localStorage.getItem('user')) {
    const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${user?.accessToken}`;
}

this will read the axios.defaults.headers when the helpers/axios.js file is loaded. This is why axios.get('/users'); only works on second load, or rather only when the authentication is already loaded into localStorage. A change to the user object or a local storage will not update since this code only runs once at the beginning, the change to axios.defaults.headers needs to be dynamic.
Update
if setTimeout didn't work that could be due to a different issue. Also, if your request works a second time, but it also works if the authentication is passed directly, it seems to me that it has something to do with the authentication being handled implicitly.
I think what's happening is that you are creating multiple instances of axios and relying on shared authentication
// create single axios instance
export const api = axios.create({
   withCredentials: true,
   baseURL: BASE_URL // optional
})

// then use
await api.post('/auth/login', {
  username: username,
  password: password
});

// and 
await api.get('/users');

This might make the axios instance remember the authentication information between calls. It may still require handling race condition if you have an app that doesn't wait on the login request to finish.

I think this is just an issue with a race condition
POST:/login and GET:/users requests appear to be done in parallel.
onMounted( async () =&gt; {
  // this should wait until the `login` has been handled
  const response = await axios.get('/users');
  users.value = response.data;
})

I don't see how you call login so can't offer the the exact solution, but if you can store the login request state as a reactive variable, you can do something like
watch: {
  loginState:{
    immediate: true
    handler(value){
      if (value === LOADED) {
        const response = await axios.get('/users');
        users.value = response.data;
      }
    }
  }
})

here's what the changes to the authStore might look like
export const STATES = {
  INIT:&quot;INIT&quot;,
  PROCESSING:&quot;PROCESSING&quot;,
  ERROR:&quot;ERROR&quot;,
  LOADED:&quot;LOADED&quot;,
}
export const loginState = ref(STATES.INIT);

async login (username, password) {
    loginState.value = STATES.PROCESSING
    try{
      const response = await axios.post('/auth/login', {
        username: username,
        password: password
      });
      loginState.value = STATES.LOADED
      this.user = response.data;
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(this.user));

      await router.push('/');
    }catch(e){

But getting the data after filtering it in query may also meaningful because all the filtering is handled in database and if you have a good infrastructure, your data will come faster.

test_dict = {'opt1':['10, 20], 'opt2':[21,30]....}  

Using map to apply that did not work.
These approaches, likewise, did not work

72965331,"Async ""not expected"" result","I'm trying to understand how async works. All the examples I've seen use asyncio.sleep, but I would like to get an example without that. Below I have provided a simple example to demonstrate my confusion regarding how async/await works.
import asyncio
import time

from functools import wraps

def timing_async(f):
    @wraps(f)
    async def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.perf_counter()

        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f&quot;Async function {f.__qualname__} finished in {end - start:.2f} seconds&quot;)
        return val
    
    return inner

  
async def _simple_count(n=10000000):
    return [i for i in range(n)]

@timing_async
async def simple_count(n=100000000):
    t = await _simple_count(n)
    return t

@timing_async
async def sleep_short():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return 10


@timing_async
async def sleep_long():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    return 20

async def main():
    tasks = [sleep_long(), sleep_short(),sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

If I run the main function, I will get back:
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.11 seconds
Async function sleep_long finished in 0.20 seconds
    
[20, 10, 10]

which looks sensible, since sleep_short takes shorter time to complete. However, if I define the function:
async def main():
    tasks = [simple_count(), sleep_short(), sleep_short()]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

I will get this output:
Async function simple_count finished in 4.18 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds
Async function sleep_short finished in 0.10 seconds

which implies (?) that the simple_count coroutine is completed first, even though it is much slower to sleep_short.
I am pretty sure this is due to my misconception of how async/await works, so I would appreciate it, if you could help me understand this concept better through this example.
","python, asynchronous, async-await",0,72965870,"Asynchronous functions allow you to run concurrent tasks, i.e. coroutines, that yield control back to the caller at certain points. Concurrent execution is by no means parallelization. For the latter you'll want to use threads or processes. Since _simple_count() only performs one lengthy task without ever yielding back control to the calling function, it will block other concurrent tasks until it is done, since you literally await its result in the timing decorator's wrapper.

Try this, look at this Example Sheet

Paste this formula next to products name and drag down.

=COUNTIF(FILTER($B$2:$L$16,$B$1:$L$1=N2),TRUE)


Explanation
FILTER the range $B$2:$L$16 where the headers $L$1 = the value in range N2:N12 products, the output is TRUE and FALSE Array.
count TRUE value in the Array resulted from FILTER with COUNTIF function COUNTIFFILTER[ True / false array ], TRUE TRUE is COUNTIF criterion.

will NOT work because the language specification says that you MUST specify the type when initializing a struct's field with a composite literal value. E.g. a nested struct, or a map, or a slice, etc.

Since category's type is an unnamed composite type, to initialize the field you MUST repeat the unnamed composite type's definition.

var unit = Unit{

Exception: The parameters (String,String) don't match the method signature for CalendarApp.Calendar.createAllDayEvent.

My script is:
  var SheetApp = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();  
  var SelectedRow = SheetApp.getActiveRange().getRowIndex();
  var value = SheetApp.getRange(SelectedRow, 8).getValue(); //Name of the event

  var eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sampleemail@gmail.com&quot;);

","javascript, datetime, google-apps-script, google-calendar-api",0,73354877,"When you add a number to a Date object, the Date is automatically converted to its underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch. The result of the addition will be that number of milliseconds  plus 14, which is just a big integer. The createAllDayEvent() method expects a Date object rather than an integer.
To get a date that is 14 days from now, use Date.setDate(). This method has the benefit that it automatically takes care of rolling into the next month or next year as necessary, but be careful. The setDate() method modifies a Date object in place, but does not return the Date object. Instead, it returns the underlying value, i.e., the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
This means that you cannot just assign the result you get from setDate() to a variable in the hope of getting a valid Date. Something like const twoWeeksFromNow = new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 14) will not work if you expect twoWeeksFromNow to contain a Date.
An easy way to get it right is to use a short utility function, like this:
function testCreateAllDayEvent() {
  const twoWeeksFromNow = dateOffset_(new Date(), +14);
  const eventCal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(&quot;sample_email@gmail.com&quot;);
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();

If I dont read the request header, then the http 1.0 version will stop after a couple thousand requests.
It is also a separate issue from your original &quot;dies after the second request.&quot; which is because your are not actually using HTTP 1.1 !

I'm pointing the value of IsRefreshEmail with *bool. If I remove the pointer and I try to call my API without it, the API will throw a bad syntax error.
That will happen only if the boolean value will be false. If it's true even if you remove the pointer the API will respond correctly.
Why is this happening? It's normal? I can't understand it and i don't even know if I'm doing it wrong with the pointer. What I surely know is that if I remove the * from bool and I insert false as value in postman for the field isRefreshEmail the API will throw an exception.
Someone can explain please? Thank you.
","json, validation, go",2,73074076,"A boolean can represent two values, false or true:

A boolean pointer can represent three values, false, true or nil:

The benefit of this, is that you can compare false with nil:
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;isRefreshEmail&quot;: false}
{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;}

without the pointer, the two JSON above will be identical after Unmarshal.
Depending on your situation, you might not care about that. However if you need
to know if the value was omitted, then pointer is required.

We wanted to replace that raid with new drives since the old ones started to die. We copied all data from the raid to a new drive with the file explorer (wasn't me...), then replaced all drives and created a new raid, put back on all the old data and changed the drive letter back to the old one. Thinking that everything would work as normal.
Sadly not with postgres. The copying with file explorer destroyed all symlinks in the pg_tblspc folder. They arent symlinks anymore, they are just empty folders. So I have now 147 broken symlinks...
I checked how the symlinks working and compared to a working postgres installation. I found out that every table has an OID. For each OID there are 2 symlinks in that folder. The symlinks have an increased number.
For example, the OID of a table is 17530, then I have 2 symlinks 17538 and 17541. These pointing towards the data folder with the database name. In the folder with the database name I have 2 folders again. One of these symlinks pointing to one of these folders.
The increased numbers are always so same. So its always OID +8 and +11 (on other working installation its always +4 and +7).
All the table management is done by a program (FTK). So if you do stuff in there, its creating/deleting/updating the databases and tables for you. I think that its always 2 folders in there is because FTK is doing that in that way.
My question is now: Can I just manually create these symlinks? And then everything should work? Or is there maybe a function from postgres, where I can point to the &quot;new&quot; folder and it recreates the symlinks? It looks like the symlinks are managed by postgres itself. But so far I couldnt find anything about a repair function
","postgresql, postgresql-9.3",0,74604143,"Mistake number one was not to take a backup. Mistake number two was to create 147 tablespaces. But let's no dwell on that. What can you do?
First, facts. In the directory pg_tblspc is one symbolic link per tablespace, not per table. The name of the symbolic link is the object ID of the tablespace. You can find the object IDs with
SELECT oid, spcname FROM pg_tablespace;

Then you have to figure out what directory belong to which tablespace. There i no help for that, since that is the information that got lost. Once you know the path for a tablespace:

change to the pg_tblspc directory

run
ln -s /path/to/tablespace 12345

where 12345 is the OID of the tablespace.


Needless to say, PostgreSQL must be shut down when you do that.  Once you have re-created the symbolic links for all tablespaces, you should be good.

73583513,Get a subresource with api-platform for a User's roles in Symfony5,"In Symfony5 security Roles are plain strings. So, a User entity generally has a $roles array that stores the role name strings, for example:
class User {

  // ...
}

However, in my environment I want to enrich Roles with descriptions and other meta data, so I have a Role class, and I want to be able to fetch a list of roles for a single user using the api-platform framework (note: fetching a collection of Roles is not an issue and can be done  out-of-the-box).

73436929,Microtask as macrotask in javascript code,"I've found this note in whatwg spec:

It is possible for a microtask to be moved to a regular task queue, if, during its initial execution, it spins the event loop. This is the only case in which the source, document, and script evaluation environment settings object set of the microtask are consulted; they are ignored by the perform a microtask checkpoint algorithm.

What is an example of it, that expresses this quote? How is it possible to move a microtask from the microtask stack to the macrotask stack and perform it like a macrotask?
","javascript, event-loop",3,73439078,"This was here for showModalDialog, which used to load a document in a modal, blocking the initial document until this modal is closed... For this to happen the UA had to &quot;spin the event loop&quot; until the modal's document is closed. This &quot;spin the event loop&quot; macro does convert the microtask to a &quot;simple&quot; task.
The showModalDialog() method has been removed from the specs but this remained since it can also be used in other modals or to allow &quot;long tasks&quot; to be short circuited by the UA, so that they can update the rendering and e.g show a message to the user about the long script.
This is for instance advised in a note about pausing, called by all modals like alert(), prompt(), etc.:

Pausing is highly detrimental to the user experience, especially in scenarios where a single event loop is shared among multiple documents. User agents are encouraged to experiment with alternatives to pausing, such as spinning the event loop or even simply proceeding without any kind of suspended execution at all, insofar as it is possible to do so while preserving compatibility with existing content.

You also have that in some browsers with infinite loops, where they'll pause the script and show a message along the lines of &quot;A script on this page is taking too long, do you want to wait or kill it with fire?&quot;.
As an example, in Firefox, both cases will trigger a rendering update when the prompt is shown to the user, i.e they do spin the event loop. So if the &quot;pause&quot; was triggered from inside of a microtask, they should move it to a macrotask when it's resumed.
However IIRC, they actually use a custom version of spin the event loop that only allow for the rendering phase (without callbacks) and nothing more. And the microtask isn't really converted to a task even there.
There are active discussions, where it is planned to &quot;remove this concept&quot; of reentering microtasks, since it's actually not really used by implementers. And even if it was, I'm not sure that'd be observable to us.

I'm sure this same issue impacts CookieContainer, AutomaticDecompression, Credentials, Proxy, FollowRedirects, PreAuthenticate, RemoteCertificateValidationCallback options on the HttpClientHandler object; and MaxTimeout, UserAgent and Expect100Continue options on the HttpClient.
IMHO either: setting any of these Options after the RestClient is constructed should cascade to the underlying objects, OR the Options object should be read-only. But that is a decision for the RestSharp developers...
I have just tested my code that I changed to get the PFX certificate BEFORE creating the RestClient, and setting it in the RestClient Options object as passed into the RestClient constructor - and it worked.

73646644,default values for record properies,"If I have a Java record with 2 properties and I want to define default values for the properties which should be used instead of null. I can either override the getters

    Boolean required) {

    @Override
    public Boolean required() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }

    @Override
    public Set&lt;String&gt; strings() {
        return Objects.requireNonNullElse(this.strings, Set.of());
    }
}

Or I can achieve much the same thing by overriding the default constructor
public record MyRecord(

    Set&lt;String&gt; strings,

    Boolean required) {

    public MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
        this.strings = Objects.requireNonNullElse(strings, Set.of());
        this.required = Objects.requireNonNullElse(required, Boolean.TRUE);
    }
}

Both of these seem a bit verbose, is there a more concise way to assign default values to record properties?
","java, record",4,74069263,"Overriding the accessor methods like in your first variant violates the expectation that you can create an equal object using the accessor methods and the canonical constructor. From the documentation

For all record classes, the following invariant must hold: if a record R's components are c1, c2, ... cn, then if a record instance is copied as follows:
    R copy = new R(r.c1(), r.c2(), ..., r.cn());

then it must be the case that r.equals(copy).

But with your overridden accessor method, the following assertion fails:
MyRecord r1 = new MyRecord(null, null), r2 = new MyRecord(r1.strings(), r1.required());
assert r1.equals(r2);

because the internal fields contain different data.
So the only correct way to fix input data is during the construction, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, Boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        if(strings == null) strings = Set.of();
        if(required == null) required = true;
    }
}

However, you shouldn’t do this null handling at all. Collections should never be null and using Boolean for the constructor implies having a Boolean record component type in general, i.e. also returned by the accessor method. And writing new MyRecord(null, null) instead of new MyRecord(Set.of(), true) doesn’t even save much typing.
If you want to support default values, you should overload the constructor, e.g.
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
    public MyRecord() {
        this(Set.of(), true);
    }
}

So you can use new MyRecord() for the defaults. Or you consider that records are immutable, so constructing multiple instances of defaults isn’t necessary
public record MyRecord(Set&lt;String&gt; strings, boolean required) {
    public static final MyRecord DEFAULT = new MyRecord(Set.of(), true);
    public MyRecord {
        strings = Set.copyOf(strings); // enforce non-null immutable set
    }
}

and use MyRecord.DEFAULT whenever you need the default values. Of course, you still can provide overloaded constructors for the cases that only one parameter should have default values, if that is needed.

Sometime, there is an argument that can be a int or float or a timestamp or anything that supports comparison (larger than / smaller than) and that I can use for trimming data for instance.

The default built-in types return NotImplemented when applied to a type they can't be compared with, for example, while specialised libraries like SQLAlchemy and numpy use rich comparison methods to return completely different objects. See the documentation for the rich comparison methods for the details.
But you should be able to define a
a Protocol subclass for specific expectations:
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)

class Comparable(Protocol[T]):

        ...

    def __lt__(self: T, other: T) -&gt; bool:
        ...

    # ... etc

You may need to tweak the protocol to fit your exact expectations, and / or use a non-generic version that's specific to the types you use (perhaps with @overloaded definitions for specific types).
For sorting with the builtin sorted() function, __eq__ and __lt__ suffice.

73676116,Specify callback function in dart/flutter that accepts two possible sets of parameters,"Is there a way to create a callback function that accepts one of two different sets of parameters? Or have two separate callback functions as options, and make sure at least one of them is specified?
I have a view that I want to pass a callback function, that either includes a Goal or a title and description (which would end up being put together into a goal).
void Function({required String title, String? description}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithString;
void Function({required Goal goal}) onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal;
I want one, but not both of these callbacks to be required - if there is a function with a goal as a parameter, I'd execute that, but if not, I'd execute the one with a String title and a String description. Something like this:
if (onGoalPopupCompletionWithGoal != null) {
    // execute this callback function
} else {
    // execute onGoalPopupCompletionWithString
}

","dart, callback",0,73680911,"That's not something which can be expressed in the Dart type system.
A single function which can be called as void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}) will have a signature of:
  void Function({String title, String? description, Goal goal})

Any implementation of that type will either have to make title and goal optional, or provide them with default values.
In either case, there is no way, in the type system, to ensure that the function is always invoked as one of the original types.
Also, it'll be highly annoying to write, you'd probably be better off with two different callbacks.
You can provide two callback parameters, one of each kind, and require that at least one of them is required ... but not in the type system. You'd have to make both optional, and check at runtime that at least one was provided.
Having as single parameter which accepts either function type, that requires a union type. A union type allows either one type or another, in this case either void Function({required String title, String? description}) or void Function({required Goal goal}). Dart does not have union types in general.
If you need to pass both of these types through the same currently valid Dart type, the type needs to be a supertype of both.
The closest common supertype of those two types is Function.
(The only function types that void Function({required Goal goal}) can be assigned to are void Function({required X goal}) where X is a subtype of Goal. I guess you can also change the void to another, equivalent, top-type.
Any other function type allows its functions to be called in a way that void Function({required Goal goal}) does not.)
Dart does have one kind of type union: Classes with subclasses.
You can declare a callback class:
abstract class MyCallback {
}
class TitleCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required String title, String? description}) callback;
  TitleCallback(this.callback);
}  
class GoalCallback extends Callback {
  final void Function({required Goal goal}) callback;
  GoalCallback(this.callback);
}

I am searching for a way to unlink their margins...
","html, css, margin",0,73364473,"There is no margin, it's an issue with your form. Try this:
form{
  display:flex;

Or (but I don't recommend it):
input[type=text]{

Flex gives you much more flexibility (pun intended) and it's much easier to work with. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

73760219,Dialogflow CX - Transition to page using sentiment analysis score,"Does anyone know if it’s possible to transition to a different page solely off of a sentiment analysis score ($request.sentiment.score) of the end-user’s response?
I basically want the agent to ask the end-user a question and then have the agent route the user to a page strictly using the sentiment analysis score of the user’s response and nothing more

What I tried so far:
Through the Dialogflow-CX simulator, I am trying to transition to a different page using the conditional statement $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 in the route, however the agent does not transition to the next page and cannot match my input to the strictly conditional route (it just jumps to the sys.no-match-default event handler)
Here is a screenshot of the route I have set up:

As you can see, the route has no intents other than a conditional trigger that has $request.sentiment.score &lt;= 0 as the parameter.
I simply want the agent to direct the end-user to the next page whenever it detects a message with a negative sentiment score. The next screenshot shows that the agent detects that the sentiment score is negative, however the agent does not transition to the next page.

Does anyone know what I seem to be doing wrong?

I'm listening to only one added document in a collection.

No, you're not. You're attaching a snapshot listener to a collection and not to a single document:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

This means that you're listening for real-time updates for each operation that takes place inside the entire sub-collection called &quot;Collection&quot;.
What you're basically doing, you're saying, hey Firestore, give me all documents that exist in that sub-collection and keep the listener alive. This listener will be invoked every time a document in that collection changes over time.
If you want to listen to a single document, then you should add a call to .document() and pass a specific document ID:
db.collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(currentUid)
  .collection(&quot;Collection&quot;)
  .document(&quot;someDocumentId&quot;) //👈
  .addSnapshotListener(/* ... */)

In this way, you'll only be notified about the changes to a single document.

html2canvas and other libraries that use svg and foreign object - these just don't produce consistent results.
rendering server side with puppeteer - it would be much better if the screenshotting could be achieved client side.
using webRTC - asking for permission and having the user select a screen/window is just not very intuitive.

73300008,".NET Core Web API only gets JSON from the Mock Lambda Tool. Using Postman, Swagger & AWS Lambda fail","I recently wrote a .NET Core Web API to receive JSON from a Lambda SNS message event. The Lambda sends the SNS event message JSON (via a POST request) to the API.
When I use the 'Mock Lambda Tool' to send the SNS message to the API, all is well. It works great. The data arrives, my API's controller sees it and it sends it over to the class that parses the data sends it into a database.
So, I then published the API to IIS and tested it from the Mock Lambda Tool. That worked too.
Feeling good about the work I uploaded the Lambda to AWS (for real world scenarios), I did a quick test of the same SNS message (JSON) using the AWS Lambda console. It times out.
So, I decided to go back and try testing the API on IIS using Postman. It shows:

I'm curious if it's my Post Request that is the problem?
Why is the 'Mock Lambda Tool' the only way I can get the data over to the API?
Thanks
","c#, json, api, iis, aws-lambda",0,73312138,"UPDATE. I learned that the Lambda at AWS required a VPC to my internal VM that hosts the API on IIS. That solves why the Lambda at AWS timed out repeatedly.
As for Postman and Swagger problem, the issue is that the Mock Lambda Tool sends the entire SNS message event in its natural full format, then the Lambda extracts the Message portion only to send over to the API.
I was sending this entire SNS message event across Swagger and Postman both of which DO NOT do the work that the Lambda does which is strip just the Message portion out of the SNS event.
Once I sent only the Message portion across with Swagger and Postman, both worked.
I must give credit to my work buddy Dorian for helping me with this. Thanks! :)

maybe like this..

Should I fix it like this? It doesn't look clean though.

74354445,What does the FC field represent in the MIPS machine code for floating point compare instructions? Refer to figure below,"
Can you also tell me how to assembler behaves for values of FC=00,01,10 and 11.
When I execute the instruction on my assembler - I found FC=11. But I have no idea what it means.
","assembly, mips, machine-code, mips32, mars-simulator",0,74354638,"The 2-bit fc field and the following 4 bits, both together, are really just the 6-bit func field.
I don't know why those authors choose break this apart into two side-by-side fields as it seems to serve no particular purpose that I can see.
Further, while they break the func field in two just for those several instructions, they revert to depiction of a 6-bit func field for all other instruction descriptions.
Because of this notation, in looking for an fc field of 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, with the subsequent 4 bits being 0xc, we can also look for func field values of 0x0c, 0x1c, 0x2c, and 0x3c, some of which can be found.
A func value of 0x3c is for c.lt.s/d (with the proper opcode=0x11 and fmt=0x10/0x11 for single vs. double, of course).
A func field value of 0x0c is for round.w.s/d.
The other values, 0x1c &amp; 0x2c are not to be found in the documentation, and this sort of omission is typical of unused opcodes, so one possibility is then that these are indeed unused opcodes for the R2000.
Entering 46 00 00 3c into https://disasm.pro/ (MIPS/big-endian) yields the proper c.lt.s, and 46 00 00 0c yields the expected round.w.s, whereas ending in 1c or 2c yield no disassembly.
Another source, MIPS green sheet, offers the same answers: 0x0c is for round and 0x3c for compare, while 0x1c and 0x2c are shown as unassigned.

What would we expect the processor to do with unassigned opcodes?  It is unclear and typically unspecified in great detail.  It takes work to detect these things so designers may allow the implementation to do what is most convenient (i.e. lowest hardware effort).  Thus, unspecified can be by omission or maybe even by explicitly being defined as undefined behavior!  Possibilities for execution range from causing some kind of exception/fault (unimplemented), to decoding the instruction improperly, which might mean running an instruction of very similar encoding.

73611112,Is there way to create types like Array in typescript,"Is there a way to create type in typescript with methods that when I call these methods, they have access to the variable's value? Equals what the array, for example, which has the method find.
Example:
const arrayVar: Array = [1,2,3];

array.find(el =&gt; el === 1); 

In this case, find has access to the value of the array arrayVar without me having to pass it via a parameter to a function, for example, I wanted to create something in this way, for example:
const myVar: MyCustomType = 5;

myVar.add(2); // Nesse caso, o retorno seria 7. 

I know it can be done with classes and functions, but then I would have to pass the value of &quot;myVar&quot; as a parameter (function add (value1, value2), for example), I wanted a way to access it directly, just like the type Array does in its methods.

Let's look at the Constructor used, part of the Class:

74484753,Communication between injected class service (AppState) and components,"I want to figure out what's the best approach to send re-render requests to a component when an application wide class' (AppState pattern) property has changed.
Following this nice blog post from Chris Sainty, the third example is exactly the kind of thing I want to achieve.
Have a singleton/scoped service, AppState, with the main purpose to store session data to be consumed by several components, invoking an event action when one of it's properties changes, after getting some data from an external api for example. The component can then listen to that and call StateHasChanged() to re-render the page.
This works but I have a couple of questions about the method.

Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default? Either for the event based communication or the whole AppState service. I'd imagine this is quite a common problem and perhaps I'm missing some default functionality like @bind.

Are there any drawbacks to @implements IDisposable? I understand why
it needs to be disposed of, but why don't we need to do it when, for
instance, binding some data to an input field to essentially do the
same thing? Does the @bind attribute already handle that under the hood?

","asp.net-core, blazor",0,74485661,"
Is it the best approach for doing this or are there more appropriate
ways implemented into the language by default?

For Communication between unrelated components, we have different options:

AppState registered as Scoped/Singleton. (extra overhead of registering and disposing event).
AppState as razor file (code example is given below).
Follow MVVM pattern for storing state, but there is downside to this approach we need to inject every view model as Scoped/Singleton. (If we are re using same component multiple times then each component state will be same).

Based on the requirement you can choose the best.
Example for AppState as razor file (preserving state of counter)
App.razor will look like this:
&lt;AppState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly=&quot;@typeof(App).Assembly&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Found Context=&quot;routeData&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;PageTitle&gt;Not found&lt;/PageTitle&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout=&quot;@typeof(MainLayout)&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/AppState&gt;

and AppState.razor will look like this:
&lt;CascadingValue Value=&quot;this&quot;&gt;
    @ChildContent
&lt;/CascadingValue&gt;

@code {
    private int _count;

    [Parameter]
    public required RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }//use 'required' only if .net version is 7 &amp; above

    public int Count
    {
        get =&gt; _count; 
        set
        {
            _count = value;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }
}

and Counter.razor will look like this:
@page &quot;/counter&quot;

&lt;PageTitle&gt;Counter&lt;/PageTitle&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Counter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p role=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Current count: @State.Count&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; @onclick=&quot;IncrementCount&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

No, only an extra overhead, we need to dispose all unmanged resource manually.

&quot;NextPageLink&quot;:&quot;https://prices.azure.com:443/api/retail/prices?$skip=100&quot;,&quot;Count&quot;:100}

I wrote a Python scripts that could help me grab that NextPageLink and loop it into a function:
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd 
from timeit import default_timer as timer
from datetime import timedelta

start = timer()
NextPageLink = &quot;https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices&quot;

def GetJSON(NextPageLink):
    wjdata = requests.get(NextPageLink).json()
    df = pd.DataFrame(wjdata)
    df.to_csv(&quot;test.csv&quot;, index=False)
    if 'NextPageLink' in wjdata:
        print (timer(), wjdata['NextPageLink'])
        NextPageLink = wjdata['NextPageLink']
        return NextPageLink

GetJSON(NextPageLink) 

The script is quite simple but it just saves the first page and doesn't query the NextPageLink.
What am I doing wrong?

","java, spring-boot",0,73300995,"Jackson ObjectMapper cannot create the object, because neither default constructor exists nor any other creator is provided (e.g. @JsonCreator, @ConstructorProperties).
You also have a rate property that is not defined in the Film class, which will cause problems unless you use the @JsonIgnoreProperties annotation (possibly with ignoreUnknown attribute set to true) or configure the ObjectMapper globally (DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES). It could also be that you wanted the likes property to handle that - anyway, it should be fixed.
I've also stumbled upon lack of the jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency, but maybe your project already has it (it's required for the Java 8 classes like LocalDate).

There are different ways to solve the first problem described above, but generally you need to either provide a default constructor or define a creator for Jackson.
If you don't want to expose the default constructor, you can change the settings of the ObjectMapper (for Spring Boot read about Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder) to allow usage of private creators (setVisibility method). In Lombok there's an annotation: @NoArgsConstructor. To limit the visibility, use the access annotation attribute.
The creator can be handled by annotating the constructor with ordered argument names:
@ConstructorProperties({&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;description&quot;, &quot;releaseDate&quot;, &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;genres&quot;, &quot;mpa&quot;, &quot;likes&quot;}). It gets complicated with the Genre and Rating classes as you do not have an explicit access to their constructors. You could either create them and mark appropriately or create a lombok.config file in your project's root directory and inside the file define the property:
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties = true
This way Lombok will automatically add the @ConstructorProperties annotations to the classes.

I've created a GitHub repository with the tests for the solution - you can find it here. The lombok.config file is also included, as well as the fixed Film class.

73211933,Extending short key for AES256 (SNMPv3),"I am currently working on security of a switch that runs SNMPv3.
I am expected to code it in such a way, that any SHA (1 - 2-512) is compatible with any AES (128 - 256C).
Everything, like the algorithms alone, works pretty well. The problem is, that its been estabilished, that we are going to use SHA for key generation for both authentification and encryption.
When I want to use, let's say, SHA512 with AES256, there's no problem, since SHA has output of 64B and I need just 32B for key for AES256.
But when I want to use SHA1 with AES256, SHA1 produces only 20B, which is insufficient for the key.
I've searched the internet through and through and I found out, that it's common to use this combination (snmpget, openssl), but I havent found a single word about how are you supposed to prolong the key.
How can I extend the key from 20B to 32B so it works?
P. S.: Yes, I know SHA isn't KDF, yes, I know it's not that common to use this combination, but this is just how it is in my job assignment.
","encryption, aes, snmp, sha",2,73214218,"Here is a page discussing your exact question. In short, there is no standard way to do this (as you have already discovered), however, Cisco has adopted the approach outlined in section 2.1 of this document:

Chaining is described as follows.  First, run the password-to-key algorithm with inputs of the passphrase and engineID as described in the USM document.  This will output as many key bits as the hash algorithm used to implement the password-to-key algorithm.  Secondly, run the password-to-key algorithm again with the previous output (instead of the passphrase) and the same engineID as inputs.  Repeat this process as many times as necessary in order to generate the minimum number of key bits for the chosen privacy protocol.  The outputs of each execution are concatenated into a single string of key bits.
When this process results in more key bits than are necessary, only the most significant bits of the string should be used.
For example, if password-to-key implemented with SHA creates a 40-octet string string for use as key bits, only the first 32 octets will be used for usm3DESEDEPrivProtocol.

`
","javascript, data-structures",0,74461936,"Try using dynamic programming to solve this problem.
Basic approach:

Parse through the array one by one recursively
At every point, check if that seat can be filled in or not. At this point, you can take either one of the two options - YES or NO
If YES - increment the total count and call the same function with the next index and incremented count
If YES - call the same function with the next index and existing count
Find out the max between the two calculations and return the answer

Code will look something like this:
function hasAPerson(array, index){
    // Utility function to encapsulate all the checks while checking the next index for possible vacant seat
    if(index &gt;= array.length){
        return false;
    }
    
    else return array[index] === 1;
}

function cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index) {
  let newlyAdded = 0;

  if(index &gt;= array.length){
      return existingNumber;
  }

  if(array[index] === 1){
      return cinSeating(array, existingNumber, index, index + 1);
  }
  
  let excludeCurrentSeat = currentValue = cinSeating(array, existingNumber, leftIndex, index + 1);
  
  let includeCurrentSeat = existingNumber;
  
  //Check if last leftIndex with 1 is beyond index-2
  if(leftIndex &lt; index-2){
      
      let next = index+1;
      let nextToNext = next+1;
      
      //Check if next or next to next index has any 1
      if(!hasAPerson(array, next) &amp;&amp; !hasAPerson(array, nextToNext)){
          includeCurrentSeat = cinSeating(array, existingNumber + 1, index, index+1);
      }
  }
  
  return Math.max(currentValue, includeCurrentSeat);
}

You can call the cinSeating function with the following arguments:

input array

existing number of people (seats already booked) - basically number of 1s in the array

last left index that had 1. When we start we can pass -3 so that left check gets passed

index to process
console.log(cinSeating([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 2, -3, 0));

}

Pragma directive:
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
    }

Now the problem is that if I put the directive above to make the code parallel around the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep call (marked with the comment --1-- in the code) I get much better times (around 9.6/9.7 seconds for that code section) vs if I put it around the for marked in the code with --2-- comment, so getting the whole function code but the malloc (times 12.7/12.8 seconds).
I've executed the code 3 times for each to make sure it wasn't a fluke and with the same number of threads (6 in this case).
I'm running on my university machine which supposedly should not have any other program running at the same time as mine for the allocated resources.
The reason why I believe this behaviour is strange is that inside the pragma omp single region I expect one single thread to execute the code, so I don't think having the malloc inside or outside the region should lead to such a difference.
Also the code gives the same result and is run with the same input.
","c, openmp, timing",0,74292832,"The problem, as mentioned by @JohnBollinger in the comments, was due to the fact that when I put the pragma as below, the thread that executed the #pragma omp single region could get to the free(dep_matrix) before the other threads had ended.

#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp single
    {
        parallel_ssor_forward_sweep(n, 0, n, 0, n, 0, n, Ax, w);
    }
#else

By putting pragma inside the parallel_ssor_forward_sweep function like below, the thread executing the #pragma omp single region has to wait for the other threads at the end of the region (i.e. before the free(dep_matrix)), and so the matrix is still available when the other threads need it.

I would like to extract it and make it either a computed variable returning a view or a  function that returns a view (I dont know which is better). I want to extract it because I reuse a similar struct.
Full code in case its needed: https://github.com/charelF/RemindMeApp/blob/main/RemindMe/NotesView.swift

But there are some errors and its generally just playing around -- I have no idea what I am really doing here and need some feedback/help.

Update from comment:
So I extracted the view as follows for now
struct ExtractedView: View {
  @State private var editNoteContent: String = &quot;&quot;
  @FocusState private var editNoteIsFocused: Bool
  @State private var editNote: Note? = nil
  
  func editExistingNote(note: Note?) {

    note.content = editNoteContent
    PersistenceController.shared.save()
    editNoteContent = &quot;&quot;
    editNoteIsFocused = false
    editNote = nil
  }

But I dont understand how to call it. If I call it with ExtractedView() then the code compiles and the app runs, but it crashes when I enter this path of the app. And when I call it like this:
ExtractedView(
  editNoteContent: editNoteContent,
  editNoteIsFocused: editNoteIsFocused,
  editNote: editNote
)

Then i get lots of errors ...

    {displayMyChild &amp;&amp; &lt;MyChildCmp validationCallback={validationCallback}/&gt;}

Here if at one point displayMyChild is truthy, then made falsy, this means the component MyChildCmp will get unmounted, hence all its state will be gone.
But now, even if you didn't have that condition and rendered the MyChildCmp always you would still run into similar problem, this is because you defined MyChildCmp inside another component. When you do that, on each render of the parent component, the function MyChildCmp is recreated, and the reconciliation algorithm of react thinks you rendered a different component type on next render, so it will destroy the component instance. Move definition of that component outside the parent component.

How do I find maximum for each column without using loops?
","multidimensional-array, vector, rust, functional-programming, iterator",4,73316927,"One way to approach this functionally would be something like this:

let my_2d_vector: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt; = vec![vec![1, 4, 3], vec![3, 3, 3]];
let mut max_in_each_col = my_2d_vector[0].clone();

Currently I am using aliases to save the values, as per the docs recommendation. Is there a way to avoid deeply nesting like this?
For example,

cy.get(selector2).invoke('val').as('alias2')
cy.get(selector3).invoke('text').as('alias3')
cy.get(selector4).invoke('text').as('alias4')

",cypress,3,73001309,"When you set an alias, a property of the same name is also added to the test context.

72970327,Unity - UnityEvent<object> as parameter but pass in UnityEvent<CustomClass> not working,"Not sure if this is possible, I can get this to work if I used the explicit type but if I do it that way it will require me to define every possible type, which could be a lot.
BACKGROUND:
I'm trying to add my custom generated list of unity event actions to a target unity event. This is meant to be a generic helper function that I can use in many of my automated editor scripts.
WHAT IM DOING:
I have a function that looks like the following:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)
{
  ...
}

Then I'm trying to use it like:
UnityEventsUtil.SetUnityEvents(target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction, newEntry, true);

Where newEntry is a custom List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; object that contains all the unity events that I want to add to the target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent.
However, when I pass target.GetComponent&lt;vLadderAction&gt;().OnDoAction UnityEvent to the function I throws the following error:
Argument 1: cannot convert from 'Invector.vCharacterController.vActions.vOnActionHandle' to 'UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent&lt;object&gt;'

Like I said before I could change my above function to be:
public static void SetUnityEvents(UnityEvent&lt;vOnActionHandle&gt; targetEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false)

and it would work. However, it's no longer generic and I would need to pass in every type.
Is this possible to make something like this generic? If so how would I do that conversion?
","c#, unity3d, generics",1,72970823,"I was able to get it to work by not using UnityEvent&lt;object&gt; but instead taking advantage of the concept of generics. Helpful youtube video talking about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnjuFeHLQ2Y
So I converted my above function to be a generic:
public static void SetUnityEvents&lt;T&gt;(T unityEvent, List&lt;UnityEventEntry&gt; entries, bool removeAllListeners = false) where T : UnityEventBase
{
  ...
}

That requires that a UnityEvent gets passed to unityEvent and doesn't just take anything because all UnityEvents derive from UnityEventBase base. So this allows me to keep the original type and pass ANY type of unity event into this function. Even UnityEvents that take any number of parameters, including custom classes. Pretty awesome!

","sql, sql-server",0,73908311,"TL;DR
Create 2 INDEXes, one on Columns1-3 and the other on Columns1 &amp; 4, INCLUDE all the other columns in the table on both INDEXes, and then use a UNION ALL query instead.
Demonstration
As I mention in the comment, if you wanted to do this in a single query, without a UNION (unlike in Tim Biegeleisen's answer) then more likely you would want an INDEX on Column1, and then INCLUDE all the other columns in your table (all, because you use SELECT * and so return all the columns, even those in referenced in the WHERE).
I do think that Tim's solution would likely be better though, especially with a much larger data set, however, that too should have some INCLUDEs in it. Without those then either a scan will be performed (which isn't helpful here) or a potentially expensive key lookup.
Here's a little demonstration with a sample table and images of the query plans.
Sample data:
CREATE TABLE dbo.YourTable (Column1 char(1),
                            Column2 char(1),
                            Column3 char(1),
                            Column4 char(1),
                            Column5 int);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.YourTable
VALUES('A','B','C','D',7),
      ('A','B','C','F',9),
      ('A','B','D','Z',1),
      ('D','B','C','X',9),
      ('Z','B','C','X',7),
      ('Z','D','C','X',4),
      ('Z','B','C','Y',9);
GO

Create Tim's indexes and test:
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Notice this have 2 table scans, as there are no INCLUDEs (this is not Column5's fault, and I demonstrate this later)
Single SELECT with an INDEX on Column1, but Column5 excluded from INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4);
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


Note this too has a table scan, due to the ommission of Column5. If we add that to the INCLUDE:
CREATE INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable (Column1) INCLUDE(Column2, Column3, Column4,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.YourTable
WHERE (Column1 = 'A' AND Column2 = 'B' AND Column3 = 'C')
   OR (Column1= 'z' AND Column4 = 'X');
GO


This unfortunately still results in a scan, but of the index this time not the table. For a larger table or for different values of Column1, SQL Server may make a different decision.
Now let's just add an INCLUDE to Tim's indexes:
--Drop mine so that they definitely aren't used
DROP INDEX idx_larnu_fullinc ON dbo.YourTable; 
DROP INDEX idx_larnu ON dbo.YourTable;
CREATE INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column2, Column3) INCLUDE (Column4,Column5);
CREATE INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.yourTable (Column1, Column4) INCLUDE (Column2, Column3,Column5);
GO

SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


Hazaar! This is what we want. Also, just to confirm however that Column5 wasn't causing the scans earlier, let's drop those INDEXes and also Column5:
DROP INDEX idx1_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
DROP INDEX idx2_tim_inc ON dbo.YourTable;
ALTER TABLE dbo.YourTable DROP COLUMN Column5;
GO
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'A'
  AND Column2 = 'B'
  AND Column3 = 'C'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.yourTable
WHERE Column1 = 'z'
  AND Column4 = 'X';
GO


So, there you can see that Column5 wasn't the cause the scans

MySQL connection id grows very fast. my database server already exceeded 1 million connection IDs in 10 days.

The screenshot is when the application is running the query. The part that says &quot;unauthenticated user&quot; seems to reestablish the database connection.

This seems to cause excessive CPU usage on the database.

My opinion is that if it is a connection pool, it should be used as it is by inheriting the connection, rather than unconditionally closing and reopening the connection when returning it.
Is this behavior intentional in R2DBC? Or is it a connection pool management bug?

74328847,Detect shift + copy keystrokes in javascript,"i'd like to handle keystroke combination of shift + copy. what i am doing is checking if keystrokes shift + cmd + c are all keydown, which is effectively shift + copy.

this works but it listens to every keystroke though. is there a better way?
here's what i'm doing for basic copy keystrokes.

      console.log(&quot;copy called&quot;);

       // TODO can shift be detected at the same time as this copy event?

it'd be great to avoid listening to all possible keystrokes to detect shift + copy.
can shift be detected from copy event listener? or is there another possible solution other than using keydown ?
","javascript, keyevent",0,74328894,"The copy event does not have any keystrokes that are carried along with the event. The only way to accomplish this is to simply filter the keystrokes, as you've done in your first example.
If you want to read more into the event object that copy has, it's a ClipboardEvent
However, if you want the copy event to get the current selection, you can use the Selection API to help you see what text / nodes are selected when the user copies things.

There is differences which django library call models. Therefore, when we define models, we must avoid define attributes in __init__ functions. That makes unexpected errors.

                )

    links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links])

There is an Exception TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not callable.
(Related link).
To fix it, I can change last line like links = models.JSONField(default=[], validators=[validate_links.__get__(object)])
Eventually, to validate fields, the best way is create the functions separated from Model class which recommended by django docs and @0sVoid.

","java, list, algorithm, hashmap",1,74162853,"Basically, you have a disjointed Graph of Entities.
Therefore, you need to implement a graph traversal algorithm in order to the data of the Entities into the resulting Map.
One of the simplest algorithms commonly used for such purposes is the Depth first search.
The core idea behind this algorithm:

Maintain a Stack, containing the element that are being examined.
Search starts from the root element being pushed on the top of the stack.
Elements are being repeatedly removed from the top of the stack. And if the next element has children that haven't been yet seen, they are being pushed on the top of the stack.

Here's how the iterative implementation might look like:
public static Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; group(List&lt;Entity&gt; entities) {
    
    Map&lt;String, Entity&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

See modifying arrays in the docs and use the array_append function for that:
UPDATE user_account
SET tag_property = array_append(tag_property, $1)

If your frontend code is actually sending an array of multiple items to add, you can use
UPDATE user_account

I need to know this limit as I am building suite of web applications deployed on separate subdomains but need them to share the same session. My thought is to share the same client id and client secret with all these apps so that access_token and refresh_token can be reused.

Concrete authorization server might have their own limits. You would have to check with each vendor separately to verify the limit of redirect URIs they allow.
Maybe a better solution would be to have one app that is responsible for obtaining the tokens and then it could establish a session with all the different applications. I think having one backend responsible for handling a session is better than relying on the lifespan of an access token. In fact, access tokens are not meant as a session-carrying mechanism. They are not related to user sessions, and you should rely on other tools for that. You can still use Google to verify the identity of a user, but you should handle the session separately.

Is there a way, maybe OS-specific or not, to identify a host that is independent of whether containerization is used or not?
",docker,2,72954175,"SOLUTION:
I used the host boot time to identify the host. Windows, Linux and MAC provide ways to get this information. These methods return the boot time of the host when called from a container. This is not a completely accurate solution to my problem, since there is some possibility that the hosts were running at the same time, but this probability is small enough to be neglected.

To verify something was working, I created this snippet:

this.container = cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, containerId);

// This code worked and I verified results in data explorer
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deleteme&quot;);

After playing with this for a bit.  I am encountering behavior I would not normally expect to see.  A bit of boring background:

I am doing TDD with a unit test project for a .NET 6 library

Class has a constructor and a single async method

This TEST code in the constructor works:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
deltest.DeleteContainerAsync().Wait();

This TEST code in the async method exits the unit test project debug mode instantly:
var deltest = this.cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, &quot;deletetesttwo&quot;);
await deltest.DeleteContainerAsync();

Following test case fails because I was expecting to have the productId populated in the ProductLine object but it is not. Is this the expected behavior of Spring Data JDBC?

Yes, if you want a productId you have to (and can easily) populate it yourself using plain Java code.
But you really shouldn't need the productId in the first place since if you follow Domain Driven Design, you will access a ProductLine exclusively from a Product which already has the id at hand.
The article https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/22/spring-data-jdbc-how-do-i-make-bidirectional-relationships might be helpful.

If I change Set&lt;ProductLine&gt; to List&lt;ProductLine&gt;, it fails due to JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException, which means the product id set to 0 as seen in the log snippet below.

You have two problems here:

You already have two sources for the product_id field: The relation from the aggregate root and the simple field, which may cause problems.

You mapped both the back reference to the aggregate root idColumn and the index of the list keyColumn to the same database column. Together with the simple field from above these are three values all mapped to the same column. Not good.
The value that seems to win is the list index, resulting in the exception.
In order to fix that, create an additional column in the product_line table and map the list index to it.

  // In reality, this would do some auditing, check for concurrency issues, and
  // attempt to save the changes. It would return unit if all went OK,

  // In reality we would have more parameters, create a device, etc before
  // calling SaveChangesAsyncEither

        _ =&gt; Left(DeviceApiResponseStates.Nah));

enum DeviceApiResponseStates {
  OK,
  Nah
}

Those three code blocks are a complete sample of my problem.
I would expect that if I call CreateDevice(&quot;jim&quot;), then I would get a Left with a value of Nah, and if I call it with any other string value, I would get a Right with a value of OK.

like this i can access layer.path but how can i do it for path drawn in draw(Rect:) method ?
","swift, uiview, core-graphics, calayer, uibezierpath",0,73545767,"Depending on what you're actually trying to do, overriding draw(_:) may not be the best approach.
For example, if you want to animate the drawn paths, it will be much easier if you are using CAShapeLayer as sublayers, or using subviews.
Also, shape layers are highly optimized ... if you write your own draw / animate functions you risk ending up with lesser-optimized code.
However, whichever approach you take, to &quot;find the path&quot; you want to use contains(_ point: CGPoint)
For example, if you have an array of UIBezierPath, with all paths relative to the top-left (0,0) of the view, on touch you could do:
// find a path that contains the touch point
if let touchedPath = bezierPaths.first(where: {$0.contains(point)}) {
    // do something with that path
}

If the paths are not relative to the top-left of the view - for example, if the path is relative to the layer position, or is part of a subview - you'd need to convert the touch point.
Here's a quick example that looks like this - on load, and then after dragging a few shapes around:
 
We'll start with a simple &quot;path&quot; struct, which contains the bezier path and the color to use. We could add various other properties, such as line width, dash pattern, etc:
struct MyPath {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

then we'll use this UIView subclass that will handle the drawing, as well as touches began/moved/ended:
class BezDrawView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            setNeedsDisplay()
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        super.draw(rect)
        
        if myPaths.count &gt; 0 {
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                p.color.set()
                p.path.stroke()
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            self.activePath = touchedPath
            self.startPoint = point
            return
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        startPoint = point
        // this triggers draw(_:)
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // done dragging
        activePath = nil
    }
    
}

and an example controller which defines some sample shapes (paths):
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
        
        let testBezDrawView = BezDrawView()
        testBezDrawView.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 0.1, alpha: 1.0)
        testBezDrawView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.addSubview(testBezDrawView)
        
        let g = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            
            // constrain bez draw view to all 4 sides with 20-points &quot;padding&quot;

        // add some sample path shapes and colors
        let colors: [UIColor] = [

        var i: Int = 0
        for (c, r) in zip(colors, rects) {
            var b = UIBezierPath()
            switch i % 4 {
            case 1:     // oval
                b = UIBezierPath(ovalIn: r)

    }
    
}

Here's a video of it in use (too big to convert to gif and embed here):

Edit in response to comment...
That needs very few changes to make it work with shape layers instead of draw(_:).
We can use the same Translation Transform to &quot;move&quot; the path, then update the .path property of that path's associated layer:
    let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
    active.path.apply(tr)
    activeLayer.path = activeParh.path.cgPath

I strongly, strongly recommend that you try to convert that sample code to shape layers on your own - it would be a good learning exercise.
But, if you run into trouble, here's a modified version...
First, we're going to use the. array index of the MyPath object to match with the sublayer index, so we need to make our struct Equatable:
struct MyPath: Equatable {
    var color: UIColor = .white
    var path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath()
}

Then some minor changes to BezDrawView -- which we'll name BezLayerView:
class BezLayerView: UIView {
    
    var myPaths: [MyPath] = [] {
        didSet {
            // remove any existing layers
            if let subs = layer.sublayers {
                subs.forEach { lay in
                    lay.removeFromSuperlayer()
                }
            }
            // create layers for paths
            myPaths.forEach { p in
                let lay = CAShapeLayer()
                lay.lineWidth = 4
                lay.lineCap = .round
                lay.lineJoin = .round
                lay.lineDashPattern = [5, 10]
                lay.fillColor = UIColor.clear.cgColor
                lay.strokeColor = p.color.cgColor
                lay.path = p.path.cgPath
                layer.addSublayer(lay)
            }
        }
    }
    
    // used to track path to move
    var activeLayer: CAShapeLayer?
    var activePath: MyPath?
    var startPoint: CGPoint = .zero
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let t = touches.first, let subs = layer.sublayers else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // find a path that contains the touch point
        if let touchedPath = myPaths.first(where: {$0.path.contains(point)}) {
            // find the layer associated with that path
            if let idx = myPaths.firstIndex(of: touchedPath) {
                if let lay = subs[idx] as? CAShapeLayer {
                    self.activePath = touchedPath
                    self.activeLayer = lay
                    self.startPoint = point
                }
            }
        }
    }
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let lay = activeLayer, let ap = activePath, let t = touches.first else { return }
        let point = t.location(in: self)
        // move the path by the distance the touch moved
        let tr = CGAffineTransform(translationX: point.x - startPoint.x, y: point.y - startPoint.y)
        ap.path.apply(tr)
        lay.path = ap.path.cgPath
        startPoint = point
    }
    override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // done dragging
        activeLayer = nil
        activePath = nil
    }
    
}

and an almost identical version of the controller:
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
        
        let testBezLayerView = BezLayerView()
        testBezLayerView.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 0.1, alpha: 1.0)
        testBezLayerView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.addSubview(testBezLayerView)
        
        let g = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([

        var somePaths: [MyPath] = []
        var i: Int = 0
        for (c, r) in zip(colors, rects) {
            var b = UIBezierPath()
            switch i % 4 {
            case 1:     // oval
                b = UIBezierPath(ovalIn: r)
            case 2:     // triangle shape

                b = UIBezierPath()
                b.move(to: CGPoint(x: r.minX, y: r.midY))

            i += 1
        }
        testBezLayerView.myPaths = somePaths
    }
    
}

The output and functionality should be indistinguishable from the BezDrawView implementation.

should do the trick. If not you can try to add the encoding standard like
f = open(os.path.join(sample_img_dir, img), &quot;rb&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)

But I'm not sure if this even works with bytes, it might only work for &quot;r&quot;.
You should give the file also a name:
sample_img = File(f, img)

If you already have the model created you can slo save the file afterwards with:
phrase = Phrase.objects.get(pk=1)
phrase.upload_to.save(img, content=sample_img))

you can faster create a new entry with the following command:

One last observation: Since the classes are using annotations to guarantee &quot;not null&quot; objects and for decimal values to have a minimum value of 0.0, my assumption is that the use of Optional is really not needed. All subcomponents of CartEntry appear to be automatically created with a value of 0.0. If that assumption is correct, the above function should work perfectly as is. If the assumption is incorrect, then it will be required to  use Optional.of() and then return 0.0 for null decimal values.

","python, google-cloud-platform",0,73545301,"I encourage you to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).
See this Python example.
ADCs means your code is unchanged whether you run it locally or on Google Cloud.
When you test your code off Google Cloud, you can export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json and ADC will use the exported credentials.
When you deploy your code to Google Cloud, ADC obtains the credentials (for the resource that's running the code) from Google's Metadata service.
For example, when you run ADC code on Compute Engine, ADC will obtain the instance's (!) Service Account.
You should try to always use instance|role-specific Service Accounts but the default Compute Engine account is a Service Account too and will work.
Be aware that you'll need to ensure that whatever Service Account(s) is/are used have the correct IAM permissions to access other services.

74204364,Is it OK to use Django development server for single-user applications?,"I'm developing an application that controls some piece of complex hardware and exposes a front-end to the users using Django, mainly for cross-platform and remote access reasons. Currently using Django templates, but soon with a separate front-end through DRF calls. My main points of interest are:

user management. Admin users have more access
session management. Ideally, one cannot login from multiple IPs at the same time.
web-socket support for asynchronous notifications and real-time monitoring.
asynchronous background operations. e.g. with celery workers

Note that the users of these application are the hardware operators which are usually no more than 3-5 tops, and most of the times, only one of them is actively working on it so no real user concurrency, neither real need to scale.

Instead of mapping over keyof T (which could lead to non-keyable types), we map over Keys. And through the constraint T extends Record&lt;Keys, string&gt;, TypeScript knows that every key of Keys must lead to a string type.

You could also just intersect it with a string.
type makeSortOptions&lt;T extends Record&lt;&quot;albums&quot; | &quot;tracks&quot;, string&gt;&gt; = {

73235410,How do server programs work on Docker when *only* the listening port is mapped to the Docker host?,"This is just a conceptual question that I have been thinking about recently.
Say I'm running an Nginx container on Docker on a host. Normally, for this to work, we have to map ports like 80 and 443 to host container. This is because these are listening ports, and connections from the outside world to port 80 should be forwarded to port 80 of the container. So far so good.
But also: port 80 is just the listening socket, right? The listening socket only accepts the connection; after this any communication done between a client and the Nginx server is supposedly done on a different socket with a random port number (on the server side). This is to allow multiple connections, and to keep the listening port free to establish more connections, etc. This is where my issue comes in.
Say I'm a client and I connect to this Nginx server. As far as I understand, I first send TCP packets to port 80 of the host that is hosting this Nginx Docker container. But during the establishment of the connection, the server changes their port to another number, say 45670. (Not sure how, but I am guessing the packets that are sent back suddenly mention this port, and our client will continue the rest of the exchange with this port number instead).
But now as I send packets (e.g. HTTP requests) to the host on port 45670, how will the Nginx docker container see those packets?
I am struggling to understand how server processes can run on Docker with only one port exposed / published for mapping.
Thanks!

Nope. When a connection is established, the client side is a random port number (usually) and the server side is the same port that the server listens on.
In TCP there aren't actually listening sockets - they're an operating system thing - and a connection is identified by the combination of both the port numbers and both the IP addresses. The client sends a SYN (&quot;new connection please&quot;) from its port 49621 (for example) to port 80 on the server; the server sends a SYN/ACK (&quot;okay&quot;) from its port 80 to port 49621 on the client.

74433987,python concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor crashing with full RAM,"Python concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor crashing with full RAM
Program description
Hi, I've got a computationally heavy function which I want to run in parallel. The function is a test that accepts as inputs:

a DataFrame to test on
parameters based on which the calculations will be ran.

The return value is a short list of calculation results.
I want to run the same function in a for loop with different parameters and the same input DataFrame, basically run a brute-force to find optimal parameters for my problem.
The code I've written
I currently am running the code concurrently with ProcessPoolExecutor from the module concurrent.futures.
import concurrent.futures
from itertools import repeat
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]
large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for future in executor.map(func, repeat(large_df.copy()), parameters):
        test_result = future.result()
        ...

The problem
The problem I face is that I need to run a large amount of iterations, but my program crashes almost instantly.
In on order for it not to crash, I need to limit it to max 4 workers, which is 1/4 of my CPU resources.
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    ...

I figured out my program crashes due to a full RAM (16 GB). What I found weird is that when I was running it on more workers, it was gradually eating more and more RAM, which it never released, until it crashed.
Instead of passing a copy of the DataFrame, I tried to pass the file path, but apart of slowing down my program, it didn't change anything.
Do you have any idea of why that problem occurs and how to solve it?
","python, multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, process-pool",1,74450459,"See my comment on what map actually returns.
This answer is relevant according to how large your parameters list is, i.e. how many total tasks are being placed on the multiprocessing pool's task queue:
You are currently creating and passing a copy of your dataframe (with large_df.copy()) every time you are submitting a new task (one task for each element of parameters. One thing you can do is to initialize your pool processes once with a single copy per pool process that will be used by every task submitted and executed by the pool process.  The assumption is that the dataframe itself is not modified by my_tests.func. If it is modified and you need a copy of the original large_df for each new task, the function worker (see below) can make the copy. In this case you would need 2 * N copies (instead of just N copies) to exist simultaneously where N is the number of processes in the pool. This will save you memory if the length of parameters is greater than that since in your code a copy of the dataframe will exist either on the task queue or in a pool process's address space.
If you are running under a platform such as Linux that uses the fork method to create new processes, then each child process will inherit a copy automatcally as a global variable:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func


parameters = [
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    (arg1, arg2, arg3),
    ...
]

large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited

def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):
        ...

my_tests.func is expecting as its first argument a dataframe, but with the above change the dataframe is no longer being passed; the dataframe is now accessed as a global variable. So without modifying func, we need am adapter function, worker, that will pass to func what it is expecting. Of course, if you are able to modify func, then you can do without the adapter.
If you were running on a platform such as Windows that uses the spawn method to create new processes, then:
import concurrent.futures
import pandas as pd

from my_tests import func

def init_pool_processes(df):
    global large_df
    large_df = df


def worker(parameter):
    return func(large_df, parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # or:
    return func(large_df.copy(), parameter)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    parameters = [
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        (arg1, arg2, arg3),
        ...
    ]
    
    large_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # will be inherited
    
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(initializer=init_pool_processes, initargs=(large_df,)) as executor:
        for result in executor.map(worker, parameters):

73315006,Trying to separate bars in two overlayed bar charts in ggplot,"I am trying to create a single chart from two created bar charts to show the differences in their distribution. I have both charts merging together, and the axis labels are correct. However, I cannot figure out how to get the bars in each section to be next to each other for comparison instead of overlaying. Data for this chart are two variables within the same DF. I am relatively new to r and new to ggplot so even plotting what I have was a challenge. Please be kind and I apologize if this is a question that has been answered before.
Here is the code I am using:
Labeled &lt;- ggplot(NULL, aes(lab),position_dodge(.5)) + ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;)+
  geom_bar(aes(x=AgeFactor,fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=FdgFactor,fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5,width=.6)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(&quot;0-6months&quot;,&quot;7-12months&quot;,&quot;1-1.99&quot;,&quot;2-2.99&quot;,&quot;3-3.99&quot;,&quot;4-4.99&quot;,&quot;5-5.99&quot;,&quot;6-6.99&quot;,&quot;7-7.99&quot;,&quot;8-8.99&quot;,&quot;9-9.99&quot;,&quot;10-10.99&quot;))+
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)

and this is the graph it is creating for me:

I really appreciate any insight. This is my first time asking a question on stack too - so I am happy to edit/adjust info as needed.
","r, ggplot2",1,73316122,"The issue is that you plot from different columns of your dataset. To dodge your bars position_dodge requires a column to group the data by. To this end you could reshape your data to long format using e.g. tidyr::pivot_longer so that your two columns are stacked on top of each other and you get a new column containing the column or group names as categories.
Using some fake random example data. First I replicate your issue with this data and your code:
set.seed(123)

levels &lt;- c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)

Graph &lt;- data.frame(
  AgeFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  FdgFactor = sample(levels, 100, replace = TRUE),
  lab = 1:100
)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(NULL, aes(lab), position_dodge(.5)) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = AgeFactor, fill = &quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = FdgFactor, fill = &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;), data = Graph, alpha = 0.5, width = .6) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(&quot;0-6months&quot;, &quot;7-12months&quot;, &quot;1-1.99&quot;, &quot;2-2.99&quot;, &quot;3-3.99&quot;, &quot;4-4.99&quot;, &quot;5-5.99&quot;, &quot;6-6.99&quot;, &quot;7-7.99&quot;, &quot;8-8.99&quot;, &quot;9-9.99&quot;, &quot;10-10.99&quot;)) +
  xlab(&quot;Age&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;&quot;)


And now the fix using reshaping. Additionally I simplified your code a bit:

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

Graph_long &lt;- Graph %&gt;%
  select(AgeFactor, FdgFactor) %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(c(AgeFactor, FdgFactor))
  
ggplot(Graph_long, aes(x = value, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.6, position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(&quot;Age of Autism Diagnosis&quot;, &quot;Feeding Challenge Onset&quot;)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = levels) +
  labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = &quot;Figure 1. Comparison of Distribution of Age of Diagnosis and Age of Feeding Challenges&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

I was thinking of able to parse a string raw bytes (needle) inside a bigger string of raw bytes(haystack). Like trying to find a particular raw byte pattern inside a blob of raw bytes read from C's read function.
",c,0,73186122,"There is the case you mention: raw binary data.
This is because raw binary data may contain zeroes, which are interpreted and string terminator by strstr, making it ignore the rest of the haystack or needle.
Additionally, if the raw binary data contains no zero bytes, and you don't have a valid (inside the same array or buffer allocation) extra zero after the binary data, then strstr will happily go beyond the data and cause Undefined Behavior via buffer overflow.

Or, to the point: strstr can't be used if the data is not strings. memmem doesn't have this limitation.

73102008,How to convert a dictionary with a tuple inside of a nested list?,"I'm trying to create a bigram from a dictionary with a specific condition. Below is the example of the dictionary:
dict_example = {'keywords1': ['africa',
  'basic service',
  'class',
  'develop country',
  'disadvantage',
  'economic resource',
  'social protection system']

The specific condition is that I want to create a bigram if the words in each element are more than 1. Below is the code that I have been working on so far:
keywords_bigram_temp = {}
keywords_bigram = {}
for k, v in dict_example.items():
    keywords_bigram_temp.update({k: [word_tokenize(w) for w in v]})
    for k2, v2 in keywords_bigram_temp.items():
        keywords_bigram.update({k2: [list(nltk.bigrams(v3)) for v3 in v2 if len(v3) &gt; 1]})

This code works, but instead of returning a normal tuple within a list (I think this is what bigram normally looked like), it returns a tuple within a nested list. Below is an example of the result:
'keywords1': [[('basic', 'service')],
  [('develop', 'country')],
  [('economic', 'resource')],
  [('social', 'protection'),
   ('social', 'system'),
   ('protection', 'system'),
   ('social', 'protection')]}

What I need is a normal bigram structure, a tuple within a list like so:
'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'),
  ('develop', 'country'),
  ('economic', 'resource'),
  ('social', 'protection'),
  ('protection', 'system')]}

","python, nltk",1,73102177,"Here's a way to do what your question asks using itertools.combinations():
from itertools import combinations
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2)]}

Output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('social', 'system'), ('protection', 'system')]}

Explanation:

in the dict comprehension, use for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if ' ' in elem to iterate over all items in the list associated with keywords1 that contain a ' ' character, meaning the words in the element number more than 1
use the nested loop for x in combinations(elem.split(), 2) to include every unique combination of 2 words within the multi-word item

UPDATE:
Based on OP's clarification that original question contained an extra entry,  and that what is required is &quot;in a 'a b c d' context, it will become ('a','b'),('b','c'),('c','d')&quot;, here are three alternative solutions.
Solution #1 using walrus operator := and dict comprehension:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': [x for elem in dict_example['keywords1'] if len(words := elem.split()) &gt; 1 for x in zip(words, words[1:])]}

Solution #2 using a long-hand for loop:
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        keywords_bigram['keywords1'].extend(zip(words, words[1:]))

Solution #3 without zip():
keywords_bigram = {'keywords1': []}
for elem in dict_example['keywords1']:
    words = elem.split()
    if len(words) &gt; 1:
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            keywords_bigram['keywords1'].append(tuple(words[i:i+2]))

All three solutions give identical output:
{'keywords1': [('basic', 'service'), ('develop', 'country'), ('economic', 'resource'), ('social', 'protection'), ('protection', 'system')]}

73690166,Can you generate a scene graph after a plant has been finalized?,"I'm working on a project that requires me to add a model through Parser (which requires the plant to be of the same type as the array used) before Setting the position of the model in said plant and taking distance queries. These queries only work when the query object generated from the scene graph is of type float.
I've run into a problem where setting the position doesn't work due to the array being used being of type AutoDiff. A possible solution would then be converting the plant of type float to Autodiff with plant.ToAutoDiff(), but this only creates a copy of the plant without coupling it to the scene graph (and in turn the query object) from which the queries are derived. Taking queries with a query object generated from the original plant would then fail to reflect the new position passed to the AutoDiff copy.
Is there a way to create a new scene graph from the already finalized symbolic copy of the original plant, so that I can perform the queries with it?
",drake,0,73690443,"A couple of thoughts:

Don't just convert the plant to autodiff. Convert the whole diagram. That will give you a converted, connected network.
You're stuck with the current workflow. Presumably, your proximity geometries are specified in your parsed file (as &lt;collision&gt; tags). The parsing process is ephemeral. The declaration is consumed, passed through MultibodyPlant into SceneGraph. If there is no SceneGraph at parse time, all knowledge of the declared collision geometry is forgotten.

So, the typical workflow is:

Create a float-valued diagram.
Scalar convert it to an AutoDiff-valued diagram.
Keep both around to serve the different roles.

We don't have a tutorial that directly shows scalar converting an entire diagram, but it's akin to what is shown in this MultibodyPlant-specific tutorial. Just call ToScalarType() on the Diagram root.

","haskell, functional-programming, f#, type-systems",2,73390341,"My previous answer explains what Value Restriction is and why it happens. But now your next question is: ok, so what do I do about it?
As the error message itself suggests, there are two possible ways: (1) give it explicit arguments or (2) if you don't want it to be generic, add a type annotation.
1. Explicit arguments
let flippedPipe x = flip (|&gt;) x

Even though logically this is the same as let flippedPipe = flip (|&gt;), syntactically this is now a function, not a value. And syntax is what matters for the Value Restriction.
2. A type annotation
let flippedPipe : (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int -&gt; int = flip (|&gt;)

This works because the function is no longer generic, so the Value Restriction does not apply. This is a desirable option in many circumstances, but judging by the kinds of functions you're working with here, I would assume this is not what you wanted in this case.
3. Explicit type parameters
The error message doesn't mention this, and in fairness, it can be considered a variation of option (2). The idea is that you can give your function explicit type parameters like this:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; = flip (|&gt;)

This makes the Value Restriction go away, because, even though it still technically applies, the fact that you added the type parameters presumably shows that you know what you're doing, so the compiler shuts up.
However, though this appears to work at first glance, it does so in the wrong way. If you look at the inferred type of this function, you'll see:
val flippedPipe : (obj -&gt; obj) -&gt; obj  -&gt; obj

This happens because, even though you added type parameters, you didn't specify exactly where they go. They may not be used at all (aka &quot;phantom types&quot;) for all the compiler knows.
So to make it work properly, this should be the definition:
let flippedPipe&lt;'a, 'b&gt; : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = flip (|&gt;)

I don't know where to start!
Any ideas?
","swift, xcode, swiftui, core-data, uiimage",0,74002169,"For your question, reason your app lost all photos everytime you refresh because it was temporary store but not save somewhere else ( internet or on local).
If you want to save it on you own server, create server side and do with api.
Come to local here, you have come to the right path finding a local which is Core Data to store. But the key point to need to know here is:

Saving image to local should use FileManager ( which means each app have the own documentary folder in your phone so save the not only image but document, files, everything else to here - It will lost only when your app is uninstalled) You just need to keep the name of the image ( you can create your own name to save image)

Code will be like this
func saveImage(imageName: String, image: UIImage) {
    // get documentary path to save image to
    guard let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first else { return }

    let fileName = imageName
    let fileURL = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent(fileName)
    guard let data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1) else { return }

    //Checks if file exists, removes it if so.
    if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: fileURL.path) {
        do {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(atPath: fileURL.path)
            print(&quot;Removed old image&quot;)
        } catch let removeError {
            print(&quot;couldn't remove file at path&quot;, removeError)
        }

    }
    
    do {
        try data.write(to: fileURL)
    } catch let error {
        print(&quot;error saving file with error&quot;, error)
    }
}

func loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String) -&gt; UIImage? {
  let documentDirectory = FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.documentDirectory

    let userDomainMask = FileManager.SearchPathDomainMask.userDomainMask
    let paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(documentDirectory, userDomainMask, true)

    if let dirPath = paths.first {
        let imageUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: dirPath).appendingPathComponent(fileName)
        let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: imageUrl.path)
        return image

    }

    return nil
}

Next is the Core Data or UserDefaults is where you save the key connect to the list of name images you save before. So everytime you come into app, just take the list image name out from the key and appear it again
I will do with UserDefaults you can try to implement the same with CoreData. I save image as name is number so I save to UserDefault only the number of images. You can change to something like you want
Code will be like this
var imageArray = [UIImage]()
var countImage = 0

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // get number of image have been saved
    let countImage = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: &quot;test&quot;)

    if countImage &lt; 1 {
        return
    }
    
    for i in 1...countImage {
        // get image from disk
        imageArray.append(self.loadImageFromDiskWith(fileName: String(i))!)
    }
    
    print(imageArray)
    self.collectionView.reloadData() // reload collection view
}

func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    let group = DispatchGroup()
    
    results.forEach { result in
        group.enter()
        result.itemProvider.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self) { reading, error in
            defer {
                group.leave()

            // add to user's photo array
            print(image)
            self.imageArray.append(image)
            // append self.countImage to 1 and save number to  UserDefault and image to FileManager
            self.countImage += 1
            UserDefaults.standard.set(self.countImage, forKey: &quot;test&quot;)

  int? id;
  String? name;
  int? status;
  DateTime? createdAt;

I'm getting my DDL successfully parsed but why I'm getting all this additional information displayed on the screen?
Is snowflake-connector and simple-ddl-parser somehow interfering with each other? Is it possible that some variables or functions are named the same or something in the simple-ddl-parser code is switching on some debug info from snowflake-connector? I have no idea... but I don't want to see this &quot;debug&quot; info on my screen but want to use simple-ddl-parser.
I will be happy to get any feedback! Thx!

You can set the DDLParser logging to CRITICAL and these messages won't appear on the screen anymore.

Fails to compile with the following error message:
error[E0658]: cannot borrow here, since the borrowed element may contain interior mutability
 13 |     if n &lt; k {

If I replace the arguments n and k with references, it compiles. Turns out, the functions in the PartialOrd are also implemented using references. So from my understanding, the expression 2 &lt; 4 will call the le function with references. For performance reasons, I doubt that's what's happening, though.
It's actually two questions that I'm asking:

Can I solve the error without using references?
Why is PartialOrd using references while Ord uses values (at least for min and max, but not for cmp)?

",rust,0,74084051,"
Adding #![feature(const_refs_to_cell)] makes it compile.
min and max take Self because they return one of the two arguments as Self. Other methods in Ord and PartialOrd else returns a bool or an Ordering so they can take by reference. if min and max they took by reference the signature would be fn max&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self, other: &amp;'a Self) -&gt; &amp;'a Self which you &quot;get for free&quot; because there is a impl&lt;A&gt; Ord for &amp;A where A: Ord.

We therefore need our customers to be able to keep SMTP Basic Authentication enabled after the 1st. October.
Question:

Will existing Office365-Tenants be able to keep SMTP with Basic Authentication enabled until Oauth 2.0 Client Credential Flow will be available for SMTP?
Is the same also true for new Tenants that are created in future? 

Thanks!

Stripe won't return 'canceled' subscriptions unless you specify 'status' =&gt; 'canceled' or 'status' =&gt; 'all' in the request. If status is omitted from the request, the response will only include non-canceled subscriptions.
You also need to pass a value for the customer parameter if you want to list a specific customer's subscription(s) only.

72863142,Git fetch does not fetch the latest commits from the remote,"I have a two-machine (Mac and Win) setup where I need to transfer changes from the Windows machine to the Mac. So I make my changes on the Win machine, commit and push them to GitHub. So far, so good. (I have confirmed that the new commits are indeed on GitHub.)
But I have recently started having a problem on the Mac that git fetch origin does not fetch the new commits from GitHub. Therefore git pull (with the branch in question checked out) tells me it is already up to date.
This repository is a submodule. I looked at the config files for the submodule on both machines, which have identical settings for remotes and for the branch. They look as follows (with account and branch names changed to generic ones).
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:upstream/myrepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    pushurl = git@github.com:personal/myrepo.git
[remote &quot;upstream&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:upstream/myrepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*

[branch &quot;mybranch-name&quot;]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/mybranch-name

My question is, does anyone know why git fetch origin from the Mac is ignoring the new commits in the remote repository? Is there a way to force it to fetch from the actual remote repository on GitHub? (Since clearly this is not currently happening.)
Currently I have partial write access to the upstream remote, which allows me to work around this problem by pushing my branch there, then pulling it into the local branch on the Mac (then pushing to origin from the Mac). But I will soon be losing write access to upstream.
If it matters, I normally use SourceTree to manage git, but in this case I have been  doing the git commands directly from the command line with no difference in behavior. I have several other submodules that are not having this problem, nor is the main repository.
","git, github",0,72863222,"The separate url and pushurl here are suspicious:

[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:upstream/myrepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    pushurl = git@github.com:personal/myrepo.git


As the git remote documentation says:

Note that the push URL and the fetch URL, even though they can be set differently, must still refer to the same place. What you pushed to the push URL should be what you would see if you immediately fetched from the fetch URL. If you are trying to fetch from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another (e.g. your publishing repository), use two separate remotes.

This caveat is, unfortunately, apparently only found in the git remote documentation; it probably should be in git fetch, git push, and git config documentation as well.
(As you've confirmed in the comments, this seems to be the basic problem, and apparently SourceTree did this for some reason known only to SourceTree.)
