To set up database encryption using the File Key Management Encryption Plugin, you will need to reach out to your hosting provider or the server administrator and request their assistance in creating the keyfile for you.

. [/INST]  Yes, it is possible to create a keyfile for MariaDB's File Key Management Encryption Plugin using PhpMyAdmin's console, without having access to the MySQL folder. Here are the steps you can follow:
1. Open PhpMyAdmin in your web browser and connect to your MariaDB server.
2. Navigate to the ""Plugins"" tab and search for ""File Key Management Encryption"" in the search bar.
3. Click on the ""Install"" button to install the plugin.
4. Once the plugin is installed, you will see a ""Key Management"" tab in the left-hand menu. Click on this tab.
5. In the ""Key Management"" tab, you will see a button called ""Create key file"". Click on this button.
6. In the ""Create key file"" form, enter a name for the key file (e.g., ""my_key_file.ppk"") and select a location to save the file. You can save the file anywhere on your system, but make sure it is accessible to the MySQL user that will be using the key to encrypt the tables.
7. Click the ""Create"" button to create the key file.
8. Once the key file is created, you can use it to encrypt your MariaDB tables using the PhpMyAdmin console. To do this, navigate to the ""Tables"" tab and select the table you want to encrypt. Then, click on the ""Encrypt"" button in the ""Actions"" menu.
9. In the ""Encrypt table"" form, select the key file you created in step 6 as the encryption key.
10. Click the ""Encrypt"" button to encrypt the table.




It's important to note that you need to have the necessary permissions to access the PhpMyAdmin console and create the key file. Also, you should make sure that the MySQL user you are using to encrypt the tables has the necessary permissions to access the key file.

    &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;esnext.full&quot;]
    }

VS Code gives a warning for esnext.full.  My understanding is that this should be valid, and should be roughly equivalent to specifying esnext along with DOM and DOM.Iterable.  How come VS Code doesn't recognize esnext.full?
","
Why isn't &quot;esnext.full&quot; recognized as a valid &quot;lib&quot; option in VS Code?

When searching for understanding, it's almost always more productive to seek the answer to questions when they're framed positively and skeptically (i.e. &quot;What does exist?&quot; / &quot;Why is x valid?&quot;) — so, in this case: &quot;Which values can be recognized?&quot; Answering this question will provide knowledge about a restrictive scope, and a foundation for the rest of the answer.
The compilerOptions.lib section in the TSConfig reference enumerates the built-in library and individual component identifiers which are valid for inclusion in a TSConfig (at the string array property compilerOptions.lib).
I won't copy the entire list here — it's very large and subject to change.
The documentation itself recognizes the fact that the allowed values do change — by the inclusion of this footnote:

This list may be out of date, you can see the full list in the TypeScript source code.

Presumably, the link pointed to a valid resource at one point in time, but as I write this answer, navigating to the resource results in a 404 response (Not Found). Perhaps the repo has been restructured since the documentation was last updated — the default branch currently does not have a top-level lib directory. However, by switching to a tag branch corresponding to a release (e.g. the v5.0.2 release from a few days ago), the top-level lib directory can be viewed:
https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/v5.0.2/lib
This is a directory of generated files (explained by the readme) — generated from data in the corresponding source directory src/lib.
So, up to this point, the best source for determining valid identifiers is &quot;consult the documentation&quot; — which, as we've seen, is not guaranteed to be up-to-date/exhaustive — and that's not even close to an acceptable answer in my opinion.
The documentation has to be derived from something, right?
Digging deeper into the source repo, we can find a module in the compiler code: src/compiler/commandLineParser.ts which contains a const array of tuples named libEntries. Here's a partial snippet for reference:
const libEntries: [string, string][] = [

  // ---snip---

  [&quot;es2023&quot;, &quot;lib.es2023.d.ts&quot;],
  [&quot;esnext&quot;, &quot;lib.esnext.d.ts&quot;],
  // Host only
  [&quot;dom&quot;, &quot;lib.dom.d.ts&quot;],
  [&quot;dom.iterable&quot;, &quot;lib.dom.iterable.d.ts&quot;],

  // ---snip---

];

This is used as the basis for valid library identifiers, and is used to create the following exports:
/**
 * An array of supported &quot;lib&quot; reference file names used to determine the order for inclusion
 * when referenced, as well as for spelling suggestions. This ensures the correct ordering for
 * overload resolution when a type declared in one lib is extended by another.
 *
 * @internal
 */
export const libs = libEntries.map(entry =&gt; entry[0]);

/**
 * A map of lib names to lib files. This map is used both for parsing the &quot;lib&quot; command line
 * option as well as for resolving lib reference directives.
 *
 * @internal
 */
export const libMap = new Map(libEntries);

This is more satisfying. If you want an authoritative list of valid identifiers for use as lib values, that's the place to view them. Be sure to consult the tag branch corresponding to the compiler version that you're using.

So now back to your question:

Why isn't &quot;esnext.full&quot; recognized as a valid &quot;lib&quot; option in VS Code?

The answer is now obviously simple: it's not recognized because it's not a valid identifier in the list.
This leads to your next question:

Why is there a library file with the .full suffix?

As you observed in a comment, TypeScript includes some declaration files internally which cannot be used in the array of library names at compilerOptions.lib in a TSConfig.
You linked to a JSON file in the source code which lists some strings in an array at a libs key — these represent partial, relative path names to internal declaration files (see src/lib). However, this is not a list of allowed library identifiers — it is simply a list for internal use by the compiler.
At the end of that list is a grouping of &quot;default libraries&quot; separated by a comment:
{
  &quot;libs&quot;: [

    // ---snip---

    // Default libraries
    &quot;es5.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2015.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2016.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2017.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2018.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2019.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2020.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2021.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2022.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2023.full&quot;,
    &quot;esnext.full&quot;
  ],

  // ---snip---
}

These values ending in the .full suffix refer to the internal declaration files which the compiler uses by default (in absence of a compilerOptions.lib array), according to the compilerOptions.target value:

Changing target also changes the default value of lib. You may “mix and match” target and lib settings as desired, but you could just set target for convenience.

Here's the utility function in the source which is used to derive the default library declaration file from the target:
src/compiler/utilitiesPublic.ts:
export function getDefaultLibFileName(options: CompilerOptions): string {
    switch (getEmitScriptTarget(options)) {
        case ScriptTarget.ESNext:
            return &quot;lib.esnext.full.d.ts&quot;;

        // ---snip---

        case ScriptTarget.ES2015:
            return &quot;lib.es6.d.ts&quot;;  // We don't use lib.es2015.full.d.ts due to breaking change.
        default:
            return &quot;lib.d.ts&quot;;
    }
}


Now, on to your final question:

What list of lib do I need to specify to get the equivalent of the default (everything pulled in by something like es2022.full), but for esnext or es2023?

You listed two ECMAScript API collections — I'll use the first one you mentioned (esnext) as the example. However, note that it's not a real spec — it refers to all &quot;bleeding edge&quot; features:

The special ESNext value refers to the highest version your version of TypeScript supports. This setting should be used with caution, since it doesn’t mean the same thing between different TypeScript versions and can make upgrades less predictable.

If you want to include the default libraries corresponding to esnext (esnext.full) in your compilation, here are two options for your TSConfig:

You can specify the libraries manually, along with your desired target:
First, in the TypeScript repo:

Navigate to the tag branch corresponding to the version of the compiler that you're using (in this example v5.0.2).

Navigate to the top-level lib directory, and find the declaration file that corresponds to your target name and ends with .full.d.ts (in this case lib.esnext.full.d.ts).


After finding the corresponding declaration file, identify all of the libraries which are referenced by triple-slash directives. I'll inline the relevant content from the file linked above:
/// &lt;reference no-default-lib=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;esnext&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;dom&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;webworker.importscripts&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;scripthost&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;dom.iterable&quot; /&gt;

In your config:

Set compilerOptions.target to your desired target (for example, I'll use &quot;es2020&quot;), and

Set the compilerOptions.lib array to the libraries identified from the previous step above.


This looks like:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es2020&quot;,
    &quot;lib&quot;: [
      &quot;esnext&quot;,
      &quot;dom&quot;,
      &quot;webworker.importscripts&quot;,
      &quot;scripthost&quot;,
      &quot;dom.iterable&quot;,
    ],

    // ---snip---
  },

  // ---snip---
}

By the way, these compiler options values are not case-sensitive.

More conveniently (if you're ok with whatever the current default behavior might be), you can let the compiler use the defaults according to your compilation target by omitting the compilerOptions.lib array:

Set compilerOptions.target to your target (in this case &quot;esnext&quot;), and

Don't define the compilerOptions.lib property at all.


This looks like:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;esnext&quot;,

    // ---snip---
  },

  // ---snip---
}

This will use the default libraries for your target (the internal esnext.full declaration file).



Finally, an observation: If you're targeting a normal browser environment, you likely don't want &quot;webworker.importscripts&quot; and &quot;scripthost&quot; which aren't part of that environment, but are included in the defaults. A more appropriate choice in that case might be [&quot;esnext&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;dom.iterable&quot;].
This isn't an answer about compilation philosophy or best practice, but it's safer to compile to a single target environment for each compilation, and to restrict the included libraries to only what's available in that one target environment — this helps prevent using APIs that don't exist in the target environment and would cause runtime exceptions.

That was a bit of a journey, but I hope you now have greater confidence and better understanding of how library inclusion is handled during compilation.
","The issue you are facing is related to the configuration file `tsconfig.json` and the lib option within the `compilerOptions` section.

In Visual Studio Code, when specifying the `lib` option in the `tsconfig.json` file, it is expected to provide a list of JavaScript libraries that TypeScript should include in the compilation process. These libraries define the available global objects and their types.

However, the `esnext.full` value you are trying to use is not recognized by TypeScript or Visual Studio Code by default. It is not a valid option for the `lib` field.

In TypeScript, you can use different values for the `lib` option, such as `es5`, `es6`, `es2015`, `es2016`, `es2017`, `es2018`, `es2019`, `es2020`, `es2021`, `esnext`, `dom`, `dom.iterable`, `webworker`, `scripthost`, `es2015.core`, `es2015.collection`, `es2015.generator`, `es2015.iterable`, `es2015.promise`, `es2015.proxy`, `es2015.reflect`, `es2015.symbol`, `es2015.symbol.wellknown`, `es2016.array.include`, `es2017.object`, `es2017.sharedmemory`, `es2017.string`, `es2017.intl`, `es2017.typedarrays`, `es2018.asyncgenerator`, `es2018.asynciterable`, `es2018.intl`, `es2018.promise`, `es2018.regexp`, `es2019.array`, `es2019.object`, `es2019.string`, `es2019.symbol`, `es2020.bigint`, `es2020.promise`, `es2020.string`, `es2020.symbol.wellknown`, `es2021.promise`, `es2021.string`, `es2021.weakref`, and `esnext.array`.

To achieve the behavior you described (equivalent to `esnext` along with `DOM` and `DOM.Iterable`), you can specify the following `lib` option in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
""compilerOptions"": {
    ""lib"": [""esnext"", ""dom"", ""dom.iterable""]
}
```

This will include the necessary TypeScript typings for `esnext`, `DOM`, and `DOM.Iterable`, enabling you to use the corresponding JavaScript APIs and objects within your TypeScript code.

Once you update the `tsconfig.json` file, the warning in Visual Studio Code should disappear, and TypeScript will compile your code with the specified library options.",0.6363028883934021,"typescript, visual-studio-code, tsconfig",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5

A more appropriate choice in that case might be [&quot;esnext&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;dom.iterable&quot;].
This isn't an answer about compilation philosophy or best practice, but it's safer to compile to a single target environment for each compilation, and to restrict the included libraries to only what's available in that one target environment — this helps prevent using APIs that don't exist in the target environment and would cause runtime exceptions.

That was a bit of a journey, but I hope you now have greater confidence and better understanding of how library inclusion is handled during compilation.

Please, act as you have solid experience on these topics: typescript, visual-studio-code, tsconfig . [/INST] Okay, I have a solid background on typescript, visual-studio-code, tsconfig .  [INST] Please, explain how to fix the problem below. Why isn't ""esnext.full"" recognized as a valid ""lib"" option in VS Code?. Below, you can find more details. When I'm specifying a lib option on my compilerOptions:
    &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;esnext.full&quot;]
    }

VS Code gives a warning for esnext.full.  My understanding is that this should be valid, and should be roughly equivalent to specifying esnext along with DOM and DOM.Iterable.  How come VS Code doesn't recognize esnext.full?
. [/INST]  Ah, I see the problem. The issue is that VS Code doesn't recognize `esnext.full` as a valid `lib` option because it's not a recognized ECMAScript syntax.
The `lib` option in the `compilerOptions` object is expecting a list of ECMAScript module names, and `esnext.full` is not a valid module name. `esnext` is a module name that is recognized by TypeScript, but it's not a module name that is recognized by the ECMAScript standard.
To fix this issue, you can specify the `lib` option as an array of comma-separated module names, like this:
    ""compilerOptions"": {
        ""lib"": [""esnext"", ""dom"", ""dom.iterable""],
    }

This will tell TypeScript to include the `esnext` module, along with the `dom` and `dom.iterable` modules.
Alternatively, you can specify the `esnext` module explicitly, like this:
    ""compilerOptions"": {

        ""lib"": [""esnext""],
    }

This will tell TypeScript to include the `esnext` module, but not the `dom` or `dom.iterable` modules.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",0.8205711245536804,"typescript, visual-studio-code, tsconfig",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,llama
74844325,ASP.NET Core 6 application not using correct port when hosted in Azure App Service on Linux,"We have an ASP.NET Core 6 application where development was started already with ASP.NET Core 1 beta so some things might not have been migrated perfectly along the way.
We now tried to deploy it to an App Service on Linux instance running on a P1v3 plan.
In the docker default log I find

But the docker logs (without default in the name) I see

It seemed like the application was listening on port 5000, which is Kestrels default port, but all traffic was sent to 8080 which seems to be mapped to port 9463 in the above logs. That port is different for every restart but the application is always starting on port 5000.
I also tried adding the setting WEBSITES_PORT with the value 5000, but that didn't have much effect.
I assume that the site is started by executing dotnet xxx.dll but I cannot in the logs see that any other parameters are passed to the application. So the question is, how is the port (9463 in the above case) passed to the asp.net application and what code line would I need in program.cs or startup.cs to capture that setting? Or can I force the App service to bind to port 5000?
The alternative is to create a new ASP.NET Core 6 site for the VS template and start migrating the code, but preferably I would first like to just use the existing code.
","The startup command should've been right after appsvc/dotnetcore:6.0_20221116.6.tuxprod. Since it's not there, go to your Configuration blade under your app service, General Settings and set the Startup Command. Normally, oryx image will detected this command automatically, but it appears it didn't in your case.

","To fix the issue of the ASP.NET Core 6 application not using the correct port when hosted in Azure App Service on Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. In your ASP.NET Core application, open the `Program.cs` file.
2. Look for the `CreateHostBuilder` method. It should look something like this:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

3. Modify the `CreateHostBuilder` method to include the configuration for the port. Add the `UseUrls` method to specify the desired port. For example, to bind the application to port 5000, modify the method as follows:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>()
                .UseUrls(""http://localhost:5000"");
        });
```

4. Save the changes to `Program.cs` and redeploy your application to Azure App Service.

By explicitly specifying the port using the `UseUrls` method, you can ensure that the application listens on the correct port. This should resolve the issue of the application not using the correct port when hosted in Azure App Service on Linux.

Additionally, make sure that the Dockerfile used to build your container image exposes the correct port. You can do this by adding the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
EXPOSE 5000
```

This ensures that the port is exposed and accessible within the container.

After making these changes, your application should start listening on port 5000, and the traffic should be properly routed to that port.",0.3361048102378845,"azure-web-app-service, azure-web-app-for-containers",gpt-3.5-turbo,chat-gpt-3.5
