74891998,Is it possibel to create a keyfile from PhpMyAdmin's console for File Key Management Encryption Plugin (MariaDB)?,"As a client of my hosting provider I can not access MySQL folder to create a keyfile for MariaDB's File Key Management Encryption Plugin. I would like to encrypt tables with free tools with this limited access. I think maybe I can use PhpMyAdmin's console for this. Is it possible?
I'm using MariaDB's doc to install: link
I think I could install this plugin using PhpMyAdmin's console:

at least I did not get an error message when I run the command from command line, but how to create a file from this console, I have no ida. Anyone ever set up database encryption using PhpMyAdmin's console?

","encryption, phpmyadmin, console",0,74895655,"The plugin_load_add = file_key_management directive goes in the configuration file, it isn't a direct query that can be sent to the server. So first you'll have to edit the configuration file directly to add that directive.
The next step is setting up the key file that contains the encryption keys. Again, MariaDB wants that to exist on disk as a file in the computer's file system, so phpMyAdmin or any other direct SQL command can't help with that part.
There are some system variables that can be directly edited with phpMyAdmin (such as file_key_management_encryption_algorithm for defining the algorithm used for the encryption) and once the encryption is properly configured you can issue the SQL command to create an encrypted table, but you'll have to do the first couple of steps outside of phpMyAdmin or any other SQL interface.
In your case specifically, you would have to ask your hosting provider to handle the configurations for you or use a different encryption method.

75766948,"Why isn't ""esnext.full"" recognized as a valid ""lib"" option in VS Code?","When I'm specifying a lib option on my compilerOptions:
    &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;esnext.full&quot;]
    }

VS Code gives a warning for esnext.full.  My understanding is that this should be valid, and should be roughly equivalent to specifying esnext along with DOM and DOM.Iterable.  How come VS Code doesn't recognize esnext.full?
","typescript, visual-studio-code, tsconfig",0,75782069,"
Why isn't &quot;esnext.full&quot; recognized as a valid &quot;lib&quot; option in VS Code?

When searching for understanding, it's almost always more productive to seek the answer to questions when they're framed positively and skeptically (i.e. &quot;What does exist?&quot; / &quot;Why is x valid?&quot;) — so, in this case: &quot;Which values can be recognized?&quot; Answering this question will provide knowledge about a restrictive scope, and a foundation for the rest of the answer.
The compilerOptions.lib section in the TSConfig reference enumerates the built-in library and individual component identifiers which are valid for inclusion in a TSConfig (at the string array property compilerOptions.lib).
I won't copy the entire list here — it's very large and subject to change.
The documentation itself recognizes the fact that the allowed values do change — by the inclusion of this footnote:

This list may be out of date, you can see the full list in the TypeScript source code.

Presumably, the link pointed to a valid resource at one point in time, but as I write this answer, navigating to the resource results in a 404 response (Not Found). Perhaps the repo has been restructured since the documentation was last updated — the default branch currently does not have a top-level lib directory. However, by switching to a tag branch corresponding to a release (e.g. the v5.0.2 release from a few days ago), the top-level lib directory can be viewed:
https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/v5.0.2/lib
This is a directory of generated files (explained by the readme) — generated from data in the corresponding source directory src/lib.
So, up to this point, the best source for determining valid identifiers is &quot;consult the documentation&quot; — which, as we've seen, is not guaranteed to be up-to-date/exhaustive — and that's not even close to an acceptable answer in my opinion.
The documentation has to be derived from something, right?
Digging deeper into the source repo, we can find a module in the compiler code: src/compiler/commandLineParser.ts which contains a const array of tuples named libEntries. Here's a partial snippet for reference:
const libEntries: [string, string][] = [

  // ---snip---

  [&quot;es2023&quot;, &quot;lib.es2023.d.ts&quot;],
  [&quot;esnext&quot;, &quot;lib.esnext.d.ts&quot;],
  // Host only
  [&quot;dom&quot;, &quot;lib.dom.d.ts&quot;],
  [&quot;dom.iterable&quot;, &quot;lib.dom.iterable.d.ts&quot;],

  // ---snip---

];

This is used as the basis for valid library identifiers, and is used to create the following exports:
/**
 * An array of supported &quot;lib&quot; reference file names used to determine the order for inclusion
 * when referenced, as well as for spelling suggestions. This ensures the correct ordering for
 * overload resolution when a type declared in one lib is extended by another.
 *
 * @internal
 */
export const libs = libEntries.map(entry =&gt; entry[0]);

/**
 * A map of lib names to lib files. This map is used both for parsing the &quot;lib&quot; command line
 * option as well as for resolving lib reference directives.
 *
 * @internal
 */
export const libMap = new Map(libEntries);

This is more satisfying. If you want an authoritative list of valid identifiers for use as lib values, that's the place to view them. Be sure to consult the tag branch corresponding to the compiler version that you're using.

So now back to your question:

Why isn't &quot;esnext.full&quot; recognized as a valid &quot;lib&quot; option in VS Code?

The answer is now obviously simple: it's not recognized because it's not a valid identifier in the list.
This leads to your next question:

Why is there a library file with the .full suffix?

As you observed in a comment, TypeScript includes some declaration files internally which cannot be used in the array of library names at compilerOptions.lib in a TSConfig.
You linked to a JSON file in the source code which lists some strings in an array at a libs key — these represent partial, relative path names to internal declaration files (see src/lib). However, this is not a list of allowed library identifiers — it is simply a list for internal use by the compiler.
At the end of that list is a grouping of &quot;default libraries&quot; separated by a comment:
{
  &quot;libs&quot;: [

    // ---snip---

    // Default libraries
    &quot;es5.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2015.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2016.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2017.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2018.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2019.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2020.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2021.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2022.full&quot;,
    &quot;es2023.full&quot;,
    &quot;esnext.full&quot;
  ],

  // ---snip---
}

These values ending in the .full suffix refer to the internal declaration files which the compiler uses by default (in absence of a compilerOptions.lib array), according to the compilerOptions.target value:

Changing target also changes the default value of lib. You may “mix and match” target and lib settings as desired, but you could just set target for convenience.

Here's the utility function in the source which is used to derive the default library declaration file from the target:
src/compiler/utilitiesPublic.ts:
export function getDefaultLibFileName(options: CompilerOptions): string {
    switch (getEmitScriptTarget(options)) {
        case ScriptTarget.ESNext:
            return &quot;lib.esnext.full.d.ts&quot;;

        // ---snip---

        case ScriptTarget.ES2015:
            return &quot;lib.es6.d.ts&quot;;  // We don't use lib.es2015.full.d.ts due to breaking change.
        default:
            return &quot;lib.d.ts&quot;;
    }
}


Now, on to your final question:

What list of lib do I need to specify to get the equivalent of the default (everything pulled in by something like es2022.full), but for esnext or es2023?

You listed two ECMAScript API collections — I'll use the first one you mentioned (esnext) as the example. However, note that it's not a real spec — it refers to all &quot;bleeding edge&quot; features:

The special ESNext value refers to the highest version your version of TypeScript supports. This setting should be used with caution, since it doesn’t mean the same thing between different TypeScript versions and can make upgrades less predictable.

If you want to include the default libraries corresponding to esnext (esnext.full) in your compilation, here are two options for your TSConfig:

You can specify the libraries manually, along with your desired target:
First, in the TypeScript repo:

Navigate to the tag branch corresponding to the version of the compiler that you're using (in this example v5.0.2).

Navigate to the top-level lib directory, and find the declaration file that corresponds to your target name and ends with .full.d.ts (in this case lib.esnext.full.d.ts).


After finding the corresponding declaration file, identify all of the libraries which are referenced by triple-slash directives. I'll inline the relevant content from the file linked above:
/// &lt;reference no-default-lib=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;esnext&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;dom&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;webworker.importscripts&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;scripthost&quot; /&gt;
/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;dom.iterable&quot; /&gt;

In your config:

Set compilerOptions.target to your desired target (for example, I'll use &quot;es2020&quot;), and

Set the compilerOptions.lib array to the libraries identified from the previous step above.


This looks like:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es2020&quot;,
    &quot;lib&quot;: [
      &quot;esnext&quot;,
      &quot;dom&quot;,
      &quot;webworker.importscripts&quot;,
      &quot;scripthost&quot;,
      &quot;dom.iterable&quot;,
    ],

    // ---snip---
  },

  // ---snip---
}

By the way, these compiler options values are not case-sensitive.

More conveniently (if you're ok with whatever the current default behavior might be), you can let the compiler use the defaults according to your compilation target by omitting the compilerOptions.lib array:

Set compilerOptions.target to your target (in this case &quot;esnext&quot;), and

Don't define the compilerOptions.lib property at all.


This looks like:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;esnext&quot;,

    // ---snip---
  },

  // ---snip---
}

This will use the default libraries for your target (the internal esnext.full declaration file).



Finally, an observation: If you're targeting a normal browser environment, you likely don't want &quot;webworker.importscripts&quot; and &quot;scripthost&quot; which aren't part of that environment, but are included in the defaults. A more appropriate choice in that case might be [&quot;esnext&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;dom.iterable&quot;].
This isn't an answer about compilation philosophy or best practice, but it's safer to compile to a single target environment for each compilation, and to restrict the included libraries to only what's available in that one target environment — this helps prevent using APIs that don't exist in the target environment and would cause runtime exceptions.

That was a bit of a journey, but I hope you now have greater confidence and better understanding of how library inclusion is handled during compilation.

It seemed like the application was listening on port 5000, which is Kestrels default port, but all traffic was sent to 8080 which seems to be mapped to port 9463 in the above logs. That port is different for every restart but the application is always starting on port 5000.
I also tried adding the setting WEBSITES_PORT with the value 5000, but that didn't have much effect.
I assume that the site is started by executing dotnet xxx.dll but I cannot in the logs see that any other parameters are passed to the application. So the question is, how is the port (9463 in the above case) passed to the asp.net application and what code line would I need in program.cs or startup.cs to capture that setting? Or can I force the App service to bind to port 5000?
The alternative is to create a new ASP.NET Core 6 site for the VS template and start migrating the code, but preferably I would first like to just use the existing code.

An example of what I have in mind is an interface that looks more like this:

","r, user-interface, shiny, shinyapps, checkboxlist",6,75924343,"To create an answer for your solution, I've implemented a checkbox group input using the DT package. The solution comes in two parts: 1. The Helper functions. 2. The App.
Example Image

Helper Functions
The first helper function creates a data table with checkbox inputs, each with a unique id that is a combination of the rowname and column name.
The second helper function evaluates the 'checked' status of each of the checkboxes in the constructed table, returning a matrix with TRUE/FALSE values for each of the cells in the checkbox table.
App
The app code is pretty straight forward.
First, we create an example table using the first helper function.
Then, we render the table with DT, making sure to disable escape (so the checkboxes can be rendered), sorting, paging, and selection on the table. Most importantly, we send preDrawCallback and drawCallback JS functions to make sure the checkboxes are registered with shiny.
Lastly, any time the user interacts with the table, we call our second helper function to evaluate the checkbox statuses. You can do whatever you please with that information.

","hl7-fhir, hapi-fhir, dstu2-fhir",0,75899235,"This may depend on the FHIR server you're using
With the HAPI FHIR server a deleted resource is still considered to be an existing record, so simply calling PUT on that resource will &quot;un-delete&quot; it and create a new version, adding it to the resource's history.
Other FHIR servers might take a different interpretation.
With the Google Cloud Healthcare API, this would require enabling the &quot;update as create&quot; feature, or upsert operation https://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#upsert. This feature allows you to create a resource with an ID you specify by using PUT instead of POST. The Cloud Healthcare API does not differentiate between deleted and missing records for updates, so &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot; is required to &quot;re-create&quot; (vs &quot;un-delete&quot;) the resource. However, even though it is &quot;re-created&quot;, it will still become part of the resource's history.

I am trying to find a single code that will automatically create separate dictionaries for every single column having always as a reference the 'Name' column. Also I would like to name those dictionaries with the same name of the column but adding &quot;dict&quot; or &quot;list&quot; to the name.
What I got at the moment is the following:
`
lstName = list ( df.Name )
dictTester = dict ( zip ( list( df.Name ), list ( df.Tester )))
dictDeveloper = dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.Developer )))
dictArchitect = dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.Architect )))
dictEngineer = dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.Engineer )))
dictCyber_security = dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.Cyber_security )))
dictIT_support= dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.IT_support )))
dictBusiness_analyst = dict ( zip ( list ( df.Name ), list ( df.Business_analyst )))`

This works well, however if I want to do this with more than 100 columns, the codes will be a bit too long.
Can please anyone advice me how to get all in a single code and at the same time be able to name each dictionary as the codes above (dict+columnname) so I will be able to call each dictionary independently later on to add them in constraints in a model.

74955237,Assembly Definitions versus Namespace,"What is the difference between Assembly Definitions and namespaces in Unity?
Is writing your own namespaces mean you manually add AsmDefs in code?
Is code compile time faster in one or the other, or all the same?
","c#, unity3d, namespaces",0,74956821,"Apples and oranges.
Namespaces allow you to partition code to avoid name collision.  You can have multiple per assembly.
Assembly Definitions (ASMDEFs) is a purely Unity creation and simply a means to speed up compilation time.  They are best thought of as the equivalent to a project file in Visual Studio in the respect of speeding compilation time.  Rather than recompiling all your code, only the ASMDEF whose files were modified are recompiled whilst any follow-on ASMDEFs or non-ASMDEF code are simply “re-linked” (if applicable).

NOTE: Don’t make the mistake of thinking ASMDEFs only benefit the Unity build operation (the thing that takes 10 minutes+). They don’t.  They are mainly for decreasing the delays experienced in the Editor where you are waiting to hit the Play button.

Since the output of an ASMDEF is an assembly, naturally whatever you can do in c# code also applies such as confining the code to one or more namespaces.
With regards to compilation times, it doesn’t take much to push Unity over the edge whereby delays of minutes or more are not unheard of.  This always surprises new Unity users even those experienced with VS.  Unity takes considerable more time to compile the same amount of code compared to VS however there is a subtle explanation as to why.  Once you understand the mechanics you realise that comparing compilation times is also apples and oranges.
The reason is that, by default, ASMDEFs are disabled for user code and when Unity decides to compile your code, it does so for all platforms including x86, x64, Editor etc irrespective of your OS bitness or whether you intend to click that Play button.   This also applies to any 3rd party code you have.
For this reason, even if you don’t intend to use ASMDEFs in your own code, create a child folder for all the Standard Unity Assets and 3rd party code and create a corresponding ASMDEF for it. Don’t forget to limit the ASMDEF to just the platforms you need for the maximum benefit in speedy compilation.

The GITHUB_REF environment variable or GitHub.ref context variable should contain the tag of the release.

Another way to add files to the workflow is to use the GitHub CLI:

That way you don't need to pull in actions from the marketplace.

I'm using the regex ^\s*|\s*,\s*|\s*,?\s*$ for this, which works as intended for most cases. In particular, the beginning and the end should match with empty matches iff there is no whitespace (and/or a comma for the end). E.g. foo has 2 matches, one at 0-0 and one at 3-3.
Unfortunately, non-empty matches in the back are also followed by an empty match right at the end. Consider the following example (at regex):


Here, the fifth match (23-23) is unintended. I assume this match is found due to greedy nature of *. However, one cannot use the ? operator on the end token $ to make it non-greedy.
Is there a way to express my intended behavior (without the empty match at the end) using JavaScript regexes?
Edit: here are some examples (using _ instead of spaces for clarity)

foo 2 matches 0-0, 3-3
foo_,_bar 3 matches 0-0, 3-6, 9-9
___foo,_bar,_no_match,_ 4 matches 0-3, 6-8, 11-13, 21-23
foo_,bar_, 3 matches 0-0, 3-5, 8-10
_foo_ 2 matches 0-1, 4-5

I want to use dynamic font sizing, to make text in my app scale according to accessibility settings. However, the default pt sizes don't cover what I require.
Eg.:

Title 1 — 28pt


Title 2 — 22pt

I want to be able to use a 24pt font, with dynamic sizing. With the Large (default) setting, this is not possible... but if the user has the xLarge setting, Title 2 actually scales to 24pt...
As I am targeting iOS 15, I am using these modifiers on my Text so I can use a rounded font with dynamic sizing:
.font(.system(.title2, design: .rounded))
.fontWeight(.regular)

I've searched and searched, but none of the suggested answers work for me. I like the idea of being able to scale the existing dynamic type sizes by a multiplier but if I use .scaleEffect(value) it created pixellation when scaling up, and messes with padding even when scaling down.
","css, swift, swiftui",1,75397114,"You can create a font with a custom point size that scales with other dynamic fonts using:
Font.custom(_:size:relativeTo:)

e.g.
struct ContentView: View {
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text(&quot;Title&quot;).font(.title).border(.green)
            Text(&quot;Title&quot;).font(.title1½).border(.blue)
            Text(&quot;Title&quot;).font(.title2).border(.red)
                
        }
    }
}

extension Font {
    static let title1½ = Font.custom(&quot;&quot;, size: 24, relativeTo: .title2)
}

(leaving the name blank seems to return the system font)

You can adapt this to use rounded fonts in iOS 15. First you'll need to find the name of the font itself, using UIKit:
let font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 24, weight: .regular)
let fontDescriptor = font.fontDescriptor.withDesign(.rounded)!
let roundedFont = UIFont(descriptor: fontDescriptor, size: 24)
print(roundedFont.fontName)

// .AppleSystemUIFontRounded-Regular

You can use this in your custom Font method:
extension Font {
    static let title1Rounded = Font.custom(&quot;.AppleSystemUIFontRounded-Regular&quot;, size: 28, relativeTo: .title)
    static let title1½Rounded = Font.custom(&quot;.AppleSystemUIFontRounded-Regular&quot;, size: 24, relativeTo: .title2)
    static let title2Rounded = Font.custom(&quot;.AppleSystemUIFontRounded-Regular&quot;, size: 22, relativeTo: .title2)

I was also not sure of what you expected in return. Do you want only the elements in [expected dates] that are not in [dates], or do you want all the differences, i.e. including the dates in [dates] that are not in [expected dates] (extra dates)?
The code I am suggesting is:
checkDifference = function(A,B) {
    Av=strsplit(A,',')[[1]]
    Bv=strsplit(B,',')[[1]]
    Cv=c(setdiff(Bv,Av),setdiff(Av,Bv))

The function first splits both columns into vectors, applies a set difference, joins the resulting vector back to a string and returns it. A TERR expression function assumes inputs and outputs are entire columns of data, that is why I used the mapply function to apply the formula row by row.
In this case I am looking for all differences, if you only want the elements in [expected dates] that are not in [dates] you would replace this line, which concatenates both differences:
Cv=c(setdiff(Bv,Av),setdiff(Av,Bv)

with this, i.e. only the set of items that are in Bv but not Av:
Cv=setdiff(Bv,Av)

In order to put this code into Spotfire, you would from the top menu choose Data &gt; Data function properties &gt; Expression functions tab &gt; New..
Then in the editor copy and paste the code, give it a name e.g. TERR_checkDates, Function type=Column function, Return type=String, Category=Text functions.

There must be a way to structure this query better to improve the performance so any suggestions would be appreciated.
","sql, database, oracle, join",-1,75346365,"You are asking for the first 500 rows, so you only want a tiny fraction of your overall data. Therefore you want to use nested loops joins with appropriate indexes in order to get those 500 rows and be done, rather than have to process millions of rows and only then take off the top 500.
That however is complicated by the fact that you want the first 500 after ordering results. That ORDER BY will require a sort, and a sort operation will have to process 100% of the incoming rows in order to produce even its first row of output, which means you have to crunch 100% of your data and that kills your performance.
If your inner joins to TBL6, TBL4 and TBL5 are not meant to drop rows that don't have a matching key (e.g. if making those outer joins would result in the same # of result rows from TBL3), and if you don't really need to filter on extract(second from TBL5.EVENTTIME - TBL4.EventTime) * 1000 &gt; 250 which requires a join of TBL5 and TBL4 to accomplish, and if this CUSTOMER_OVERVIEW_V view is a simple single-table view that doesn't apply any predicates (not likely), or if you can bypass the view and hit the table directly, then you can do this:

Create a 2-column function-based index (e.g. customer_eventtime_idx) on (DECODE(sourceaddress,NULL,'Y','N'),eventtime) of table you need from the customer_overview_v view, in that exact column order.

Rewrite the query to get the 500 rows as early as possible, preferably before any joins, using a hint to force a descending index scan on this index. You will also need to change your IS NOT NULL predicate to the same DECODE function used in the index definition:
SELECT /*+ LEADING(c) USE_NL(csr c1 c2 adr) */
       [columns needed]
  FROM (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE INDEX_DESC(x customer_eventtime_idx) */
               [columns you need]
          FROM TABLE_UNDER_CUSTOMER_OVERVIEW_V x
         WHERE DECODE(SOURCEADDRESS,NULL,'Y','N') = 'N'
         ORDER BY DECODE(SOURCEADDRESS,NULL,'Y','N') DESC,EVENTTIME DESC
         FETCH FIRST 500 ROWS ONLY) c
       INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_SALE_RELATED ... csr
       INNER JOIN CUSTOMER ... c1
       INNER JOIN CUSTOMER ... c2
       OUTER APPLY ([address subquery like you have it]) adr
 WHERE extract(second from c.EVENTTIME - c1.EventTime) * 1000 &gt; 250



Generate your explain plan and make sure you see the index scan descending operation on the index you created - it must say descending, and also ensure that you see ORDER BY NOSORT step afterwards... it must say NOSORT. Creating the index as we have and ordering our query as we have was all about getting these plan operations to be selected. This is not easy to get to work right. Every detail around the inner c query must be crafted precisely to achieve the trick.
Explanation:
Oracle should seek/access the index on the DECODE Y/N result, so find the N records (those that have a non-null sourceaddress) in the first column of the index starting at the leading edge of the N values, then get the corresponding row from the table, then step backward to the pervious N value, get that table row, then the previous, etc.. emitting rows as they are found. Because the ORDER BY matches the index exactly in the same direction (descending), Oracle will skip the SORT operation as it knows that the data coming out of the index step will already be in the correct order.
These rows therefore stream out of the c inline view as they are found, which allows the FETCH FIRST to stop processing when it gets too 500 rows of output without having to wait for any buffering operation (like a SORT) to complete. You only ever hit those 500 records - it never visits the rest of the rows.
You then join via nested loops to the remaining tables, but you only have 500 driving rows. Obviously you must ensure appropriate indexing on those tables for your join clauses.
If your CUSTOMER_ORDER_V view however does joins and applies more predicates, you simply cannot do this with the view. You will have to use the base tables and apply this trick on whatever base table has that eventtime column, then join in whatever you need that the view was joining to and reproduce any remaining needed view logic (though you might find it does more than you need, and you can omit much of it). In general, don't use views whenever you can help it. You always have more control against base tables.
Lastly, note that I did not follow your TBL1, TBL2, TBL3, etc. alias convention. That is hard to read because you have to constantly look elsewhere to see what &quot;TBL3&quot; means. Far better to use aliases that communicate immediately what table they are, such as the initial letter or couple letters or acronym from the first letter of each word, etc..

75259576,Finding Missing Constraint,"When I build my app Xcode gives me five warnings relating to missing constraints.  But clicking on them in the Navigation Panel only takes me to a ViewController in the Storyboard and doesn't highlight which view has the problem.

In addition, as shown above, the Storyboard doesn't contain any yellow triangles at all, so I'm at a loss as to how to find which view is missing the constraints.
The errors don't appear when I run the app, so how to I try to trap these errors in the build?
(Xcode 14.2)
","xcode, autolayout, constraints, interface-builder",0,75276930,"Xcode and Storyboards have lots of bugs...
One that you're encountering is the failure to show error/warning indicators.
This is how it should look:

Clicking that indicator will show you the specific warnings - and hovering over one shows you the view in question:

However, those indictors and descriptions are sometimes missing. Seems to happen most often when you have multiple view controllers in a single Storyboard.
You could copy each controller to a new Storyboard to see if the information shows up - but, based on my experience, it's hit-or-miss.
In your specific case, warnings such as:

Leading constraint is missing, which may cause overlapping with other views.

can be safely ignored... provided you know and understand the layout you've designed.

A webpage can only query for whether the user has granted it certain permissions using the Permissions API.
If you want to let your users know why your website wants that permission and what it was use it for, just do it in your website itself.

74625933,Lucene.net 4.8 sort returns doc with NULL fields. Invalidating sort,"Using Lucene.Net, the indexer index object with a field in Document specifically used for sorting like this :
new TextField(&quot;lastname-sort&quot;, person.LastName.RemoveDiacritics(), Field.Store.NO)
However when searching with sort using new SortField(&quot;lastname-sort&quot;, SortFieldType.STRING, false) will return some scoreDocs (the first ones) with fields to null, which is odd to me.
After researching in the doc (https://lucenenet.apache.org/docs/4.8.0-beta00005/api/Lucene.Net/Lucene.Net.Search.Sort.html?q=sort) - that is not up-to-date, because using new Field is deprecated and using Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED is also deprecated... and Stackoverflow, I do not find any answer ...
Note that if the fields of the ScoreDocs hits are not null, they are correctly sorted.
EDIT :
Here is how the sort is made, roughly. Code is simplified. query is not null, searcher, reader and sort are not null.
Document contains a field for sorting, and multiple other stored fields:
var doc = new Document 
{
  new TextField(&quot;lastname-sort&quot;, person.LastName.RemoveDiacritics(), Field.Store.NO),
  //other fields
}

sort:
var sort = new Sort(new SortField(&quot;lastname-sort&quot;, SortFieldType.STRING));

search:
TopDocs hits = _indexSearcher!.Search(query, _nrtIndexReader!.NumDocs, sort)

In the hits results, the top X ScoreDocs (a dozen out of 6000 - always the same) have all their Document's fields to NULL (they are not NULL when indexed).
var indexedPersons = hits.ScoreDocs.Select(hit =&gt; _indexSearcher.Doc(hit.Doc)).Select(document =&gt;
            {
                return new IndexedPerson
                {
                    Uid = document.Get(&quot;uid&quot;),
                    FirstName = document.Get(&quot;firstname&quot;),
                    LastName = document.Get(&quot;lastname&quot;),
                    // Some Other Fields
                };
            }).ToList();

Note UID is not NULL, which allow us to retrieve the other values from the DB.
","c#, lucene, lucene.net",1,75591726,"The null fields were returned because of this analyzer used to index and search :
 private readonly StandardAnalyzer _standardAnalyzer = new(AppLuceneVersion);
Meaning some lastname (Will, To, etc.) were considered stopWords. fields are therefore set to NULL and the sort would sort them like the field was empty (null).
Modifying to private readonly StandardAnalyzer _standardAnalyzer = new(AppLuceneVersion, CharArraySet.EMPTY_SET); solved the issue.

75606592,When opening through filedialog in tkinter is there a way that pictures would stay if opened one by one?,"I have been just experimenting with tkinter's filedialog. What I know is that images have to be a global variable somehow to become visible. Which is alright as within modules you can use the word &quot;global&quot; so that the variable would be able to be accessed outside of the function as well and hence be visualized, but unfortunately with askopenfilename it updates the global variable hence if you open pictures one by one the previous one always disappears.
My question is how can I implement it in my code that my function would create global variables so that my images would always be visible.
Or is there another way I could do it? I know about that I can open more files at once and they will all be loaded and be visualized but my question is strictly about opening images one by one.
I tried to mess with my functions a little and try to make it work somehow that's why my code is a bit more split... But I hope someone out there can help me about this issue!

pic_counter = [0, 0]


def pic_counter_checker():
    pic_counter[0] += 1
    if pic_counter[0] % 3 == 0:
        pic_counter[0] = 0
        pic_counter[1] += 1


files_list = []


def pic_factory():
    global img
    for pic in files_list:
        img = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(pic))
        img_label = tk.Label(gallery_frame, image=img)
        img_label.grid(row=pic_counter[1], column=pic_counter[0])


def open_picture():
    dir_path = &quot;C:/Users/Marci/PycharmProjects/Images&quot;
    filename = tk.filedialog.askopenfilename(initialdir=dir_path, title=&quot;Open your file&quot;)
    files_list.append(filename)
    name_label = tk.Label(gallery_frame, text=filename)
    name_label.grid(row=pic_counter[1], column=pic_counter[0])

    pic_counter_checker()
    print(files_list)


lab1 = tk.Label(root, text=&quot;Open your file to add to the gallery&quot;)
lab1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=10)
btn1 = tk.Button(root, text=&quot;Open file&quot;, command=open_picture)
btn1.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=10)

root.mainloop()


The original way obviously did not work as the global variable kept getting updated and lost its visuals after each new file that has been opened. So I thought maybe if I create a function for a loop and assign inside a global variable (see: pic_factory()) somehow that &quot;globalness&quot; could be inherited but of course it was stupid and I did not have my hopes up so much either, but I thought it's might worth a try... since this is a weird phenomenon already that an image must be a global variable in order to be visualized.
I appreciate any help!
","tkinter, python-imaging-library",0,75610569,"You can use an attribute of the created label instead of global variable to store the reference of the image:

Note that you should not use a for loop inside pic_factory().

Actually you can combine name_label and img_label into one label:

It already works, but unfortunately the pod isn't terminated after the command. In Kubernetes, the pod is still alive and it's status is &quot;Succeeded&quot;.

In your example, you are just executing a command in a running container, where postgres is started already.
You need to overvrite the command which is executed when the container is started.
Executing your command: (the error comes only because i didnt install any postgres)

This will work if your postgres on localhost has right credentials.
Or it will return like so, because connection couldnt be established:

I have looked for a short and optimal way to do this but I haven't found it. I would like to avoid doing several merges. Would you have ideas?
","pandas, dataframe, group-by",0,75581458,"IIUC, you can extract the month with to_datetime and dt.month, then compute a pivot_table with a custom function (are both months present for a given combination), then sum to count:
(df.assign(month=pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%Y%m%d').dt.month)
   .pivot_table(index='id_1', columns='id_2', values='month',
                aggfunc=lambda x: set(x)&lt;={1, 12})
   .sum(axis=1).reset_index(name='Nb')

Or with a crosstab:
pd.crosstab(df['id_1'], df['id_2'],
            values=pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%Y%m%d').dt.month,
            aggfunc=lambda x: set(x)&lt;={1, 12}

Output:
   id_1   Nb
0    12  2.0
1    18  1.0

Intermediate before the sum:
id_2     1     2     5      7
id_1                         
12    True  True   NaN    NaN
18     NaN   NaN  True  False

Or using a double groupby:
(df.assign(month=pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%Y%m%d').dt.month)
   .groupby(['id_1', 'id_2'])['month'].agg(lambda x: set(x)&lt;={1, 12})

74829371,C++ Templates: Explicit specialization vs Complete specialization. Is it the same thing?,"In microsoft's documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/templates-cpp?view=msvc-170#template-specialization, it is said that Specializations in which all parameters are specialized are complete specializations.
but I also hear the cpp reference talking about explicit specialization here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_specialization
Are &quot;explicit specialization&quot; and &quot;complete specialization&quot; two different terminology for the same thing?
","c++, c++17",0,74830498,"It seems that they are referring to explicit specialzations, which is the term used in the standard. The term full specialization is also common.
The technical term explicit specialization may not be a good choice because the word explicit already is very overloaded. For example it can easily be confused with explicit instantiation or the explicit keyword.
The difference between explicit (or full/complete) specializations and partial specializations is however important and not just a matter of giving a specific variant of partial specialization an additional name. In contrast to a partial specialization, an explicit (or full/complete) specialization is not itself a template. So it basically follows all the rules of non-templates, including e.g. how inline and the ODR rule is applied. An explicit specialization also doesn't require any instantiation.

Server socket listening to traffic:

received socket connection and connection is accepted

Application is receiving excessive handle_output() where our app
inherits from ACE_Event_Handler in Event_Handler.cpp .
The excessive calls to output_handler from ACE causes a CPU issue.

we ran the profiler we see a lot of calls to  ACE_handle_Set::Reset() (125,000 calls)
and ACE_Event_Handler::set_max(87,000 calls), not sure ?


My question is there a way to stop callbacks from ACE handle_output() and what is triggering
ACE_handle_Set::Reset() ?
running the application in Linux VM or ec2 have the same issue CPU up to 100%
","c++, ace",1,75617003,"This is because of a difference in the way the underlying Reactor implementations on Windows and Linux behave. Complete details are in &quot;The ACE Programmer's Guide&quot; section 7.2.3. Windows WFMO is &quot;edge triggered&quot; so handle_output is only triggered when the socket goes from not-writeable to writeable. Linux is &quot;level-triggered&quot; so handle_output will continue to be called back as long as it returns 0 and the socket remains writeable as it almost always is.
One way to handle this is to only register for output when the app has something to write, has attempted the write, and it could not complete. This is portable behavior across both platforms. The book has a more complete example and explanation.

I tried defaultdict method but it was generating a json with values as list which was not acceptable to make a table on it. Here's what I did:
import json
from collections import defaultdict

INPUT = 'demofile.txt'
dict1 = defaultdict(list)

def convert():
    with open(INPUT) as f:
        for line in f:
            command, description = line.strip().split(None, 1)
            dict1[command].append(description.strip())
    OUTPUT = open(&quot;demo1file.json&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
    json.dump(dict1, OUTPUT, indent = 4, sort_keys = False)

and was getting this:
     &quot;Report_for&quot;: [ &quot;Reconciliation&quot; ], 
     &quot;Execution_of&quot;: [ &quot;application_1673496470638_0001&quot; ],

You will have to programmatically tell your application how it works.

for line_str in input_str.split('\n'):

    line = line_str.split(' ')

    # if key is in nesting, create new sub-dict, all consecutive entries are part of the sub-dict        
    if line[0] in current_nesting.keys():
        current_nesting = current_nesting[line[0]]
        upper_nestings.append(line[0])
        upper_nesting_keys.append(line[1])
        working_dict[line_str] = {}
        working_dict = working_dict[line_str]

    else:
        # if a new &quot;parallel&quot; or &quot;upper&quot; nesting is detected, reset your nesting structure
        if line[0] in upper_nestings:
            nests = upper_nestings[:upper_nestings.index(line[0])]
            keys = upper_nesting_keys[:upper_nestings.index(line[0])]
        
            working_dict = result_dict
            for nest in nests:

","javascript, node.js, npm, npm-publish",0,75681461,"ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG means that an attempt has been made to create a string longer than the maximum allowed length.
0x1fffffe8 means 512MB, which is the maximum allowed length for the above case.
The npm publish command tries to create a tarball with contents inside your package folder and convert that tarball data into a base64 encoded string. And in this case, it has become larger than the maximum allowed length (512MB), which caused this error too.
To fix this, carefully inspect the contents output with npm notice &lt;size&gt; &lt;file&gt; and remove the unnecessary data inside your package (e.g. cache folder ~/.npm/_cacache/).

I will prefer this.
First don't fetch any data when form load.
when user click on select2 input provide search functionality,
when user start typing for search at that time you need to implement ajax call for fetch related data ( user type in select2 search input ) from database table.

A possbile solution is to add another AdaptiveText in to the first AdaptiveGroup but without text. Then the first AdaptiveGroup will looks like the same as the second AdaptiveGroup.  Also, you could change the AdaptiveSubgroup.HintTextStacking property to sets the vertical alignment of this subgroup's content.

75355962,How do I process a block of code with proceed results stored in variable in php?,"I have a php app where I have snippets of code that I want to process and store in a variable. It might be the output of array data with HTML that I want stored…
$myVar = { // bracket represents starting the store

  foreach ($myarray as $key =&gt; $value) {
    echo ‘&lt;td&gt;’ . $value . ‘&lt;/td&gt;’;
  }
}// close bracket represents end store


Now the variable would hold the value of what that full echo output would be.
Is there a php function, process, or recommend way of doing this.
I don’t have a framework I’m using on this project.
I am looking for a solution because I don’t know the right approach.
",php,0,75356016,"You can use the ob_start and ob_get_clean functions to store the output of the code in a variable:
    ob_start();
    foreach ($myarray as $key =&gt; $value) {
      echo ‘&lt;td&gt;’ . $value . ‘&lt;/td&gt;’;
    }
    $myVar = ob_get_clean();

ob_start turns on output buffering, which captures all output from your script and stores it in a buffer. The ob_get_clean function then retrieves the contents of the buffer and discards it, leaving you with the contents stored in the $myVar variable.

","bash, jq",0,75941233,"If your input has a JSON document followed by other content, you can make your jq only read that one input:
extract=$(jq -n &quot;input | ._links&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$response&quot;)

The -n tells jq not to read anything by default; the -n, used exactly once, tells it to read one thing.

You could also extract both the _links attribute and the HTTP status code with just one invocation of jq:
IFS=$'\n' read -r -d '' extract http_code &lt; &lt;(
  jq -nc '

Using read -d '' causes read to fail if it doesn't find a NUL at the end of input, and the &amp;&amp; printf '\0' adds a NUL at the end of the process substitution's output if jq reports success.

74994814,Why don't my @State array elements hold their values?,"I've got an array of Die structs declared as an @State variable in ContentView. However, whenever I modify the values of a given element in the array those new values are immediately lost and the element reverts to it's initial state. Initially I thought this was because I'm assigning the array an initial value in ContentView, but then I also assign a value of 1 to another @State variable, numDice and it maintains it's value once it's been changed.
die.Roll() has no effect beyond changing the die value while the Roll() function is running, but the value is immediately lost upon exiting the function.

I am currently trying to add the next vehicle section in my addVehicleInstalment method. Any suggestions on how I can do this. I think I need to use indexes to identify which vehicle is for which object in my model.
I have added a very generic stackblitz example with just basic HTML functionality as I currently have it
https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ngfor-click-index-inhntc?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts
",angular,0,74674829,"you should use FormArray, where every item is a FormGroup:
ngOnInit() {
    this.vehicleForm = new FormGroup({
      vehicleAccounts: new FormArray([]),
    });

    // start with one empty account
    this.addInstalment();
  }

  addInstalment() {
    const vehicleAccount = new FormGroup({
      instalment: new FormControl(),
      settle: new FormControl(false),
      accountNumber: new FormControl(),
      financedBy: new FormControl(),
    });

    this.vehicleAccounts.push(vehicleAccount);
  }

Then, you define a getter to access this array in the template:
get vehicleAccounts() {
    return this.vehicleForm.controls['vehicleAccounts'] as FormArray;
  }

On every button click, you add a new FormGroup to the array and let it display via ngFor.
And this is the template:


&lt;form [formGroup]=""vehicleForm"" (ngSubmit)=""submit()""&gt;
  &lt;div formArrayName=""vehicleAccounts""&gt;
    &lt;div
      *ngFor=""let vehicleAccountForm of vehicleAccounts.controls; let i = index""

","c#, .net, mstest",0,75238807,"Entity Framework is treating the List&lt;String&gt; as a navigation property, e.g. it expects there to be a table of string which it can join to the GameWord table.
Relational databases do not support a column being a 'list' - you have to create a separate table and use a foreign key and a join, or map the column to a different type e.g. convert the values to a comma-separated string or a json string
As a separate table:
public class GameWord
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public List&lt;Attempt&gt; WordProgress { get; set; } = new List&lt;Attempt&gt;();

    public int GameWordId { get; set; }
    public GameWord GameWord { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string Value { get; set; }
}

As a comma-separated string:
// The Entity that you have defined doesn't need to be changed
public class GameWord
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public List&lt;Attempt&gt; WordProgress { get; set; } = new List&lt;Attempt&gt;();

    [Required]
    public Word Word { get; set; }

    public Game Game { get; set; }
    public bool Finished { get; set; } = false;

// Just specify how to convert the C# property to the SQL value
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;GameWord&gt;()
        .Property(c =&gt; c.WordProgress)
        .HasConversion(
            attempts =&gt; string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, attempts),
            csv =&gt; csv.Split(',')
        );
}

As json:
// Specify a different conversion
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;GameWord&gt;()
        .Property(c =&gt; c.WordProgress)
        .HasConversion(
            attempts =&gt; JsonSerializer.Serialize(attempts, (JsonSerializerOptions)null),
            json =&gt; JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(json, (JsonSerializerOptions)null)
        );
}


When you see how easy it is to add a json or csv column to a table with Entity Framework, you might think the first approach of adding a whole new table is overkill. I would still recommend starting with that approach, and only switch to a custom conversion if performance is affected by the join operation (which I think is unlikely here). The reasons being:

Navigation properties with an ORM are common and easy for devs to understand. Custom conversions are not. They are a specific feature of Entity Framework Core, and there are some subtleties in how a conversion affects the change tracking done by EF
If you decide in the future that you want to store more than just a single 'word' value, maybe the 'word' and the time at which the attempt was made, you have to write a funky migration script to unpack the values in the column and convert them to a different format. With a dedicated entity type and child table, you can just add a new column.
Entity Framework usually can't translate SQL filter operations on a converted column. If you want to search for all games where the player has attempted the word 'Fruit', you would have to write the SQL yourself. If you use a child table and navigation properties, this is simple to write:

context.GameWords.Where(
    gameWord =&gt; gameWord.WordProgress.Any(
        attempt =&gt; attempt.Value == &quot;Fruit&quot;
    )
)

74836161,How does the `auto` keyword work in lambda functions?,"I am new to templates and lambdas function and I am trying to understand what's happening in this piece of code:
function&lt;void (const int &amp;)&gt; foo = [&amp;](auto x) {
    x = 42;
}

Here, I assume the compiler is able to tell from the auto keyword that x has type const int &amp;. Therefore, the compiler should not allow the assignment x = 42.
However, this code compiles without error, which confuses me. Why does the compiler allow this? What did the compiler actually deduced for the auto keyword?
","c++, c++14, auto",2,74836228,"auto is never deduced to a reference. It always deduces to a decayed type.
When passed a const int &amp; (or any reference to some type T), then it will be deduced to int (or the decayed type T). (Or to be more precise, when passed an expression of type T with any value category, it will always deduce to the decayed type T. Types of expressions never include references, which are instead translated into value categories.)
You can still assign the lambda, because it is possible to initialize an int from a const int&amp; (or more precisely from an lvalue expression of type const int). This is what will happen when you call foo.
So you are assigning here to a local parameter object inside the function. The assignment is not visible outside the lambda.
If you want to deduce a reference, use auto&amp;&amp;. This however will then always deduce a reference. It also won't decay the type, so the const will be retained.

For testing you could just here give these lines:

    $title = $_POST['title'];
    $category = $_POST['category'];

75005196,How can I convert all SEO urls to lowercase in Shopware 6?,"I want to have only lowercase SEO URLs in my Shopware 6 shop. How can I achieve this in the Administration area of Shopware 6?
","shopware, shopware6",1,75007717,"Adding to the answer of Marcus:

after adding the |lower filter in the SEO settings, you need to re-build the URL indices which can also be done via the systems menu.
There might be cases where the URL is still using uppercase, this can happen if URLs where imported or changed after automatic generation.

You could use the SQL query
UPDATE seo_url SET seo_path_info = LOWER(seo_path_info);

once to make all existing SEO paths lowercase.
Use this at your own risk, as former existing links using upper-case might now cause 404 errors. So there is a chance that this might have a negative impact on SEO.

I'm at a bit of a loss on how to do this. My first thought was to:
SELECT t1.Entity as Entity1, t2.Entity as Entity2, COUNT(*) as Count
FROM (
SELECT Entity, CONCAT(Date, Location) AS ConcatenatedValue, COUNT(*) 
FROM occurrences 
WHERE Year(Date) = 2022) t1,
(SELECT Entity, CONCAT(Date, Location) AS ConcatenatedValue, COUNT(*)
FROM occurrences
WHERE Year(Date) = 2022) t2
WHERE t1.ConcatenatedValue = t2.ConcatenatedValue
GROUP BY Entity1, Entity2
ORDER BY Count

Clearly that doesn't do what I need. HELP! My head is spinning.
","mysql, sql, multiple-occurrence",2,75010649,"You can address this problem with a self join on your table, with the following conditions:

date must match
location must match
1st table entity is smaller than 2nd table entity

Then you can apply aggregation directly.
SELECT t1.Entity      AS entity1,
       t2.Entity      AS entity2,
       COUNT(t1.Date) AS cnt
FROM       tab t1
INNER JOIN tab t2
        ON t1.Date = t2.Date 
       AND t1.Location = t2.Location 
       AND t1.Entity &lt; t2.Entity
GROUP BY entity1, entity2
ORDER BY entity1, entity2

75579311,How to implement 'Expand All' and 'Collapse All' buttons for MUI accordion group?,"I'm working on a section which display logs in the form on MUI accordions. I have got the accordions working normally i.e. expand and collapse work.

","reactjs, material-ui, react-mui",0,75584236,"Steps to get it working.

Maintain a state array containing the index values of each of the accordions that are expanded. Set empty array [] as the initial value.
Set onClick handler of the accordions to add the index of accordion to the array if it's not already present, and remove it if it is.
Set expanded prop of the accordions to be truthy only if the index value of the accordion belongs to the state array.
For the Collapse All button, just clear the state array to [], which will trigger all the accordions to collapse.
For the Expand All button, create a new array containing index values of all the accordions and then set this new array to be the state array, which effectively means that all accordions are expanded.

You did not specify an image source for the input element. Unlike other elements, like DIV or input[type=text] you cannot specify a background image the way that you have.


The solution is to remove the following from your CSS code: background-image: url(...)

Then you will want to extract the Base64 encoded image out from url(...).

Finally, copy the base 64 URL to the src attribute of the image element.



This solution is similar to using an &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; element (with the src attribute).

[username].github.io/[somthing]

but I am wondering how to make a URL without that project name or &quot;[something]&quot; to be just

[username].github.io

I know I can do this on https://pages.github.com/ by naming it by my username, but then the URL is:

[username].github.io/[username]

","github, url, sites",-1,74973711,"
when I do that URL is [username].github.io/[username].

From &quot;Types of GitHub Pages sites&quot;, it should not be that URL.

To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named &lt;username&gt;.github.io.
Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io or http(s)://&lt;organization&gt;.github.io.

Example: https://github.com/square/square.github.io gives you https://square.github.io/, not https://square.github.io/square.

Modules do not have lexical visibility.
While Rust lets you create nested modules without creating new files the semantics don't change. That is, by design
mod foo {
    // content here
}

and
mod foo;

// foo.rs
// content here

have exactly the same behaviour, intentionally: it makes the implementation simpler, and lets you break up files  by moving contents from nested modules into external files, and nothing more.
That means exactly as in Python, for one module to see the contents of an other, you need some sort of cross-module import.
So your original code is exactly the same as:
// mod.rs 

use rand::Rng;
use std::io;

pub mod guess_game;

// guess_game.rs
pub fn start(){
    ...
}

which in Python translates to:
# __init__.py
import random
import io

from . import guess_game

# guess_game.py
def start():
    # uses random and io

Do you expect that to work? No? There's your answer.

75211654,Double clicking on a storyboard in VS for Mac doesn't open as a project in xcode,"We have recently upgrade our Xamarin project to .Net 6.
Before the upgrade, when we opened up the project in Visual Studio for MAC we could double click on the storyboard, and it would open in XCode as a project. Meaning we could see the generated header files (among other) and assign outlets from the scenes to the code which we could then use in our C# code.
After the upgrade, we can still double click the storyboard, but now it only opens the storyboard in XCode and it not longer opens it as a project (similar to what would happen if you double click the storyboard from Finder), this results in us not being able to see the header files and thus no longer assign our outlets.
I am using VS for MAC 17.4.3 and XCode 14.2.
We can still compile, build and run the app. This will show us the existing scenes (and they work).
Does anyone have any idea how this can be fixed again?

But beware of == on floats, since they can be imprecise.
Likewise:

a = data[0]

add dummy rows to data[0] to be able to create a 3d result

You can perform such operation using torch.einsum (read more about here):

Notice how we used subscripts e different to c. The corresponds to the pseudo-code:

...     R[a,b,c,d] += X[a,b,c,d]*Y[d,e]

75193954,Maths problem trying to work out commission for a user within a booking system,"I have a maths problem I am struggling to get as accurate as I can when working out commission within a JavaScript application.
A user as part of this system has a commission threshold:
[
  {
    id: 123,
    commissionThreshold: 3700
  },

  {
    id: 456,
    commissionThreshold: 3000
  }
]

A user also has bookings within the system
[
  {
    id: 1,
    user: 123,
    commission: 20, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 4000
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    user: 123,
    commission: 20, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 2000
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    user: 456,
    commission: 20, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 3000
  } 
]

Commission is worked out by taking the overall booking profit for a users bookings, minus the users commission threshold from the booking profit. If that booking profit - threshold is greater than 0, commission is X percent of the booking profit - threshold. X percent is the commission value from the booking.
For the above dataset this is simple because all bookings have the same commission.
// user 1 has 2 bookings
// total booking profit for user 1 = 6000
// booking profit - threshold for user 1 = 2300
// commission for user 1 = 2300 / 0.2 = 460 // 0.2 is from all bookings have commission of 20%
// commission for user 1 = 460

// commission for user 2 would be 0
// booking profit = 3000
// commission booking profit - threshold &lt; 0 so no commission is paid

The problem is some bookings in reality have different commissions so you can't add up all totals, then work out commission from that.
[
  {
    id: 1,
    user: 123,
    commission: 20, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 4000
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    user: 123,
    commission: 15, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 2000
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    user: 123,
    commission: 25, // this is the percentage commission to be paid for this booking
    bookingProfit: 6000
  },
]

In the example above where user 123 has 3 bookings all with different commission percentages how would I go about working out the total commission from all bookings because the commission threshold is the total for all bookings within the dataset not per booking?
I am stumped.
The solution I have at present is for each:
// calculate the total booking profit from all the users bookings
// then for each booking work out the percentage of the total booking profit the individual booking profit is
// get the same percentage of the commission threshold
// do the relative booking profit - relative threshold &gt; 0 ? relative booking profit - relative threshold * booking commission percentage : 0a


//e.g.
// total booking profit for user 123 in above is 12000
// for booking 1
4000 / 12000 = 0.333333333333333
user threshold 3700 * 0.333333333333333 = 1233.3333333333321;
4000 - 1233.3333333333321 = 2766.6666666666679
2766.6666666666679 * 0.2 (booking percentage) = 553.33333333333358

TInner.constructor.Create(Name: TName; Sub: TSub);
TSub.constructor.Create(Name: TName);
TName.constructor.Create(Name: String);
var Names = TStack&lt;String&gt;.Create;

If it is possible to intercept before and after resolve it would be possible to implement a parent, ancestor or, 'i am being constructed for ...'.
for example
RegisterType&lt;TName&gt;(
  function: TName
    begin
      Result:=TName.Create(String.Join('.',Names.List.ToArray));

        Sub 
          Name = 'Outer.Inner.Sub'
            

I did think it might be possible by sub classing the component activator and looking for if classname=TName or if arguments.contains(TName) then ...
For this example I have omitted making the Names stack handle multiple threads and in reality I am not using names but rather having a stack of interfaces each knowing who their 'parent' is but this demonstrates what I am trying to implement.
","delphi, spring4d",0,75804075,"Instance creation is ultimately done within the component activator.
If you create a decorator for that you can solve your requirement.
I will just write down the code - you can package this into a container extension that does all the stuff automatically (look into the Spring.Container.*Extension units).
For brevity, I will leave out all standard creation and cleanup code and any code to make this thread-safe.
type
  TComponentActivatorDecorator = class(TInterfacedObject, IComponentActivator)
  private
    fActivator: IComponentActivator;
  public
    constructor Create(const activator: IComponentActivator);
    function CreateInstance(const context: ICreationContext): TValue;
  end;

type
  TComponentActivatorBaseAccess = class(
    Spring.Container.ComponentActivator.TComponentActivatorBase)
  end;

function TComponentActivatorDecorator.CreateInstance(
  const context: ICreationContext): TValue;
var
  name: string;
begin
  // yes, this is a bit ugly because the information about the handled type 
  // is not passed to the method but a protected state of the activator
  // actually this should (and actually is but only internally) be part of
  // the ICreationContext - this might change in the future
  name := TComponentActivatorBaseAccess(TObject(fActivator)).Model.ComponentType.Name;
  Names.Push(name);
  try
    Result := fActivator.CreateInstance(context);
  finally
    Names.Pop
  end;
end;

After the call to Build you run this code:
  for Model in GlobalContainer.Registry.FindAll() do
  begin
    if Model.ComponentActivator is TReflectionComponentActivator then
      Model.ComponentActivator := TComponentActivatorDecorator.Create(Model.ComponentActivator);
  end;

Now every activator that does the object creation via reflection (so not the ones doing by a delegate) is being decorated and executes the extra push/pop logic and you access that in your TName delegate.
I declared TName as follows:
type
  TName = type string;

and its registration:
GlobalContainer.RegisterType&lt;TName&gt;(
  function: TName
  begin
    Result := string.Join('.',Names.ToArray);

75459074,Google authentication using passport: Unable to force the user to pick an account again when he tries to sign-in after the first time,"I have successfully implemented authentication using gmail account in my app.
The problem is when the user signs-in again, the browser automatically picks the previous account which breaks the flow as I will explain below.   p
Based on my research, adding prompt: &quot;select_account&quot; here should have solved the issue. But, it had no effect.
router.get(
  &quot;/auth/google&quot;,
  passport.authenticate(&quot;google&quot;, {
    scope: [
      &quot;email&quot;,
      &quot;profile&quot;,
    ],
    prompt: &quot;select_account&quot;,
  })
);


Here's how automatically picking the user account that was previously used to sign-in breaks the sign-in if the user tries to sign-in again.
This is how the sign-in works:

STEP 1:

This endpoint is called from the frontend:
router.get(
  &quot;/auth/google&quot;,
  passport.authenticate(&quot;google&quot;, {
    scope: [
      &quot;email&quot;,
      &quot;profile&quot;,
    ],
    prompt: &quot;select_account&quot;,
  })
);


STEP 2:

After, the user picks an account, he is redirected to this callback endpoint:
router.get(
  &quot;/auth/google/callback&quot;,
  passport.authenticate(&quot;google&quot;, {
    failureRedirect: baseFrontendUrl,
    session: false,
  }),
  function (req, res) {
    User.findOne({ _id: req.user._id })
      .then((user) =&gt; {
        const payload = {
          id: req.user._id,
        };
        console.log(&quot;🚀 ~ file: users.js:178 ~ .then ~ payload&quot;, payload);
        jwt.sign(
          payload,
          keys.SecretKey,
          { expiresIn: 3600 * 24 * 356 },
          (error, token) =&gt; {
            if (error) {
              res.status(400).json({
                message: &quot;Error logging in user.&quot;,
              });
            } else {
              const redirect_url = `${baseFrontendUrl}/OAuthRedirecting?token=${token}`;

              res.redirect(redirect_url);
            }
          }
        );
      })
      .catch((error) =&gt; {
        res.status(500).json({
          message: &quot;An error occured authenticating user using google.&quot;,
        });
      });
  }
);

The problem is that if the user does not pick an account, he does not get redirected to that endpoint. So the second sign-in fails.
A solution to this could be to force the user to pick an account every time he signs-in but I couldn't find a way to do this.

This is how the google passport strategy is implemented:
passport.use(
  new GoogleStrategy(googe_passport_config, function (
    request,
    accessToken,
    refreshToken,
    google_profile,
    done
  ) {
    let name = !!google_profile._json.given_name
      ? google_profile.given_name
      : &quot;Name&quot;;
    let surname = !!google_profile._json.family_name
      ? google_profile.family_name
      : &quot;Surname&quot;;
    let email = !!google_profile._json.email ? google_profile.email : &quot;&quot;;

    User.findOne({ email: google_profile._json.email })
      .then((user) =&gt; {
      
        if (!!user) {
          return done(null, user);
        } else {
          userServices
            .registerUserThroughGoogleAuth(
              name,
              surname,
              email,
              google_profile.id
            )
            .then((created_user) =&gt; {
              if (!!created_user) {
                return done(null, created_user);
              }
            })
            .catch((error) =&gt; {
              const error_to_be_returned = new Error(&quot;Error creating user&quot;);
              return done(error_to_be_returned, null);
            });
        }
      })
      .catch((error) =&gt; {
        const error_to_be_returned = new Error(&quot;Error finding user&quot;);
        return done(error_to_be_returned, null);
      });
  })
);

I added some console logs there and nothing gets logged the second time the user tries to sign-in. So it's not even getting called.
","javascript, node.js, google-oauth, passport.js, google-api-nodejs-client",2,75563693,"You may try to add a random parameter to the authentication request URL to force user to select an account every time they sign in. As your prompt: &quot;select_account&quot; is not working might caused by the browser cached the user's previous login credentials and automatically signs them in without showing the select account prompt.
router.get(
  &quot;/auth/google&quot;,
  (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    req.session.google_oauth2_state = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
    next();
  },
  passport.authenticate(&quot;google&quot;, {
    scope: [&quot;email&quot;, &quot;profile&quot;],
    prompt: &quot;select_account&quot;,
    state: true,
  })
);

The random parameter will cause the browser to treat the request as a new URL, even if the user has previously signed in to your app with the same account. state: true option is set to include the state parameter in the authentication request. This is required for Google's OAuth2 protocol to prevent CSRF attacks




Another workaround is to combine select_account and consent to force the account selection page to show. Your select_account is not working could be that the browser may have cached the user's previous login credentials and automatically signs them in without showing the select account prompt. Adding the consent would force the user to select their account every time they sign in and will also ask for the user's permission again.
router.get(
  &quot;/auth/google&quot;,
  passport.authenticate(&quot;google&quot;, {
    scope: [
      &quot;email&quot;,

How can I make this work?
InheritsB1 is a subclass of B, so list[InheritsB1] is always a list of B. How can I tell mypy that it's not incompatible? Or, how can I tell mypy that the prop in A is &quot;list of B or any specific subclass of B&quot;?
I understand the issue here: mypy trouble with inheritance of objects in lists. But in this case I want the prop object to be a list of a specific instances (B or any subclass of B). I know it will never be mixed, as in it will always be list[B] or list[SubclassOfB1] or list[SubclassOfB2], never list[SubclassOfB1 | SubclassOfB2]. How can I do this?
","python, type-hinting, mypy, python-typing",0,75308953,"You linked a post that essentially addresses the issue, but you seem to still be confused:

InheritsB1 is a subclass of B, so list[InheritsB1] is always a list of B.

This is not true. To quote from this section of PEP 484:

By default generic types are considered invariant in all type variables

The theory section on variance in PEP 483 attempts to explain the concepts in much greater detail. I suggest you read through PEP 483 as well as PEP 484, if you want to get more serious about type safety.
The mypy complaint is justified and unless you want to follow the tip provided by mypy and change the type to something covariant like Sequence instead, you will have to work a bit more with generics yourself.

How best to solve your particular conundrum depends on other factors around your classes that are still ambiguous in your original post.
But one option might be to make A generic in terms of a type variable that has an upper bound of B. Then, if you want to define a subclass of A to hold elements of a specific subtype of B, there would be no problem:
from typing import Generic, TypeVar


_BType = TypeVar(&quot;_BType&quot;, bound=&quot;B&quot;)


class B:
    pass


class SubB(B):
    pass


class A(Generic[_BType]):
    attribute: list[_BType]


class SubA(A[SubB]):
    # attribute: list[SubB]
    ...


reveal_type(SubA().attribute)  # Revealed type is &quot;builtins.list[SubB]&quot;

Note that in this setup, you don't even have to override/annotate SubA.attribute (which is why I commented it out) because you specify the type argument for A to be SubB during inheritance, which means that SubA is no longer generic and attribute will always be inferred as list[SubB].
The code is type safe (passes mypy --strict), but it still may or may not be practical for you, depending on what other requirements you have for the classes involved. If you provide more details, I can try to amend my answer to better suit your setup.

&quot;poolItems&quot; is another script file where I call the functions that allows me to list prefab objects and get one at random. The numbers in vector 3 are coordinates of where I want the object to be instantiated in the scene and where I want it to jump to, respectively.
But it doesn't do anything nor does the console give me an error. Any ideas?

75497380,Why isn't my data not transferring between my two View Controllers using UITableViews?,"I am attempting to pass data from a the UITableView function cellForRowAt to a custom UITableViewCell. The cell constructs a UIStackView with n amount of UIViews inside of it. n is a count of items in an array and is dependent on the data that is suppose to be transferred (a count of items in that array). Something very confusing happens to me here. I have checked in the VC with the tableView that the data has successfully passed by using the following snippet of code
print(&quot;SELECTED EXERCISES: &quot;, self.selectedExercises)
cell.randomSelectedExercises = self.selectedExercises
print(&quot;PRINTING FROM CELL: &quot;, cell.randomSelectedExercise)

I can confirm that both of these print statements return non-empty arrays. So to me, this means that the custom cell has the data I require it to have. But, when I try to print out the very same array in the UITableViewCell swift file (randomSelectedExercises) , it returns empty to me. How is this possible? From what I understand, the cell works on creating the property initializers first, then 'self' becomes available. I had a previous error telling me this and to fix it, I turned my UIStackView initializer to lazy, but this is how I ended up with my current problem.
Here is the code in beginning that is relevant to the question that pertains to the table view. I have decided to present this code incase the issue is not in my cell but in my table view code:
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
        
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: &quot;RoutineTableViewCell&quot;) as! RoutineTableViewCell
        let workout = selectedWorkouts[indexPath.row]
        
        //get the information we need - just the name at this point
        let name = workout[&quot;name&quot;] as! String
        
        
        var randomInts = [Int]()
        
        //perform a query
        
        let query = PFQuery(className: &quot;Exercise&quot;)
        query.includeKey(&quot;associatedWorkout&quot;)
        //filter by associated workout
        query.whereKey(&quot;associatedWorkout&quot;, equalTo: workout)
        query.findObjectsInBackground{ (exercises, error) in
            if exercises != nil {

                //Created an array of random integers... this code is irrelevant to the question
                //Picking items from parent array. selectedExercises is a subarray
                for num in randomInts {
                    //allExercises just contains every possible item to pick from
                    self.selectedExercises.append(self.allExercises[num-1])
                }
                //now we have our selected workouts
                //Both print statements successfully print out correct information
                print(&quot;SELECTED EXERCISES: &quot;, self.selectedExercises)
                cell.randomSelectedExercises = self.selectedExercises
                print(&quot;PRINTING FROM CELL: &quot;, cell.randomSelectedExercises)

                
                
                
                //clear the arrays so we have fresh ones through each iteration
                self.selectedExercises.removeAll(keepingCapacity: false)
                self.allExercises.removeAll(keepingCapacity: false)
            } else {
                print(&quot;COULD NOT FIND WORKOUT&quot;)
            }
            
        }
        //***This works as expected - workoutName is visible in cell***
        cell.workoutName.text = name
        
        
        //clear the used arrays
        self.allExercises.removeAll(keepingCapacity: false)
        self.selectedExercises.removeAll(keepingCapacity: false)
        
        return cell
    }

Below is the code that gives me a problem in the cell swift file. the randomSelectedExercise does not have any data in it when I enter this area. This is an issue because in my for loop I am iterating from 1 to randomSelectedExercise.count. If this value is 0, I receive an error. The issue is focused in the UIStackView initializer:

Why is my data not properly transferring? How do I make my data transfer properly?

Edit
I believe I understand the problem better now thanks to @DonMag, so thank you very much. My data is not transferring properly because I am initializing my custom cell (creating the UILabel, UIStackView, randomSelectedExercise) with the default values I have given it. Then I am trying to update randomSelectedExercise afterwards, which will do me no good with my current code for stackView.
In respect to this, I have made a couple of changes and have omitted my background query as I felt it overcomplicated things for me. In my parse database, I have added the attribute associatedExercises to my Workout class. This attribute will contain an array of PFObjects of all the exercises associated with the working. At the beginning of this process, I have access to the selectedWorkouts which I iterate through when creating each cell in my table view, which is simply called workout in my cellForRowAt function. Following this, I extract the associated workouts data and put it into allExercises array. This is all I have changed since the initial question.
For full transparency, I will be pasting the entire code from the two files in question, followed with the questions I have now:

In my console, the print statements in lazy var stackView appear before any of the print statements in cellForRowAt because I initialize cell before these print statement. This is the issue DonMag I think was trying to point out to me but I do not understand how to switch the order of these outcomes. If I can do so, I'm guessing that information will pass to the cell correctly? Also, I have thought of doing
cell.randomSelectedExercises = self.selectedExercises before let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: &quot;RoutineTableViewCell&quot;) as! RoutineTableViewCell but obviously the namespace cell has not been created yet.
Please let me know how to solve this. I am at a complete roadblock...
","ios, swift, uitableview",0,75500650,"Here is what you're doing in your cellForRowAt func...
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
    
    // get a cell instance
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: &quot;RoutineTableViewCell&quot;) as! RoutineTableViewCell

    // ... misc stuff
    
    // start a background process
    query.findObjectsInBackground { (exercises, error) in
        // nothing here will happen yet... it happens in the background
    }
    
    // ... misc stuff
    
    return cell
    
    // at this point, you have returned the cell
    //  and your background query is doing its work

}

So you instantiate the cell, set the text of a label, and return it.
The cell creates the stack view (with an empty randomSelectedExercises) and does its other init /setup tasks...
And then - after your background find objects task completes, you set the randomSelectedExercises.
What you most likely want to do is run the queries while you are generating your array of &quot;workout&quot; objects.
Then you will already have your &quot;random exercises&quot; array as part of the &quot;workout&quot; object in cellForRowAt.

Edit
This is a fairly common program flow...

at the beginning of viewDidLoad()

setup the UI
set the table view's datasource and delegate
register the cell class


at the end of viewDidLoad()

add a UIActivityIndicatorView - a &quot;spinner&quot; - probably on top of your table view
start the spinner animating
call an async / background func to retrieve your data



When the background func has finished retrieving the data:

stop the spinner animation (hide it)
call .reloadData() on the table view

You're also confusing yourself on how to create and populate the stack view (list of exercises) in your cell. Right now you're trying to &quot;populate&quot; the stack view when it's created ... but at that point, the cell has no data to do so.
Instead, when you initialize your cell:

create / add / constrain subviews (title label and stack view)

in cellForRowAt, you would:

assign the data to the cell and then populate the &quot;rows&quot; in the stack view.

It is a little tough to help you any further without a better description of what you're trying to do... What are your data structures? Are you retrieving the &quot;exercises&quot; from your Parse database? Your code shows randomSelectedExercises ... does that mean every time the table view is shown there will be different exercises for each workout? Or, are you setting exercises for each &quot;workout&quot; in that database?

Edit 2
You're still confusing yourself about how to setup your cell and how to &quot;fill&quot; it with data.
In your cell class, you create a label and add it as a subview during init:
let workoutName: UILabel = {
    let label = UILabel()
    label.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 16)
    // etc...
    return label
}()

private func commonInit() {
    contentView.addSubview(containerView)
    containerView.addSubview(workoutName)
    containerView.addSubview(stackView)
    // etc...
}

Notice that you did NOT try to set the text of the label yet -- because you have no data for the cell at that point.
So, you're sort-of doing the same thing with your stack view, but you're trying to fill it with data when you create it.
What you want to do is create your stack view empty and then populate it when you get the data:
class RoutineTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {
    var randomSelectedExercises = [PFObject]() {
        didSet {
            // populate your stack view here

By the way, you absolutely do NOT want to be running a query inside cellForRowAt. It will run every time you need a cell... including running again and again when you scroll cells in and out of view.
You need to setup your data structure so you can:

query your db for ALL exercises
query your db for Workouts
loop through the Workouts and assign the random associated exercises

and then reload the table view. Now in cellForRowAt all you'll be doing is setting the workoutName.text and the randomSelectedExercises.
Now, as a side note... in this question (and your other, related questions), you've never explained or shown us what your ultimate goal is. Based on the information you've provided so far, I would probably tell you this would be much easier (and more flexible) if it was implemented as a multiple-section table view (where each &quot;workout&quot; is a section) rather than this approach.

Provide StringComparison parameter so they are equivalent:

I've looked all over the internet and found a way to make a list of tuples (I think), but couldn't manage to pick a random element from that list.
This is what I tried:
List&lt;Tuple&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; legalMoves; // To make the list of tuples

// Later on in a double for-loop that iterates through all the rows and columns of the 2D-array I check if that certain row and column combination is a legal move and then add it to the list like so:

legalMoves.Add(Tuple.Create(row, col));

//Then in a different method I try to pick a random element from that list (this doesn't work)

Random random = new Random();
int randomIndex = random.Next(legalMoves.Count);
(int, int) randomMove = legalMoves[randomIndex];

Users of previous versions of GRDB can use the previous answer below:

The supported methods for enabling FTS5 are documented at Enabling FTS5 Support: CocoaPods, or a custom SQLite build.
FTS5 support can not be achieved in the main repo with SPM, because SPM can't enable features depending on the target operating system (FTS5 is only iOS 11.4+, but GRDB still has a requirement on iOS 11+).
Some people fork GRDB in order to enable FTS5 with SPM. The trick is to append SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 to the Swift settings.

In a df of characters, convert them into numbers (to be used as a heat map).

I collected annotations for different genes and found that they disagree in many cases. Now I would like to visualise this as a heat map. For this, I need to convert the character vectors of the annotations into numbers.
I tried a conversation into factors but this gives me no control which char is assigned to which number. As it makes sense to control this, the factor conversion did not deliver the desired results.

Inventory
A first approach would be to have your relevant hostnames directly in your inventory:
inventory/hosts.yml
---
all:
  hosts:
    nameOfServerA.company.loc:
    nameOfServerB.company.loc:

You can then retrieve the short or full hostname for the current target with respectively {{ inventory_hostname }} and {{ inventory_hostname_short }}
target server facts
If for whatever reason you only have aliases in your inventory, or your inventory names do not match the hosts in your inventory, you can retrieve the current configured host name from the gathered facts. Of course your play needs to run with gather_facts: true (default). You can then retrieve that info for the current host in the {{ ansible_hostname }} variable
Getting the info for an other host
This is not more different that getting any other fact/var from an other host as explained for example in the playbook guide. Here is a short playbook.yml example for the above situations:
---
- name: Make sure we gather facts from all hosts in inventory
  # Note: this play is only necessary for gathering the hostname from facts.
  # Getting it from inventory does not require to gather_facts.
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true  # default so you can skip it if you want.

- name: Display hostname for serverB from serverA
  hosts: nameOfServerA.company.loc
  # Facts are already gathered
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    target: nameOfServerB.company.loc

  tasks:
    - name: &quot;Display info for {{ target }}&quot;
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg:
          - inventory_hostname is {{ hostvars[target].inventory_hostname }}
          - inventory_hostname_short is {{ hostvars[target].inventory_hostname_short }}
          - ansible_hostname is {{ hostvars[target].ansible_hostname }}

If those are special color variations, then how do I use those in my own elements manually, e.g. color=„primary-1“, primary-2.

74621685,How to download via TIdHTTP parts from multiple servers?,"Currently I use TIdHTTP in Delphi 11 to automatically download updates of my software. My installer is relatively big (about 100 MB) and the download takes a couple of minutes or even more.
Supposing I have the same installation file on different servers, is there a way to use all these servers to improve the download speed, something like Torrent does?
","delphi, indy, indy10, idhttp, http-range",0,74622715,"Torrent works by downloading separate pieces of a file from multiple sources in parallel, and then putting the pieces together into the final file.
You can do that with TIdHTTP too, if all of the servers (or even just 1 server) support the HTTP Range request header.  So, for example, you could download the file in 1KB chunks by downloading byte ranges 0-1023, 1024-2047, 2048-3071, and so on until the final chunk.
If your server(s) support that, then you can do the following:

Create a file on disk, and presize it to the total size of the final file (see How do you pre-allocate space for a file in C/C++ on Windows?).
For each piece of the file you want to download:

Create a TIdHTTP.
Create a TFileStream 1 to the final file, requesting and sharing read/write access/rights, and then seek it to the desired start offset for the piece in the file.
Download the piece into the TFileStream, setting the TIdHTTP.Request.Range property to 'bytes=&lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;', where start is the starting offset, and end is the ending offset, of the piece in the file.



1 UPDATE: Oh wait, I forgot that TIdHTTP (more specifically, TIdIOHandler.ReadStream()) resizes the given TStream to the size of the data being downloaded, if that size is reported by the server (which it would be in this situation).  You DON'T want that to happen when you have already presized the target file ahead of time, otherwise it will get truncated/corrupted if you download multiple TFileStreams into the same file.  So, you can't use a standard TFileStream here.  What you could do, though, is derive a new class from TFileStream and override its virtual SetSize() methods to do nothing.  That should work, I think.
Alternatively:

For each piece you want to download:

Create a TIdHTTP.
Create a TFileStream (a standard TFileStream is fine here) to a separate temp file, requesting write-only access and sharing no rights, and do not seek it.
Download the piece to the TFileStream, setting TIdHTTP.Request.Range as described above.


When all pieces are downloaded, create a new file on disk and copy the bytes of each temp file, in order, into this final file (see How do I concatenate two files into one?), and delete the temp files.

75439576,How do I get Pythonanywhere's web app to work with my new files?,"I am using Pythonanywhere to host a simple Flask web app for an academic project. The tutorial set me up with a simple flask_app.py hello world file that showed up at the url provided.
I then deleted that example file and used the bash console to import files from my project group's github repo, expecting the app to now work off of my own files rather than the hello world file. However, whenever I try to run it, I get a &quot;Something went wrong&quot; error
Apologies if a similar question has been answered before, I was unable to find it in a cursory search.
I assume that the issue here is that the server is expecting to read the exact hello world file that I deleted, and is confused because I replaced it incorrectly.
I have tried reloading the app using the reload button, changing the app's source code directory, working directory, and WSGI config file to point at the directory containing my new backend.py file, I have tried putting the contents of my files back into the original &quot;mysite&quot; folder. Still, I cannot seem to get the web app to work as it did with that hello world file.
I know I must be missing something stupid. Do I perhaps need to specify the name of the python file I want the url to be connected to? If so, where? Am I missing something basic in my python file?
Below is some info that may be helpful. The Error log shows that some file cant find a module, however I have no idea what file is throwing this error, how to fix it, or what I did to cause this.
Thanks for your help.

75449068,Svelte giving warning for additional class selector on :global(),"I am using SCSS in my sveltekit +layout.svelte file to create a global stylesheet. I couldn't find a built-in way to make a global stylesheet so I resorted to just using :global(). This is the code I used:

(note: :where() is used because :global() doesn't support multiple selectors)
The first rule of &amp;:not works fine, but the second rule of &amp;.dropcap shows a warning in the terminal of unused selector (the only content that will match it would go in the &lt;slot /&gt; of layout) and it gets removed from the css output.

74950277,How can I set a default value from useSelector (React-Redux) if the state is compiling too slowly?,"I'm making an educational program with React-Redux and I'm trying to make a form with items that appear and are removed sequentially. So users enter an initial observation for a reaction, click submit, the initial observation box disappears and a new button is enabled which means the user can click on a test tube and see a colour change, etc.
A useEffect function compiles an initial state for each of the reactants in question, including a value: observationStage, which starts at 1 and increases as each stage is completed. That way I can use a ternary operator so that the initial observation input disappears once it's been completed.
{(observationStage === 1) ? &lt;InitialObservation&gt; : null }

Problem was the app kept crashing. I was using useSelector to obtain the value of observationStage from the state and from what I could tell, it was demanding to know the observation stage before that part of the state had been compiled.
observationStage is a key in a parentObject. If I use useSelector to get the value of parentObject and log it to the console, it logs all the keys and values, including observationStage: 1, but if I console.log parentObject.observationStage it crashes.
So I've done this:
const observationStage = () =&gt; {
if (!parentObject){
return 1;
} else {
return parentObject.observationStage;
}

That's working, but now I need similar logic in a sibling component and obviously I don't want to just repeat the same code. I could make a module just for the bit written above and import that to both the components that need it (so far), but it just feels so cumbersome.
I'd really appreciate if anyone could see a glaring problem with my approach and set me straight. Thanks in advance.

","javascript, reactjs, redux, useselector",1,74951507,"
I was using useSelector to obtain the value of observationStage from the state and from what I could tell, it was demanding to know the observation stage before that part of the state had been compiled.

So the difficulty here is that your redux state contains complex (nested) objects with unknown keys. The react components expect the individual keys of these metal/reactant objects to be present to work properly.
The code you have in your useEffect is already part of the solution:
// An empty or &quot;initial&quot; object that doesn't contain anything meaningful but mimics the expected structure sufficiently.
const getEmptyReactant = () =&gt; ({
    observationStage: 1,
    initial: {
        input: '',
        logged: ''
    },
    final: {
        input: '',
        logged: ''
    }
});

const selectReactant = (metal) =&gt; state.reactantsToObserve[metal] ? state.reactantsToObserve[metal] : getEmptyReactant();

This should be enough of a basis to refactor your code in a way that eliminates the problem. The gist here is that these kind of state shape issues need to be solved in the redux layer. The react components should do as little as possible and leave the work up to selector functions.

75679966,Sync to physics change in godot 4,"I am in the process of converting my game from godot 3 to godot 4.
Previously in godot 3 when I was using rotating platforms, my player would sink a few pixels into the rotating platforms while they were moving up, and hover a few pixels above when the platforms were moving down. I fixed this by turning on sync to physics on the moving platform(s).
Now the problem is back, and there is no sync to physics option.
I was just wondering if this was an easy fix? Or should I redo the moving platform system entirely?
Thanks.
","game-engine, game-development, godot",4,75680352,"The recommended Node for moving platforms in Godot 3.x was KinematicBody (2D) with motion/sync_to_physics set to true.
As you know, KinematicBody (2D) became CharacterBody (2D/3D) in Godot 4. However, it is no longer recommended for moving platforms. Instead the recommended Node for moving platforms is AnimatableBody (2D/3D) which has a sync_to_physics property which does what you want.
Thus, your fix is to change the type of the node to AnimatableBody (2D/3D) and make sure the sync_to_physics property is set to true (which is the default).
And yes, an AnimatableBody (2D/3D) is an StaticBody (2D/3D). I assure you it makes sense form the standpoint of the engine design, and also that it was a subject of endless debate (in particular if StaticBody (2D/3D) should still be called &quot;static&quot; if they sometimes are intended to move). But we failed to agree on something better. Please take it for what it is.

Does anyone have an idea how to do this, or has done something similar please?
My idea is that in React, my front end, I have a login screen directed to the external authentication service, and that the SpringBoot APIs are also secured by the external authentication service
I have a large e-commerce application, with built-in authorization OAuth server.

Each request your application in this case third party ssis google analytics connector makes to google analtics counts as a single request.
If you have a google analytics 360 account you can max make 50000 requests in an hour.
The max rows i can see on your screen shot is set to 10000 So if the request would return more then 10000 rows it will request the net page of results
Which after a bit of math
50000 * 10000 = 500.000.000 rows in total
So if your request returns more then 500,000,000 rows in an hour your going to blow out the per hour quota.
Seeing as you are using a 360 account which would be a professional website which may have a lot of data and you are using the dimension dateHour from April 2022 - today thats what ten months.   Thats what 7.200 hours

74777076,Nuxt 3 - How to refresh fetched data every n minutes,"So in my database data gets refreshed every minute(data actually updates, I checked) and then I display this data on the page. Data gets fetched when I switch between pages and when I manually refresh the page as it should, but if I sit on one page for example 5 min, data does not get refreshed on the page side even tho data updates in the database.
Is it possible to refresh fetch data let's say every minute when user is active on page, without hitting refresh button all the time?
I fetch data using useFetch(), but I don't use any additional parameters because I don't need them. In documentation specifically says, that params have to change in order to get refresh work.
var {data: fixture, refresh, pending, error} = await useFetch('/api/getFixture')``

I've tried something like that:
function refreshing(){
  refresh
  console.log(&quot;refreshing&quot;)
}
setInterval(() =&gt; refreshing(), 10000);

The function gets executed but the data does not refresh because if I understand correctly, there was no change in params right?
I also tried using:
refreshNuxtData()

which should &quot;execute&quot; fetch again, but no luck either.
Thank you and best regards,

As already mentioned in other answer, if you know the primary keys of the entities that you want to delete, you can construct empty entities with IDs without querying and call DbContext.RemoveRange(entities);

If you know what you're doing and are confident in the quality of your inputs: use ExecuteSqlRaw and just remove the objects you want manually this way: DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(&quot;DELETE FROM PictureItems WHERE ...&quot;);
Use a (commercial) extension library that supports bulk-delete on EF Core.

Tried different locators, but it seems that I am missing something!  I am using Selenium to scrape the staff names &amp; emails from this simple html page. However, my code is skipping a lot and return just few data points. I'm not sure why?
","python-3.x, selenium-webdriver, web-scraping",0,75381376,"I think you're going to have a hard time scraping contact information from that page if you want both names and email addresses. There are at least three different ways contacts are presented in that document, along with a few outliers.
Getting just a list of email address is trivial:
matches = driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//a[contains(@href, &quot;mailto:&quot;)]')
all_emails = set(x.get_attribute(&quot;href&quot;) for x in matches)

For extracting both names and addresses, I came up with something like this:
import selenium.common.exceptions
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options


options = Options()
options.add_argument(&quot;--headless&quot;)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
url = &quot;https://www.brickschools.org/bths/home-default/departments/#1624628243020-4e557b29-3c1a&quot;  # 1494
driver.get(url)
all_contacts = {}

# This is a list of pattern specifications. The &quot;match&quot; key is an XPath
# expression that identifies a top-level element that contains both the name
# and email address. The &quot;name&quot; and &quot;email&quot; keys are callables that when
# evaluated on the matched element return the desired data.
patterns = [
    {
        &quot;match&quot;: &quot;//tr[(td/strong) and (td/a[contains(@href, 'mailto:')])]&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(&quot;td/strong&quot;).get_attribute(
            &quot;textContent&quot;
        ),
        &quot;email&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(&quot;td/a&quot;).get_attribute(&quot;href&quot;),
    },

    {
        &quot;match&quot;: &quot;//tr[td/table//a[contains(@href, 'mailto:')]]&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(&quot;td//strong&quot;).get_attribute(
            &quot;textContent&quot;
        ),
        &quot;email&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(&quot;td//td/a&quot;).get_attribute(
            &quot;href&quot;
        ),
    },

    {
        &quot;match&quot;: &quot;//div[span/a[contains(@href, 'mailto')]]&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(
            &quot;./preceding-sibling::div[1]/span&quot;
        ).get_attribute(&quot;textContent&quot;),
        &quot;email&quot;: lambda ele: ele.find_element_by_xpath(&quot;span/a&quot;).get_attribute(&quot;href&quot;),
    },
]

matches = driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//a[contains(@href, &quot;mailto:&quot;)]')
all_emails = set(x.get_attribute(&quot;href&quot;) for x in matches)
print(f&quot;expecting {len(all_emails)} contacts&quot;)

for patternSpec in patterns:
    matches = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(patternSpec[&quot;match&quot;])
    for match in matches:
        try:
            c_name = patternSpec[&quot;name&quot;](match)
            c_email = patternSpec[&quot;email&quot;](match)
        except selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException:
            # if we fail to process something, just skip it and move on
            continue

        all_contacts[c_name] = c_email

print(f&quot;found {len(all_contacts)} contacts&quot;)
print(&quot;missing:&quot;, all_emails.difference(all_contacts.values()))

Running this code produces:
expecting 112 contacts
found 110 contacts
missing: {'mailto:cpazmino+FromWWW@...', 'mailto:dstjean+FromWWW@...'}

So it works, mostly. Those two outliers are contained inside an
additional &lt;h5&gt; element, and we could probably adjust the existing
expression to work with these, but I've run out of steam.

","sql, r, sf, geopackage",0,74940560,"Your approach feels reasonable; it is somewhat difficult to troubleshoot it without having access to your actual dataset, but we can do with the world geopackage that ships with {spData} package.
The my first step would be to check the names of layers stored in your geopackage; this will tell you what are legitimate tables to which you can point your WHERE clause.
The second step is running your actual read operation; while sf::st_read() and sf::read_sf() are in principle the same thing - they differ only in defaults for some of the optional parameters - I suggest to use sf::st_read() when in doubt.
In instances of troubleshooting it is also a good idea to assign your parameters explicitly, and not rely on position (dsn should be the first argument by position, but having it assigned by name is bulletproof).
library(sf)

# a GPKG dataset - it lives in spData package
world_dataset &lt;- system.file(&quot;shapes/world.gpkg&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;)

While I believe that reasoneable people can differ in their opinion whether Russian Federation or French Guiana actually belong to Europe the SQL query on technical level clearly works.

75642280,Synchronously Wait on TaskCompletionSource.Task,"Sync-over-async is bad. I know. But is there a sync-over-async problem when calling TaskCompletionSource.Task.Wait()? Does the answer changes if TaskCompletionSource was created with TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously?
Update
To answer the questions from the comments. Not all Task's are equal. The Task object was introduced long before async/await and was used for parallel programming. For example, there is nothing wrong with the following code as it doesn't do any async work.
var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; Thread.Sleep(10_000));
task.Wait();

For the context: The Kafka client has a sync method to produce messages which accepts an action to report delivery status asynchronously
void Produce(
      TopicPartition topicPartition,
      Message&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; message,
      Action&lt;DeliveryReport&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt; deliveryHandler = null);

See the WaitForDeliveryReport method implementation.
Now the question is much longer but I hope it will help people to understand the reason behind it.
","c#, asynchronous, task, taskcompletionsource",-1,75643378,"Initializing the TaskCompletionSource with the TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously option means that the Task will be completed on the ThreadPool, and not on the thread that called the TrySetException method. This is useful in case that the Task is awaited, so that the completion thread is not hijacked by the continuation(s) after the await. Having your thread &quot;stolen&quot; after calling SetResult is a common cause of bugs in asynchronous programming. It is something highly unexpected by most programmers, before they experience it for the first time (usually at the finale a long and unpleasant debugging session).
But in case that the Task is Waited synchronously, completing it on the ThreadPool offers no advantage. The continuation after the Wait will run on the waiting thread, and not on the completing thread. All that the completing thread will have to do is to signal an internal ManualResetEventSlim, which is a negligible amount of work.
So you should avoid initializing the TaskCompletionSource with this option, if you intend to Wait it synchronously. Doing so not only adds overhead for no reason, but also risks the delayed completion of the task, in case the ThreadPool is saturated. In extreme cases it's even possible for a complete deadlock to occur, in case the ThreadPool is saturated and has reached its maximum size.

I tried these 2 methods but they are failing.

const app = () =&gt; import(&quot;@/constants/app.&quot; + process.env.NODE_ENV + &quot;.js&quot;);

Last one is not failing but output is something different.
In the picture app is my actual js file.
app1 is when I use const app = () =&gt; import(&quot;@/constants/app.&quot; + process.env.NODE_ENV + &quot;.js&quot;);

By manually editing now we can access GitLab without any issues but the problem is that this is a manual fix we added so every time a pipeline will do a deployment this will be reset in place.
The issue is that we looked for adding custom headers to overwrite the [nginx.conf](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/customization/custom-headers/ is not overwriting the normal nginx.conf configuration) but after adding a ConfigMap with the specific things or just adding similar annotations like this to the Ingress of the nginx-ingress controller or to the ConfigMap:

75428138,"What am I doing wrong trying to rotate some SVG through an animateTransform tag with ""spline"" calcmode?","I'm trying to animate a triangle so that its rotation accelerates (and later comes to a stop after a full rotation) and I am trying to use the animateTransform SVG tag, with the calcmode attribute set to &quot;spline&quot;.. I can easily get the triangle to rotate with a continuous motion, but it's not the smooth acceleration I'm looking for.

&lt;/svg&gt;



What am I doing wrong? Should I use CSS animations instead? Any kind of non-continuous rotation would be a win.
I tried various value combinations for the keyTimes / keySplines attributes, but the only result I got was a continuous rotation - for example, with

    keyTimes=&quot;0; 1&quot;
    keySplines=&quot;0.5 0 0.5 1&quot;

For animations specified with a ‘values’ list, the ‘keyTimes’ attribute if specified must have exactly as many values as there are in the ‘values’ attribute. For from/to/by animations, the ‘keyTimes’ attribute if specified must have two values.

monthlyPlayerData is like below.

No matter what I do, I am getting the TS error `'monthlyPlayerData' is possibly 'undefined'

The monthlyPlayerData value comes from API response so before the call finishes, it may be undefined. Also, you haven't provided a default value when setting the state.
useState&lt;MonthlyPlayerData&gt;(); // no default value for &quot;monthlyPlayerData&quot;

You could use optional chaining to secure the possibility that monthlyPlayerData is undefined.
monthlyPlayerData?.hours_played
          // ^^^^^^^^ optional chaining

public Employees(MainWindow mw)

}

Create a null object for your MainWindow , than give a parameter to your Page method , then in the method , you declare the MainWindow like I show you in the code.
After you done with this , then you need to go to the MainWindow.xaml.cs and you have to do this:
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    employees = new Employees(this);
    Presenter.Content = employees;
}

Employees employees = null;

Create a null object for your Page , and in the MainWindow method you have to declare the Page like this.
After that , you just need a Loaded and an Unloaded event to your page :
private void Page_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    mw.EmployeesButton.Background = (Brush)new BrushConverter().ConvertFrom(&quot;#006B60&quot;);
}

private void Page_Unloaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    mw.EmployeesButton.Background = (Brush)new BrushConverter().ConvertFrom(&quot;#009688&quot;);
}

You can use any color you want , I hope its helps :D

74713371,Weird behavior with NavigationSplitView and @State,"I have a NavigationSplitView in my app, I have an @State variable in my detail view that gets created in init.
When I select something from the sidebar and the detail view renders, at first everything looks ok. But when I select a different item on the sidebar, the contents of the @state variable don't get recreated.
Using the debugger I can see the init of the detail view get called every time I select a new item in the sidebar, and I can see the @State variable get created. But when it actually renders, the @State variable still contains the previous selection's values.
I've reduced this problem to a test case I'll paste below. The top text in the detail view is a variable passed in from the sidebar, and the second line of text is generated by the @State variable. Expected behavior would be, if I select &quot;one&quot; the detail view would display &quot;one&quot; and &quot;The name is one&quot;. If I select &quot;two&quot; the detail view would display &quot;two&quot; and &quot;The name is two&quot;.
Instead, if I select &quot;one&quot; first, it displays correctly. But when I select &quot;two&quot;, it displays &quot;two&quot; and &quot;The name is one&quot;.
Note that if I select &quot;two&quot; as the first thing I do after launching the app, it correctly displays &quot;two&quot; and &quot;The name is two&quot;, but when I click on &quot;one&quot; next, it will display &quot;one&quot; and &quot;the name is two&quot;. So the state variable is being set once, then never changing again,
Here's the sample code and screenshots:
import SwiftUI

struct Item: Hashable, Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var selectedItem: Item.ID? = nil
    
    private let items = [Item(name: &quot;one&quot;), Item(name: &quot;two&quot;), Item(name: &quot;three&quot;)]
    
    func itemForID(_ id: UUID?) -&gt; Item? {
        guard let itemID = id else { return nil }
        return items.first(where: { item in
            item.id == itemID
        })
    }

                DetailView(name: name)
            } else {
                Text(&quot;Select an item&quot;)
            }
        }
    }

    }
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(name)
            Text(detailItem.computedText)

",swiftui,5,75174438,"This has nothing to do with NavigationSplitView, but how you initialise @State property.
According to the Apple document on @State (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state):

Don’t initialise a state property of a view at the point in the view hierarchy where you instantiate the view, because this can conflict with the storage management that SwiftUI provides.

As well as the documentation of init(wrappedValue:) (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state/wrappedvalue):

Don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, declare a property with the State attribute, and provide an initial value:

@State private var isPlaying: Bool = false

From my understanding, if you force to initialise the state in the view init, it will persist through the lifetime of the view, and subsequence change of it won't take any effect on the view.
The recommended way in Apple documentation is to create the struct in the parent view and pass it to the child view, and if you need to change the struct in the child view, use @Binding to allow read and write access.
If you want to ignore the documentation and force it to work, you can give an id to your DetailView, forcing it to refresh the view when the item id has changed:
var body: some View {
    NavigationSplitView{
        List(selection: $selectedItem) {
            ForEach(items) { item in
                Text(item.name)
                    .tag(item.id)
            }
        }
    } detail: {
        if let name = itemForID(selectedItem)?.name {
            DetailView(name: name).id(selectedItem)
        } else {
            Text(&quot;Select an item&quot;)
        }
    }

75627568,Change how JSX curly braces evaluates an Object/Class Instance,"I have the following snippet of code:
import React from 'https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0'
import jsxToString from &quot;https://cdn.skypack.dev/jsx-to-string@1.4.0&quot;;

class T extends Function {
  foo;
  constructor(foo) {
    super();
    this.foo = foo;
    
    return new Proxy(this, {
      apply: (target) =&gt; target._call()

const el2 = (&lt;div&gt;{a()}&lt;/div&gt;);
const el3 = (&lt;div&gt;{a}&lt;/div&gt;);

&quot;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&quot;

I know this is weird but long story short, I need to be able to represent my a object the same way however I pass it through JSX curly braces.
{`${a}`} =&gt; calls toString OK
{a()} =&gt; calls _call OK
{a} =&gt; KO, I suspect that this syntax does something like eval(a) so it end up failing.
Is there a way to force how an object is evaluated when passed through JSX curly braces?
I am open to any suggestion, I don't care about performance or anything, think of it as a proof of concept.
The only requirement is that I can't change the JSX syntax.
","javascript, reactjs, jsx",0,75637954,"I think this is not possible.
There are no &quot;instance getters&quot; in javascript. I.e. you can write getters for properties,
but not for the object itself.
JSX evaluation
The code between the curly braces in JSX is just normal javascript code
(i.e. no eval() is happening or something).
Your JSX code will be converted to plain javascrip:
const el1 = React.createElement( &quot;div&quot;, null, `${a}` );
const el2 = React.createElement( &quot;div&quot;, null, a() );
const el3 = React.createElement( &quot;div&quot;, null, a );

React elements
The 3rd parameter of createElement is
expected to be a React node, i.e. a React element, string, number and some others.
So you would need to e.g. make a be a React element,
which can also be called as a function, and you'd need to overwrite it's
toString method, but React elements are not extensible, so that is no option.
In fact, React states this explicitly:

You must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never
change their contents after creation

74746284,Jacoco coverage over ternary operations,"I faced a frustrating problem with jacoco and ternary operations in Java.
Context:
I have a function which take a List&lt;String&gt;. The max filters this list can have is 10 and they can be set or not. I choosed to do ternary to fill the filters string.
In my JUnit test, I call twice this function: once with 10 filters and once with none. However, jacoco is still telling me that 1 of 2 branches is missed.
I voluntarily changed the names / returns of my functions to show only the global scheme
public void functionToTest(List&lt;String&gt; filters){
    String p0 = filters.get(0);
    String p1 = filters.size() &gt;= 2 ? filters.get(1) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p2 = filters.size() &gt;= 3 ? filters.get(2) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p3 = filters.size() &gt;= 4 ? filters.get(3) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p4 = filters.size() &gt;= 5 ? filters.get(4) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p5 = filters.size() &gt;= 6 ? filters.get(5) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p6 = filters.size() &gt;= 7 ? filters.get(6) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p7 = filters.size() &gt;= 8 ? filters.get(7) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p8 = filters.size() &gt;= 9 ? filters.get(8) : &quot;&quot;;
    String p9 = filters.size() &gt;= 10 ? filters.get(9) : &quot;&quot;;
    
    // Do stuff with filters
}

@Test
public void testFunction() {
    List&lt;String&gt; filters = //instantiate 10 strings

    // First call with no filters
    functionToTest(Collections.emptyList());

    // Second call with filters
    functionToTest(filters);
}


Here is the result of jacoco saying &quot;1 of 2 branches missed&quot; on yellow lines:

So my question is: Is there a way to &quot;bypass&quot; or to deal with ternary operations and jacoco ?
NB: I already know how to solve the coverage but it is ugly, see:
String p1 = &quot;&quot;
if (filters.size() &gt;=2) {
    p1 = filters.get(1);
}
// etc...

75885213,How to increase asyncio thread limits in an existing co-routine,"I am currently working on a program using concurrency with asyncio.
The code here is over simplified in order to show the problem.
It is runnable without any dependencies if you need so.
You have two tasks levels:

1: One in operation_loop which creates asyncio workers.
2: One in worker which calls synchronous functions with blockings points, and requests to db (simulated here with time.sleep). keep in mind that custom_sleep function is in reality a complex job with blocking parts: that's why it is in a thread. it is alimented by a queue.

The queue is elimented each second.



But it seems that asyncio.to_thread can handle 20 threads at max, so, everything is fine with one worker and 20 threads, but the gather operation time is doubled when using 21 threads. And so on with 61... Is we add a worker, we are still limited to 20 threads.

I have seen that I can use a concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecuter context manager with a max_worker value, but I want to stick with asyncio as much as possible. (except if there is no other options).
Another option could be to fully convert in asyncio the code but it should take some time to do.
Another option could be to use multiprocess but it seems to be an overkill for now.
Do you have an idea of why the threads are limited? And how to increase this limit?
Thank you in advance
","python, multithreading, concurrency, python-asyncio",0,75887038,"The asyncio function to_thread is actually a wrapper around ThreadPoolExecutor.  Here is its code after removing some details that don't concern this question (from asyncio.thread.py, Python3.11):
loop = events.get_running_loop()
return await loop.run_in_executor(None, func_call)

Here func_call is basically the function that you passed to to_thread.  When None is the first argument, the default ThreadPoolExecutor is used.  So even though you said you didn't want to use ThreadPoolExecutor, you are doing so in fact.  And you are using the default one.
Now here is a snippet from the documentation for ThreadPoolExecutor:
&quot;If max_workers is None or not given, it will default to the number of processors on the machine, multiplied by 5.&quot;
So you see that this will limit the number of threads, in your case to 20.  You can define a ThreadPoolExecutor with a higher thread limit and set that using the function asyncio.loop.set_default_executor. https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html?highlight=threadpoolexecutor#asyncio.loop.set_default_executor
Try adding these 2 lines at the beginning of operation_loop:
async def operation_loop():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    loop.set_default_executor(ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=40))

Subsequent calls to to_thread will now use an executor with a thread limit of 40.
I hope you realize that Python threads do not actually run in parallel.  Python switches between threads rapidly to give the appearance of parallelism.  Your test code, using the sleep function, does not illustrate this situation.  In your real program this might be very important.
If you need true parallel processing you must create separate Python Processes.

My SQLITE DB has a Timestamp column and it's data type is datetime and stores the timestamp as 2023-09-01 00:00:00.
What I'm trying to do is get the MAX date of the latest snowfall. For example, with my seasonal years beginning July-01 (earliest) and ending June 30 (latest), I want to find only the latest (MAX) date snowfall was recorded, regardless of the year, based on the month.
Say if out of five years (2017 to 2022) worth of data in the database and it snowed Mar 15, 2020. And there was no date greater than than this one in any year, then this would be the latest date regardless which year it fell.
I've been trying many variations of the below query. This query says it runs with no mistakes and returns &quot;null&quot; values. I'm using SQLITE DB Browser to write and test the query.
SELECT Timestamp, MAX(strftime('%m-%d-%Y', Timestamp)) AS lastDate,

I copied all the COBOL files and installed OpenCobolIDE on the new computer.
However, the IDE cannot open the file as the encoding is not correct.
Is there a simple fix? I spent the whole day playing with different IDEs but in vain. As I have zero knowledge of COBOL, if it is too difficult to migrate, I will probably write a complete new system for my dad. The one who wrote it has already retired and no one took over his job. Thank you!

To move these to the new environment: as long as the RM/COBOL runtime is 32bit: just copy it along and use it on the new computer.
If the runtime is 16bit it won't work on newer environments directly, you could try with an emulator or virtual machine (DOSBOX or FreeDOS running in VirtualBox for example).
As an alternative: if the COBOL source code is available then you could recompile it with GnuCOBOL using -std=rm-strict, allowing you to run in in 64 (or 32) bit on nearly every operating system.

74731934,How to use a struct field into another struct without referring to it as a key,"I want to insert a struct field into another struct without having to use the struct name.
I know that I can do this:
type Person struct {
  Name string
}

type User struct {
  Person
  Email, Password string
}

But It results in this struct:
user := User{Person: Person{Name: &quot;&quot;}, Email: &quot;&quot;, Password: &quot;&quot;}

How can I do something like this:
type Person struct {
  Name string
}

type User struct {
  Name Person.Name // Here
  Email, Password string
}

To use it like this
user := User{Name: &quot;&quot;, Email: &quot;&quot;, Password: &quot;&quot;}

Is it possible?
","go, struct",-2,74740086,"Simply put, with the current language implementation you can't.
When initialising a literal you need to be explicit (or, put another way: literal! [sic]).  Since a User contains a Person, a literal User must contain a literal Person, as you illustrate:
    u := User{ 
        Person: Person{
            Name: &quot;Bob&quot;,
        },
        Email: &quot;bob@bobspot.com&quot;,
        Password: &quot;you're kidding right?&quot;,
    } 

However, once you have a variable of type User, you can then leverage the anonymous field to set (or get) the Name of the anonymous Person with the User:
    u := User{}
    u.Name = &quot;Bob&quot;
    u.Email = &quot;bob@bobspot.com&quot;,
    u.Password = &quot;you're kidding right?&quot;,

Why Does Go Make Me Do All This Work?
Let us imagine that it was possible to initialise the inner Person in the way you are looking for:
    u := User{ Name: &quot;Bob&quot; }

Now let us further imagine that we later modify the User struct and add its own Name field:
    type User struct {
        Person
        Name string
        Email string
        Password string
    }

And now you can obviously initialise the new Name field:
    u := User{ Name: &quot;Bob&quot; }

Notice that this is identical to the previous code that initialised User.Person.Name but now it is initialising User.Name.  Not good.
More Gotchas
There are further traps lurking with code like this.
First, the addition of a Name field in User already similarly &quot;breaks&quot; unqualified references to Name on User variables:
    u.Name = &quot;Bob&quot; // used to set User.Person.Name, now sets User.Name

Also, with only an anonymous Person field, the User.Person.Name field is marshalled to JSON by default as a &quot;Name&quot; field:
    {
        &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;Password&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }

If a Name field is added, then this is the field that is marshalled as &quot;Name&quot; and the User.Person.Name field is not marshalled at all.
You might think you can add a json tag for the User.Person.Name, e.g.
    type User struct {
        Person   `json:&quot;PersonName&quot;`
        Name     string
        Email    string
        Password string
    }

But now the Person is marshalled as an object with a Name field:
    {
        &quot;PersonName&quot;: {
            &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;&quot;
        },
        &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;Password&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }

This also happens if you try to change the marshalled field name of the anonymous Person even if User does not have a Name field.
In short: using anonymous structs within structs as a way of &quot;adding fields&quot; is potentially problematic and fragile and should probably be avoided.

74905593,How to filter out Long Press into a webvir,"I am embedding a youtube video in an iFrame using a WebView. I am trying to avoid sending right mouse clicks to the webview and it seems long pressing a webview sends the event to show the menu.
I cant access the document of the iFrame from withing JavaScript, so I cant prevent right mouse clicks on the iFrame using JavaScript. Instead I am trying to prevent long presses from being sent to the webview. So have tried to override the webview's onTouch. It turns out the following doesn't pass the long click nor does it pass any click.
@SuppressLint(&quot;ClickableViewAccessibility&quot;)
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent motionEvent) {
   return true;
}

or
@SuppressLint(&quot;ClickableViewAccessibility&quot;)
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent motionEvent) {
   return false;
}

Adding super.onTouchEvent(motionEvent) passes all clicks to the view. So I have tried to filter out long presses in the following way
private long startTime;

@SuppressLint(&quot;ClickableViewAccessibility&quot;)
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent motionEvent) {
    if (motionEvent.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN){
        startTime = System.nanoTime();
    } else if(motionEvent.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP &amp;&amp; System.nanoTime() - startTime &lt; 19000000){
            super.onTouchEvent(motionEvent);
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Sadly this doesn't send click events if a user quickly lifts the finger after clicking.
","java, android-view, motionevent",0,74980723,"Well I managed to do it using gestures. I created an onTouchListener for the webview and set it.
How it works

The listener runs a Gesture detector and returns true every time

@Override
public boolean onTouch(View webview, MotionEvent event) {
    detector.onTouchEvent(event);
    return true;
}


The gesture detector then filters out long clicks.

@Override
public boolean onDown(MotionEvent event) {
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent event) {
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float dx, float dy) {
    return true;
}


Since sending events onDown will trigger youtube to receive long presses so instead I create down events only when I want to click or scroll like

webview.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent.obtain(
    event.getDownTime(),
    event.getEventTime(),
    MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN,
    event.getX(),
    event.getY(),
    0));

I had to actually have the down event created once on scroll by creating my own condition boolean firstScroll

Lastly I had to send an up event when all is done using the listener

class RemoteControl implements View.OnTouchListener {

    private final GestureDetector detector;
    private boolean firstScroll = true;

    public RemoteControl(WebView webview) {
        Context context = webview.getContext();
        detector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onDown(MotionEvent event) {
                return true;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent event) {
                webview.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent.obtain(
                    event.getDownTime(),
                    event.getEventTime(),
                    MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN,
                    event.getX(),
                    event.getY(),
                    0));
                webview.onTouchEvent(event);
                return true;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float dx, float dy) {
                if (firstScroll) {
                    webview.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent.obtain(

Anyone can help me?
","stock, indicator, ml.net",1,75587892,"I'm going to assume your data is organized in the following csv format:
Price,MACD,RSI,EMA,Trend
100,1.23,70.5,98.5,Up

Furthermore, I will assume your Trend Labels are pre-determined through some simple heuristic such as an EMA 200 crossover, and that a human has optionally manually validated these labels.
With this established, you can use feature selection techniques in ML.NET to help you identify the most important features in your data that impact your target variable (in this case, whether the trend is up or down).
The following is an example of how you would apply feature selection in C# using ML.NET:

var trainTestSplit = mlContext.Data.TrainTestSplit(data);

// Define your feature selection pipeline

// Train your model
var model = pipeline.Fit(trainTestSplit.TrainSet);

// Evaluate your model on the test set
var metrics = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(model.Transform(trainTestSplit.TestSet));

// Print the feature weights to see which indicators are most important
var featureWeights = model.LastTransformer.Model.GetFeatureWeights();
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Feature weights:&quot;);
foreach (var featureWeight in featureWeights)
{
    Console.WriteLine($&quot;{featureWeight.FeatureName}: {featureWeight.Weight}&quot;);
}

This example uses the Concatenate transform to combine all of our feature series into a single Features column. The SelectBestBinaryFeatures transform is then used to select the two most important features (alternatively, you can also just adjust the numberOfFeatures parameter manually as needed).
Hopefully, this helps give you a good starting point.

74877491,Is there a way to replace the arguments in a string multiple times?,"I'm declaring a string at initialisation as follows
string a = string.Format(&quot;Hello {0}&quot;, &quot;World.&quot;);

Is there a way to subsequently replace the zeroth argument for something else?
If there's no obvious solution, does anybody know of a better way to address the issue. For context, at initialisation I create a number of strings. The text needs to be updated as the program proceeds. I could create a structure comprising an array of strings and an array of objects and then build the final string as required, but this seems ugly, particularly as each instance could have a different number of arguments.
For example,
public class TextThingy
{
   List&lt;String&gt; strings;
   List&lt;String&gt; arguments;

   ...

   public string ToString()
   {
      return strings[0] + arguments [0] + strings [1] ...
   }

I've tried this, but to no avail.
string b = string.Format(a, &quot;Universe.&quot;);

I guess that the argument {0} once populated is then baked into the string that one time.
","c#, string",-1,74877554,"You could move the format string to a variable like this?

As you can see in the result, the last 4 linesGrob are resulting in the same line: On with a positive slope. How is it possible to draw from up-left to down-right?

","r, ggplot2, patchwork",1,75374413,"If you are using grob = linesGrob() without passing any arguments to linesGrob, the result will always slope upwards left-to-right, because its default x argument is set to c(0, 1) and it default y argument is set to c(0, 1) - in a sense it is just a square picture of a 45 degree line sloping upwards left-to-right. By rescaling its x and y dimensions you can convert it to anything from a horizontal to a vertical line, but it will always be upsloping left-to-right between these two extremes.
However, the x and y co-ordinates of a linesGrob can be changed to whatever you like, to draw arbitrary line shapes. The grob is drawn on whatever rectangle you set according to ymin, ymax, xmin and xmax. The coordinates you set in linesGrob represent the space within this rectangle, with x = 0, y = 0 being the bottom left corner, and x = 1, y = 1 being the top right corner.
Just change the default y values to c(1, 0), and we have a downsloping line that you can then rescale with annotation_custom:
p1 + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0,5,0,0), &quot;cm&quot;)) +

75881502,"How can I reverse direction of Plotly's Colorbar, so that small values at top and large values at bottom","I'm currently using the colorbar on plotly to indicate the depths at which underwater SONAR receivers have been placed. Currently, the colorbar looks like this:

However, I think it would make more sense if the bigger values, which indicate greater depth, should be at the bottom and the smaller numbers, which indicate less depth (i.e. the device has been placed closer to surface) should be at the top, but don't know how to do this.
The code I've used to create the graph and colorbar consists of the two dictionaries (one specifying data, the other specifying layout).

What argument should I add (probably to the colorbar dictionary in the data dictionary) to have the numbers representing greater depth at the bottom of the colorbar?
","python, plotly, plotly-python",5,75883703,"You can reverse the colorscale, then hardcode the tickvals by passing tickvals = [1, 1.1, ... 3.4], and make the ticktext the opposite: ticktext = ['3.4', '3.3', ... '1']. This will also require you to manually add the text &quot; log(meters, 10)&quot; to the topmost tick.
I am not sure why, but there's this strange behavior where the tickvals and ticktext are getting cut off at the top and bottom – you may need to adjust some of the tick starting and ending values. It may have to do with the default padding for colorbars, or perhaps I missed something.

Maybe there is another way to change content of it using vanilla JS.
JS:
const score = document.querySelector(&quot;.score1&quot;);

HTML:
&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-none score1&quot; data-bs-container=&quot;body&quot; data-bs-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-bs-placement=&quot;bottom&quot; data-bs-content=&quot;Chance: 1 to 13 983 816&quot; data-bs-trigger=&quot;hover&quot;&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;

Not so important line - just gives back a number from range of 0-6.
let x = randomArray.filter((n) =&gt; validArray.includes(n)).length;
    console.log(x);

The JS switch itself works just fine but the content is changing only in the code.
    switch (x) {
      case 6:
        score.setAttribute(&quot;data-bs-content&quot;, &quot;Chance: 1 to 13 983 816&quot;);

      case 0:

    }

    score.innerHTML = `You guessed ${x} numbers.`;

74916407,Can C++ projects/libraries that have external dependencies be configured to work right off the bat?,"I'm a beginner to C++, and I was recently figuring out the process of downloading an external library and linking it to a project I'm working on. Coming from languages where adding new dependencies and installing necessary ones are a command away, it seems that there are several ways to download and link a library in C++, and so I'm struggling to imagine how experienced developers with large scale projects are able to make their scripts and libraries portable and straightforward to setup.
To give an example, what I ended up doing in my project was using a CMakeLists.txt file with a hardcoded path to a library I'm using, libxml2, something like this:
include_directories(/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxml2/2.10.3_1/include);
link_directories(/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxml2/2.10.3_1/lib);

But this would require libxml2 to be separately downloaded onto every machine this project is cloned on, and the path would change too depending on the version and environment. So my specific question is, what is considered best practice to package C++ projects with external dependencies?
For example, node.js has a package.json and npm install, python has a requirement.txt and pip install -r requirements.txt. Is there a C++ equivalent?
I'm sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm really struggling finding the right search terms to find a proper answer. Thank you in advance!
","c++, standards, libraries, external-dependencies",3,74916485,"I personally just use git modules with the dependencies as part of my repository, so when someone checks it out, he/she can also pull all source code required to build/link the required dependencies.
Fortunately many popular libraries are themselves built with CMake, so you don't have to do anything fancy to add them into your CMake project. Modules also refer to specific commit of the dependency repo and it helps to maintain consistent dependency version between contributors.
E.g. here is how file structure looks like in one of my projects (I got rid of some details which are not directly linked to the quesiton):
|-- CMakeLists.txt
|-- CMakeSettings.json
|-- README.md
|-- assets
|   |-- assets-files
|-- lib
|   |-- CMakeLists.txt
|   |-- libTwo
|   |-- libThree
|   `-- libFour
`-- src
    |-- source-files

Each subfolder in the lib is a separate submodule in my repo. In the root CMakeLists.txt I merely add this folder with my dependencies with a single line of configuration:
add_subdirectory(lib)

While the CMakeLists.txt in the lib folder takes care of the rest:
add_compile_options(-w)
# Lib One
find_package(libOne REQUIRED)
list(APPEND LIB_TARGETS ${LIB_ONE_LIBRARIES})
list(APPEND LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS ${LIB_ONE_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Lib Two
add_subdirectory(libTwo)
list(APPEND LIB_TARGETS libTwo)
list(APPEND LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libTwo/include&quot;)

# Lib Three
add_subdirectory(libThree)
list(APPEND LIB_TARGETS libThreeProj)
list(APPEND LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libThree/include&quot;)

# Lib Four
add_subdirectory(libFour)
list(APPEND LIB_TARGETS libFour)

if(LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS)
        list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS)
        target_include_directories(${PROJ_NAME} PRIVATE ${LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS})
        if(MSVC)
                target_compile_options(${PROJ_NAME} PRIVATE
                        &quot;$&lt;$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:Clang&gt;:SHELL:-Xclang -isystem$&lt;JOIN:${LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS}, -Xclang -isystem&gt;&gt;&quot;
                        &quot;$&lt;$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC&gt;:SHELL:-experimental:external -external:W0 -external:anglebrackets -external:I$&lt;JOIN:${LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS}, -external:I&gt;&gt;&quot;)
        else()
                target_compile_options(${PROJ_NAME} PRIVATE &quot;SHELL:-isystem $&lt;JOIN:${LIB_INCLUDE_DIRS}, -isystem&gt;&quot;)
        endif()
endif()

target_link_libraries(${PROJ_NAME} PRIVATE ${LIB_TARGETS})

You may notice that I also keep other dependencies (i.e. libOne in this case) that can be found with find_package in the same place, and it's neatly compatible with all dependencies I loaded from remote repos.
Of course it doesn't always work seamlessly, and heavily depends on how the library authors distribute their code, but for me works most of the time, even when it requires some tweaks in the configuration (e.g. libFour is the headers-only library, and doesn't require any linking at all, while libThree has inconsistent target name libThreeProj)

As suggested by @mozway, you can use a function or the walrus operator in lambda function:
# The fastest
def minmax_scale(x):
    xmin = x.min(axis=0)
    xmax = x.max(axis=0)
    return (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin)

# Average performance, using walrus operator (Python &gt;= 3.8)
minmax_scale = lambda x: (x - (m := x.min(axis=0))) / (x.max(axis=0) - m)

# The slowest
minmax_scale = lambda x: (x - x.min(axis=0)) / (x.max(axis=0) - x.min(axis=0))

            {
                request .Locations.Add(new Locations

}

Which you'd populate with strings:
var request = new Request();

{
    request.Locations.Add($&quot;{address.Latitude},{address.Longitude}&quot;);
}


As an aside...
Naming is important.  You currently have (but may no longer need) a class called Locations which represents a single location.  Mixing up plurality is a bug waiting to happen.

75083235,AWS Policy deny access on all production resources,"In our team, we have both our production and development stack in the same AWS account. These stacks are distinguished by their resource name. For example, we have a S3 bucket example-dev-bucket and example-prod-bucket . Al these resources are thus also distinguishable by their arn, e.g. arn:aws:s3:::example-dev-bucket and arn:aws:s3:::example-prod-bucket . Now I want to create an IAM role that grants access to all resources except for production resources.
To grant access to all resources is easy, I add a policy with the following statement
Effect: Allow
Action:
  - '*'
Resource:
  - '*'

After allowing all resources, I want to add a policy to deny the production resources. Only doing this for S3 resources works fine, like below.
Effect: Deny
Action:
  - '*'
Resource:
  - 'arn:aws:s3:::*-prod-*'

However, doing this for multiple services all at once, does not seem to be valid syntax. I have tried something like *-prod-* and arn:aws:*:*:*:*:*-prod-*.
A possible solution for me is to add each service just like I added the S3 service. However, it's easy to forget services. Rather I would just have a single line that includes all resources that have -prod- in their arn.
","amazon-web-services, aws-cloudformation, aws-policies, aws-roles",0,75084075,"You can make use of wildcards in resource names to accomplish this.
For example, if you include the env terms like &quot;Prod&quot; and &quot;Dev&quot; in all your resources, you can create policies including those terms.
This could be a policy for a Dev role for DynamoDB:
{
  &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
  &quot;Statement&quot;: {
    [
       &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,

    ]
  }
}

You can do the same for S3 and any other service.

However, it's easy to forget services.

Without using tags, there isn't an easy way to cover all services with one policy. The wildcard can't be used in the place of the resource itself (ex :arn:aws:*)

75763820,Chrome extension popup: fetch call in incognito mode,"(1) I'm creating an extension that works with a website that requires a user log in.
(2) I'm trying to detect if the user is logged in or not, from the extension's popup.
I can tell if the user is logged in or not by making a fetch call to specific URL, let's say http://www.example.com/account, and what happens is:

If the account is logged IN, the fetch call is redirected to http://www.example.com/account/data.

If the account is logged OUT, the fetch call is redirected to http://www.example.com/login.


The problem is:
I do the fetch call from the extension's content script and it works just fine, but, when I do it from inside the extension's popup, there comes two scenarios:
(1) If I'm logging into the website in a normal window, the fetch call works just fine, it detects that I'm logging in and redirects me to http://www.example.com/account/data.
(2) But, if I'm NOT logging into the website in a normal window and instead logging into it in an incognito window, it does NOT detect my login and it always redirects the fetch call to the http://www.example.com/login page!

I was thinking maybe it has something to do with the website's cookies, so, I tried to get the cookies, using the chrome.cookies API, and set them to the extension's popup, but, this didn't work!
Here is how I was trying to do it:
popup.js
chrome.cookies.getAll({
    domain: 'example.com'
}, function (cookies) {

    cookies.forEach(function (cookie, i) {
        // tried to set it this way, it didn't work: 
        chrome.cookies.set(cookie, function (savedCookie) {});

        // tried to set it to the `document.cookie`, as suggested here: 
        // https://stackoverflow.com/a/59620840/7607751
        // but, this didn't work either: 
        document.cookie = `${cookie.name}=${cookie.value}; `;
    });

    onAfterCookiesHandle();
});


function onAfterCookiesHandle() {
    console.log('document.cookie:', document.cookie);

    fetch(`https://www.example.com/account/`, {
        method: 'GET',
        credentials: 'include',

    }).then(function (response) {
        console.log('response:', response);
        if (response.url === `https://www.example.com/account/data`) {
            console.log('You are logged in, yay!');
        } else {
            console.log('You are logged out, oh no!');
        }

    }).catch(function (error) {
        console.error(&quot;HTTP fetch error:&quot;, error);
    });
}


PS. I'm enabling the extension to work with the incognito mode (from the extension's settings), and in my manifest.json file I have the key: &quot;incognito&quot;: &quot;spanning&quot;.
What am I doing wrong here? and how can I get this to work in the incognito mode ?
","javascript, google-chrome-extension, fetch-api",0,75764402,"I fixed it by changing the manifest's incognito key to be split.
This made me drop the idea of changing the cookies for the popup at all, because the popup in this split mode will be running in the same browser process along with its incognito window, while in the spanning mode the regular and the incognito windows were sharing the same memory cookie store!
I guess this was the reason for mixing the cookies lookup and the popup were searching for the website's cookies in the regular window's world instead of the incognito window world.
As per the Chrome extensions's documentation:

Spanning mode
The default mode is spanning, which means that the extension will
run in a single shared process. Any events or messages from an
incognito tab will be sent to the shared process, with an incognito
flag indicating where it came from. Because incognito tabs cannot use
this shared process, an extension using the spanning incognito mode
will not be able to load pages from its extension package into the
main frame of an incognito tab.
Split mode
The split mode means that all pages in an incognito window will run
in their own incognito process. If the extension contains a background
page, that will also run in the incognito process. This incognito
process runs along side the regular process, but has a separate
memory-only cookie store. Each process sees events and messages only
from its own context (for example, the incognito process will see only
incognito tab updates). The processes are unable to communicate with
each other.

","algorithm, kotlin",0,75210889,"I'm assuming Exercise is an immutable class.
You can search for the index of the item to replace with indexOfFirst. If the index returned is negative, it means nothing fit the predicate. I suppose in that case you might just want to add the new item instead of swapping it in. Or maybe you would want to throw an error.
val exercisesList = mutableListOf(

74871587,Improve itertools.pairwise() function,"I am trying to create a custom function that improves the itertools pairwise function.
Unlike the pairwise function, which returns pairs of items (n=2), I would like to be able to specify the grouping length (n=x). So that I can return groups of items of a specified length. Is this possible?
So when n=2, the groupwise function should be equivalent to the itertools pairwise function. But when n=3, I would expect it to return groups of 3.
This is what I have so far - which is essentially the same as the pairwise function. ie. works for n=2.
Code:
from itertools import tee

my_string = 'abcdef'

def groupwise(iterable, n):
    a = tee(iterable, n)
    next(a[n-1], None)
    return zip(a[0], a[1])

for item in groupwise(my_string, 2):
    print(&quot;&quot;.join(item))

Output:
ab
bc
cd
de
ef

I am trying to modify the code above to accept n=3, n=4, n=5, ... n=x, but I cannot think of a way to provide the undetermined number of components to the zip function considering that I would like to specify any value of n &lt;= len(my_string)


When n=3 the output should be:
abc
bcd
cde
def

","python, algorithm, python-itertools",-2,74871647,"tee isn't going to scale in this way, unfortunately. Writing pairwise takes one tee call, and if you want to do it for N elements in each group, you'll need N-1 tee calls.
Fortunately, we can do better by just rolling the loop ourselves. What we're going to do is keep track of the last N elements that we've seen ourselves and yield them whenever we have a group that's big enough. To do that, we need a data structure that can efficiently add things to the right and subtract them from the left. collections.deque will do nicely. In fact, it even has a maxlen parameter that will automatically subtract from the left exactly when we need it to.

from collections import deque

def groupwise(iterable, n):
    accum = deque((), n)
    for element in iterable:
        accum.append(element)
        if len(accum) == n:
            yield tuple(accum)

Construct an empty deque (the first constructor argument is the initial elements: an empty tuple) whose capacity is n. When we have more than n elements added to the right side, it will automatically drop the leftmost one. We could do this by hand, but deque will do it for us so we might as well utilize the functionality they gave us.
Then iterate over the iterable. Append each element to the end of the deque (dropping from the left as needed to satisfy the maximum length requirement). Then, if the deque has n elements, we yield it. That makes our function a generator function, so it will produce a new iterator consisting of all of the yielded values.
We make a shallow copy of our deque so we're not just yielding the same (mutable) deque object each time. We also make that shallow copy a tuple, rather than a deque, to be more in line with other itertools functionality.
To call, use
print(list(groupwise(range(10), 3)))
# Output: [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7), (6, 7, 8), (7, 8, 9)]

const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(CLIENT_DISPLAY_GROUP, {
    variables: { id: 'display-group-1' }

The useQuery data is null so it doesn’t find any data in the cache. But ClientDisplayGroup:display-group-1 exists, and as I mentioned. The ClientTemplate returns the data!

74670948,How to perform calculations on a subset of a column in a pandas dataframe?,"With a dataset such as this:
    famid  birth  age   ht
0       1      1  one  2.8
1       1      1  two  3.4
2       1      2  one  2.9
3       1      2  two  3.8
4       1      3  one  2.2
5       1      3  two  2.9

...where we've got values for a variable ht for different categories of, for example,  age  , I would like to adjust a subset of the data in df['ht'] where df['age'] == 'one' only. And I would like to do it without creating a new column.
I've tried:
df[df['age']=='one']['ht'] = df[df['age']=='one']['ht']*10**6

But to my mild surprise the numbers don't change. Maybe because the A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame warning is triggered in the same run. I've also tried with df.mask() and df.where(). But to no avail. I'm clearly failing at something very basic here, but I'd really like to know how to do this properly. There are similarly sounding questions such as Performing calculations on subset of data frame subset in Python, but the suggested solutions here are pointing towards df.groupby(), and I don't think this necessarily is the right approach here.
Thank you for any suggestions!
Here's a fully reproducible dataset:

74778945,Convert latitude and longitude values to radians,"I've two columns (Oracle) namely latitude and longitude in format I've mentioned below.

Note:
The latitude of a location is represented by three two-digit numbers separated by periods in the order of degrees,minutes from degrees,seconds from degrees that are followed by a N for north or a S for south.
The longitude of a location is represented by a three digit number and two two-digit numbers separated by periods in the order of degrees,minutes from degrees,seconds from degrees that are followed by a W for west or an E for east

74807729,isalpha giving True for some Sinhala words,"I'm trying to check if a sentence only has Sinhala words (they can be nonsense words as long as they are written in Sinhala). Sometimes there can be English words in a sentence mixed with sinhala words. The thing is sometimes Sinhala words give True when checked with isalpha() giving incorrect results in my classification.
for example I did something like this.
for i in ['මට', 'කෑම', 'කන්න', 'ඕන']:
  print(i.isalpha())

gives
True
False
False
True

Is there a way to overcome this
","python, unicode, utf-8, isalpha",1,74808074,"How isalpha works is by checking if the category of a character for Unicode is Lm, Lt, Lu, Ll, or Lo. See below for their meaning.
Ll    Lowercase Letter
Lm    Modifier Letter
Lo    Other Letter
Lu    Uppercase Letter

This &quot;breaks&quot; python when characters are joined together.
In your first example if we see ම or ට the category (from the lookup tool below) is Lo. This is valid so it gives us True
In your second example, the first letter is කෑ which is actually two characters (ක and ෑ). The category for ෑ is not a letter one so it returns False.
Long story short, Python is technically right. If you we were to do what you intended you would have to split joined characters and then remove the extra characters added on.
So, it is complicated. There may be a library out there that does this but I do not know any.

","ios, swift, sqlite",1,75033516,"You should not include the id attribute in your SQL insert statement since it will be automatically handled by the db engine. So change your insert statement to
let insertStatementString = &quot;INSERT INTO person (firstName, lastName, phone, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);&quot;

When I did this I could run your database related code in a playground and reading values successfully without any runtime error. If you are still getting Unexpectedly found nil while implicitly unwrapping an Optional value error then there is something else that is incorrect, perhaps related to your view controller.

75762757,Storing JWT access token in memory?,"I have read that the most secure way to store the tokens is actually using a cookie for the refresh token and in-memory (like in a variable) for the access token.
While I understand this is secure, I do not really understand how it would work in practice. Would it mean that we have to create a new access token with our refresh token on each request? Or is there a way we can make it valid and copied to new variables until it is expired?
And storing an access token in memory, wouldn't that be an issue? The access token will get cleared on each refresh of the page, so each time I login, I will need to call the login endpoint again
I have tried a few things like storing the access token in localStorage, but that seems a big no no
","reactjs, next.js, jwt, access-token",0,75762873,"
While I understand this is secure, I do not really understand how it would work in practice. Would it mean that we have to create a new access token with our refresh token on each request?

Not on each request, but on each full page reload. You would store it in something like react context, which is in memory and would make it available to your whole application. You can then have a core fetch implementation that reads this from context and puts it in the headers or whatever.
Additionally, in that core fetch implementation, you would check for requests that error because the access token expired, and then get another access token if that happens, set it back in context, and replay whatever the request was.

And storing an access token in memory, wouldn't that be an issue? The access token will get cleared on each refresh of the page, so each time I login, I will need to call the login endpoint again

This is correct, but it's by design. There are tradeoffs here about how much that affects first-load time (but I wouldn't expect it to be terrible). You'd call it somewhere high up in your component tree so it happens early on. This is quite normal and I've seen it a lot.
If you really care about that, I've seen some solutions whereby you put the access token in another HTTP-only cookie (create it serverside) for the full page load and that means it's sent for future requests. From there on in if it needs a new one it makes an API call which also uses set-cookie to write a fresh one to the client. Since it's there on the actual response to get the page itself, you avoid any waterfall of clientside requests.
Some people just store it in local storage but then as you imply, there are also security tradeoffs there and so it's best avoided.

Name

I know we can use the trim and len functions to remove the last characters from column Name (remove 'smith') to show output as only 'Paul`.
How can we do the same for time in column Intime?
I tried
SELECT SUBSTRING('15:10:45.0486392',1,len('15:10:45.0486392')-8) AS Intime 
FROM stuattrecordAM

The output I got is &quot;15:10:45&quot; as expected.
SELECT SUBSTRING('Intime',1,len('Intime')-8) AS Intime 
FROM stuattrecordAM

When I try to use Intime column name instead the string it's showing the following error:

nodes: I assumed it is executed on whichever node the pod is assigned to, however pulling starts even if I have no docker installed on my nodes.
head: the docker configuration on the head node doesn't effect pulling: I added some certificates for a private registry, which aren't active when starting the pod, only when I directly interact with docker on the node.

So I'm confused: where is docker pull executed when starting a pod and how can I modify it's configuration? (namely adding certificates)
","docker, kubernetes",0,75815463,"When a pod is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, the container image specified in the pod specification is pulled by the kubelet running on the node where the pod is scheduled to run.
The kubelet is responsible for managing the containers on a node, and it pulls container images from the specified container image repository (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, etc.). The kubelet uses the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O, etc.) to pull the image.
If you don't have Docker installed on your nodes, it's likely that you're using a different container runtime such as containerd or CRI-O. The kubelet uses the configured container runtime to pull the container image.
To modify the Docker configuration used by the kubelet, you can modify the Docker configuration file on each node where Docker is installed. This file is typically located at /etc/docker/daemon.json. You can add any required certificates to this file, and then restart the Docker daemon for the changes to take effect.
Note that if you're using a different container runtime, you'll need to modify the configuration file for that runtime instead. For example, if you're using containerd, you'll need to modify the /etc/containerd/config.toml file.

There is a puzzeling element.  when I am running the substitute function outside the function I am writing, everything runs smoothly.  However, when I am inserting the substitute in the function I am writing, nothing works.
# the list of dataframe I want to group together is extracted from the environment... 
# everything is ok for now. I get a nice list.

# now I want to (1) select various fields in the dataframe and (2)  
# assign the name of each elements to the records in order to perform  
# further groupings when the list will be combined in a single table.

I am puzzeled here however. When I am running the deparse / substitute function, everything works great outside the function.  WHen I run it inside the function, it is another story.  Instead of getting the name of the dataframe, I get the nameof the variable (x).  I tried various solutions on Stackoverflow, but none seemed to work so far.

","angular, lazy-loading, angular-module",1,76028795,"Okey, so I think you did miss understand the way css works in angular. and are applying a css in an improper maner.

A component, in Angular, should be able to leave on his own and should not impact other component (Not that way at least).
But if you wished to have a shared css file, you could do one of the following
1: Shared CSS

Create a new shared.component.css file
Add you css in there

:host {
  .test-b {
    background-color: pink;
  }
}


Use it in the component you wish.

2 : Global CSS

Add global css in the global_styles.css file. this will change the teat-b in your entire project

3 : Import exported css in the angular.json file

Open the angular.json file
Add a new style to the styles array

&quot;src/global_styles.css&quot;,
&quot;new/path/to/my/project&quot;

_here if you don't know how to export CSS _
Explanation: ViewEncapsulation
None
Css will, when rendered, get applied to the entire project. prefer adding the component selector to avoid it having an impact in your project

Pro: Let you change the css of some children element that you would be able to change otherwise.

Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: signal is aborted without reason

From what I understand my useEffect throw this when the component is unmounted an the query didn't finish to run.
Now, this cause my catch to always trigger at least once, cause it looks like when the effect is run again cause one of the dep changed, it fail.
I &quot;&quot;&quot; fixed &quot;&quot;&quot; it by doing
  const [state, setState] = useState(undefined);
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    (async () =&gt; {
      try {

And not assign any state in case the error is an abort. But I couldn't find any proper solution or I don't understand why this is problematic before and not now, I did update some package but none mention a change of behavior on this end.
My question is, what should I do to do thing correctly ?
","javascript, reactjs, react-hooks, graphql",0,75383592,"I don't think the error you've quoted is coming from React. React used to complain if you did a state update in a component that was no longer mounted, but the error message it used was &quot;Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.&quot; But recent versions of React don't do that because the React team decided it was too fussy.
Still, answering the question as asked:

If getFirstWorkspace offers a way to tell it to cancel what it's doing, you'd do that. For instance, if it supported AbortSignal, you might do this:
useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // *** Create a controller and get its signal
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const { signal } = controller;
    (async () =&gt; {
        try {
            // *** Pass the signal to `getFirstWorkspace`
            const workspace = await getFirstWorkspace(signal);
            // *** Only do something if the signal isn't aborted
            if (!signal.aborted) {
                // Do Something
                setState(withSomething);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            // *** Only do something if the signal isn't aborted
            if (!signal.aborted) {
                // Do Something Else
                setState(withErrorSomething);
            }
        }
    })();
    return () =&gt; {
        // *** Abort the signal on cleanup
        controller.abort();
    };
}, [generateLink, getFirstWorkspace, masterDataStoreId]);

...or similar if it doesn't support AbortSignal specifically but does provide some other way of cancelling its work.

If it doesn't, you could fall back to a flag telling you not to use the result:
useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // *** Start with a flag set to `false`
    let cancelled = false;
    (async () =&gt; {
        try {
            const workspace = await getFirstWorkspace();
            // *** Only do something if the flag is still `false`
            if (!cancelled) {
                // Do Something
                setState(withSomething);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            // *** Only do something if the flag is still `false`
            if (!cancelled) {
                // Do Something Else
                setState(withErrorSomething);
            }
        }
    })();
    return () =&gt; {
        // *** Set the flag on cleanup
        cancelled = true;
    };
}, [generateLink, getFirstWorkspace, masterDataStoreId]);



It's better to actually cancel the work if you can, but it's fine to have a fallback boolean if you can't. Just don't assume you can't, be sure to check first. :-)

Side note: I love async/await, but when you're doing just a single call and getting a promise, doing an async wrapper and try/catch around await can be a bit overkill. FWIW, just using the promise directly looks like this (using the flag in this case, but it works just as well with the controller/signal):
useEffect(() =&gt; {
    let cancelled = false;
    getFirstWorkspace().then(
        (workspace) =&gt; {
            if (!cancelled) {
                // Do Something
                setState(withSomething);
            }
        },
        (error) =&gt; {
            if (!cancelled) {
                // Do Something Else
                setState(withErrorSomething);
            }
        }

with a(id, MON, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN) as (values (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0),(2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0))

I got this result but I changed CTE.
My request:
with a(id, days) as (values (1,0),(1,0),(1,1),(1,1),(1,1),(1,0),(1,0),(2,1),(2,1),(2,1),(2,1),(2,0),(2,0),(2,0))

","sql, db2",-1,74776978,"If I understand your question, you want to be able to generate the output from your second query without altering the initial CTE a (which presumably represents an actual table or something).
There will be multiple ways of doing this, but one possibility is something like:
with a(shop_id, MON, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN) as (values (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0),(2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0))
, b as (SELECT shop_id, MON + TUE + WED + THUR + FRI + SAT + SUN cnt FROM a)
SELECT shop_id, 'Working', cnt
FROM b
GROUP BY shop_id, cnt
UNION ALL
SELECT shop_id, 'Non-working', 7-cnt
FROM b
GROUP BY shop_id, cnt

Here, the CTE b contains the sum of working days for each shop_id. This is then unioned together with the non-working days (7-working). Using the second CTE isn't necessary, but lets us avoid repeating the bit that adds all the days together. If you prefer, you could do:
with a(shop_id, MON, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN) as (values (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0),(2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0))
SELECT shop_id, 'Working', MON + TUE + WED + THUR + FRI + SAT + SUN cnt
FROM a
UNION ALL
SELECT shop_id, 'Non-working', 7-(MON + TUE + WED + THUR + FRI + SAT + SUN)
FROM a

Another options is to actually unpivot the table (convert the columns into rows) and then group by the shop_id and day_type. Something like:
with a(shop_id, MON, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN) as (values (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0),(2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0))
,
b AS (SELECT shop_id, CASE P.w WHEN 0 THEN 'Non-working' ELSE 'Working' END day_type
FROM a, TABLE (VALUES(a.MON),
                  (a.TUE),
                  (a.WED),
                  (a.THUR),
                  (a.FRI),
                  (a.SAT),
                  (a.SUN)) AS P(w))
SELECT shop_id, day_type, count(*) cnt
FROM b
GROUP BY shop_id, day_type

In all cases above, you can use an ORDER BY to get the rows in the order you want them.
Here is a Fiddle of these working.

TL;DR: call clojure (which does not use rlwrap¹; use

that to call clojure with some settings, that are suitable for a Lisp.
rlwrap is a great tool, to get readline capabilities with
interactive CLI tools, that don't have it (e.g. emacs/vi-mode, history,
&quot;hippy&quot; completion).  But in this case it is the culprit to smash up the
REPL.  What's underlying problem is not clear, but in cases like this
the options usually are: buggy software (the terminal, rlwrap, or the
way Clojure interacts with the terminal), wrong/buggy TERM settings or
term-capabilities.
That said, rlwrap might be the &quot;just good enough&quot; option here
anyway.  First of all Clojure developers tend to use the REPL via the
editor anyway.  Second there is a far superior option to get what
rlwrap brings to the table:
Rebel-Readline
Beside emacs/vi-modes and history it brings (and probably more):

syntax highlighting for both input and output (with pretty-printing)
multi-line edit in the REPL
proper auto-completion

);

    UNIQUE (asset_id, category_id)
);


INSERT INTO asset (id, &quot;name&quot;) VALUES(1, 'Awesome Asset with a hit');
INSERT INTO asset (id, &quot;name&quot;) VALUES(2, 'Great Asset without a hit');

INSERT INTO category (id, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;ctype&quot;) VALUES(1, 'First Category', NULL);
INSERT INTO category (id, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;ctype&quot;) VALUES(2, 'Second Category', 'directory');

INSERT INTO asset_category (&quot;asset_id&quot;, &quot;category_id&quot;) VALUES(1, 2);
INSERT INTO asset_category (&quot;asset_id&quot;, &quot;category_id&quot;) VALUES(2, 1);

Task
I want to get all assets with their category Id (in case they have one of type &quot;directory&quot;. Otherwise NULL as category.
See my query below, I wrote two joins letting me limit the results in the ON clause. However, since both are related to the other category, the first JOIN hinders me to get a clean result.
What I tried
This query Query A
SELECT a.id &quot;assetId&quot;, c.id &quot;categoryId&quot;
FROM asset a
LEFT JOIN asset_category ac ON ac.asset_id = a.id
left join category c on (
    c.id = ac.category_id
    AND
    c.ctype = 'directory'   
)

restulting in:
assetId     categoryId
1           (null)
1           2
2           (null)

That is almost good, except, assetId 1 appears twice. This probably due to first JOIN, which creates a relation to assetcategory and the other category not of type 'directory'. Same as assetId 2.
Query B uses inner join:
SELECT a.id &quot;assetId&quot;, c.id &quot;categoryId&quot;
FROM asset a
LEFT JOIN asset_category ac ON ac.asset_id = a.id
inner join category c on (
    c.id = ac.category_id
    AND
    c.ctype = 'directory'   
)

resulting in
assetId     categoryId
1           2

However, here the problem is, it hides asset with id 2 for me as join is not successfully resolving asset id 2.
Desired output
assetId | categoryId
1       | 2
2       | null

I would be really happy about this seemingly simple task.
",postgresql,1,75187823,"demo:db&lt;&gt;fiddle
Your first query is a good approach. It seems you wanted only one record per id. This is what is DISTINCT ON for:
SELECT DISTINCT ON (a.id)
    a.id, c.id
FROM asset a
LEFT JOIN asset_category ac ON a.id = ac.asset_id
LEFT JOIN category c ON c.id = ac.category_id AND c.&quot;ctype&quot; = 'directory'
ORDER BY a.id, ctype NULLS LAST

So, just order your joined result by id first, and order ctype = NULL records to bottom, which makes the directory values bubble up being the first one. DISTINCT ON takes the first record for each id afterwards which is the one you expect.

75610549,Can Someone Explain Why With PHP You Cannot Have A Form Inside Another Forms Processing Logic?,"I noticed when building a custom plugin for WordPress - I could not have a form nested within another form.
For example,
?&gt;

    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Username&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    var_dump(&quot;Submit Successful&quot;);}

So this works - when the form &quot;get_new_user&quot; is submitted the message &quot;Submit Successful&quot; outputs.
But when I nest a form inside a form - it does not work.
For example:
    ?&gt;
    &lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Username&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;?php

    if (isset($_POST['submit_sensitive_data'])) {
        var_dump(&quot;Second Submit Successful&quot;);}}

This nested form submit - does not work - the second var_dump message &quot;Second Submit Successful&quot; is never triggered and I receive an error message in the debug.log of:
rtrim(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($string) of type string is deprecated..

Now when I move the second form outside the if statement like this:
    ?&gt;
    &lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Username&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;?php

    if (isset($_POST['submit_sensitive_data'])) {
        var_dump(&quot;Second Submit Successful&quot;);}

r1  v1  [{&quot;x_title&quot;: &quot;xt1&quot;, &quot;x_label&quot;: &quot;xl1&quot;, &quot;y_title...  v3        x
r2  v1  [{&quot;x_title&quot;: &quot;xt1&quot;, &quot;x_label&quot;: &quot;xl1&quot;, &quot;y_title...  v3        y

The main point of conversation will be c2, which is a list of dictionaries. I would like to &quot;pull out&quot; each unique value for the k,v pair where k ~= f&quot;{parent.group_by}_title&quot;. So if group_by on the row == x, each unique x_title will have a &quot;child&quot; row generated that keeps all the remaining values.
The end dataframe will hopefully look similar to:
pd.DataFrame(
            index=[&quot;r1&quot;,&quot;r2&quot;,&quot;r1&quot;,&quot;r1&quot;,&quot;r2&quot;,&quot;r2&quot;,&quot;r2&quot;],
            columns=[&quot;group&quot;,&quot;orig_name&quot;,&quot;c2&quot;,&quot;c3&quot;, &quot;type&quot;],
            data=[

                [&quot;xt2&quot;,&quot;v1&quot;,[{&quot;y_title&quot;:&quot;yt3&quot;,&quot;y_label&quot;:&quot;yl3&quot;}],&quot;v3&quot;,&quot;child&quot;],

I'm able to do this &quot;manually&quot; but iterating through each row and going from there. But I would like to have a more &quot;pandas&quot; answer if possible. I've dabbled in ~apply(lambda ~, explode, using a def children(row) function put into a ~apply(lambda ~, and a few other methods. They are didn't quite align to what I'm interested in, and none are quite close enough to provide details.
I'm sure (as I always do) I'm somehow overthinking/looking a simple solution, just not aware of a function that will help, or just no using one of my tries correctly.
Hoping someone could explain a better way of doing this? Thank you!
","python, pandas, dataframe, lambda, explode",0,75624901,"There may be a more direct way of approaching this but to me  it looks like you could:

turn the nested list/dicts from c2 into rows/columns
perform parent/child grouping
rebuild the c2 column

Step 1:
You can .explode(&quot;c2&quot;) then pd.json_normalize
df = df.explode(&quot;c2&quot;)
c2 = pd.json_normalize(df[&quot;c2&quot;]).set_index(df.index)
df[c2.columns] = c2
df[&quot;c2&quot;] = None

I've assigned c2 to None here just to simplify the output.
    c1    c2  c3 group_by x_title x_label y_title y_label
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt2     yl2
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt2     xl2     yt3     yl3
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt2     xl2     yt2     yl2
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt3     xl3     yt3     yl3

Step 2:
.columns.get_indexer can map column names to indexes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; df[&quot;group_by&quot;] + &quot;_title&quot;
r1    x_title
r1    x_title
r1    x_title
r2    y_title
r2    y_title
r2    y_title
Name: group_by, dtype: object

&gt;&gt;&gt; df.columns.get_indexer(df[&quot;group_by&quot;] + &quot;_title&quot;)
array([4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6])

The indexes allow you to extract from a different column on a per-row basis: How can I select a specific column from each row in a Pandas DataFrame?
This can be used to create group/key/value columns:
df[&quot;key_name&quot;]   = df[&quot;group_by&quot;].map({&quot;x&quot;: &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot;: &quot;x&quot;}) + &quot;_title&quot;
df[&quot;value_name&quot;] = df[&quot;group_by&quot;].map({&quot;x&quot;: &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot;: &quot;x&quot;}) + &quot;_label&quot;

rows = range(len(df.index))

df[&quot;group&quot;] = df.values[rows, df.columns.get_indexer(df[&quot;group_by&quot;] + &quot;_title&quot;)]
df[&quot;key&quot;]   = df.values[rows, df.columns.get_indexer(df[&quot;key_name&quot;])]
df[&quot;value&quot;] = df.values[rows, df.columns.get_indexer(df[&quot;value_name&quot;])]

    c1    c2  c3 group_by x_title x_label y_title y_label key_name value_name group  key value
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1  y_title    y_label   xt1  yt1   yl1
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt2     yl2  y_title    y_label   xt1  yt2   yl2
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt2     xl2     yt3     yl3  y_title    y_label   xt2  yt3   yl3
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1  x_title    x_label   yt1  xt1   xl1
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt2     xl2     yt2     yl2  x_title    x_label   yt2  xt2   xl2
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt3     xl3     yt3     yl3  x_title    x_label   yt3  xt3   xl3

Step 3:
The parent rows:
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.groupby(df.index).first()
    c1    c2  c3 group_by x_title x_label y_title y_label key_name value_name group  key value
r1  v1  None  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1  y_title    y_label   xt1  yt1   yl1
r2  v1  None  v3        y     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1  x_title    x_label   yt1  xt1   xl1

The child rows:
I think there may be a smarter way to turn the columns back into dicts - but for now:
df[&quot;c2&quot;] = [ 
   { row[f&quot;{col}_name&quot;]: row[col] for col in (&quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;) }   
   for row in df[[&quot;key_name&quot;, &quot;value_name&quot;, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;]].reset_index(drop=True).to_dict(&quot;records&quot;)
]

&gt;&gt;&gt; df[&quot;c2&quot;]
r1    {'y_title': 'yt1', 'y_label': 'yl1'}
r1    {'y_title': 'yt2', 'y_label': 'yl2'}
r1    {'y_title': 'yt3', 'y_label': 'yl3'}
r2    {'x_title': 'xt1', 'x_label': 'xl1'}
r2    {'x_title': 'xt2', 'x_label': 'xl2'}
r2    {'x_title': 'xt3', 'x_label': 'xl3'}

You can then .groupby(&quot;group&quot;) and .agg()
For .agg() you want to use list for the c2 column and first for every other column.
One way to write this is to map all column names to the default action you want and merge a dict of &quot;overrides&quot;:
&gt;&gt;&gt; columns = &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict.fromkeys(columns, &quot;first&quot;) 
{'a': 'first', 'b': 'first', 'c': 'first'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict.fromkeys(columns, &quot;first&quot;) | dict(c=&quot;list&quot;)
{'a': 'first', 'b': 'first', 'c': 'list'}

On the dataframe:
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.reset_index().groupby(&quot;group&quot;).agg(dict.fromkeys(df.columns, &quot;first&quot;) | dict(c2=list))
       c1                                                 c2  c3 group_by x_title x_label y_title y_label group key_name value_name  key value
group                                                                                                                                         
xt1    v1  [{'y_title': 'yt1', 'y_label': 'yl1'}, {'y_tit...  v3        x     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1   xt1  y_title    y_label  yt1   yl1
xt2    v1             [{'y_title': 'yt3', 'y_label': 'yl3'}]  v3        x     xt2     xl2     yt3     yl3   xt2  y_title    y_label  yt3   yl3
yt1    v1             [{'x_title': 'xt1', 'x_label': 'xl1'}]  v3        y     xt1     xl1     yt1     yl1   yt1  x_title    x_label  xt1   xl1
yt2    v1             [{'x_title': 'xt2', 'x_label': 'xl2'}]  v3        y     xt2     xl2     yt2     yl2   yt2  x_title    x_label  xt2   xl2
yt3    v1             [{'x_title': 'xt3', 'x_label': 'xl3'}]  v3        y     xt3     xl3     yt3     yl3   yt3  x_title    x_label  xt3   xl3

You could then remove any columns that are no longer needed - add a parent/child identifer column to the parent/child rows and .concat them.

75392538,does using Sequalize.Op.eq prevent sql injections or should input also be normalized?,"I'm using nodejs, express and sequlize to display a form and save it to a databse. As I'm new to backend I would like to make sure the data saved to a db is safe.
As stated in the title, is it enought to use Seqlelize.Op.eq to prevent SQL injection or should some other technique (such as normalize) also be used?
What the app does is process the user input for &quot;typos&quot; and underlines incorrect usage and gives explanations as to why it's wrong.
So, the data which will be saved to the db will vary.
This is the current code I'm using
async function addStringToTable(string, uuid) {
    // Save the input string to the database
    try{
        await UserText.create({

This automatically prevents sql injection. Its equivalent to prepared queries, which you would use in case of writing raw sql queries. But for sequalize(and any other ORM I know) it is done automatically with every query, no special syntax needed. You can also confirm that by logging query which this sequalize code outputs

","typescript, visual-studio-code",1,75377341,"Your screenshot is of hover info for a TypeScript type declaration for String.prototype.split(), which shows its documentation comment from a lib.d.ts file bundled with TypeScript. You can find the source code for the lib.d.ts files on TypeScript's GitHub repo: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/lib.
You'll see there that they do provide translations for TypeScript's compiler's error messages, but I'm not aware of them providing versions of their lib.d.ts files with translated documentation comments.
Much more common on the internet and open source world for web libraries is for English to be used as a lingua franca, which might explain why in my (perhaps limited) experience in web dev, I haven't seen anyone put effort into providing versions of their package files with documentation comments translated to various languages.
So unfortunately, it's not something that changing your display language setting can affect.
This probably extends to more than just web libraries. English is fairly well established as the lingua franca of code at least in the open source world. Most of this hover documentation even for other programming lanugages is pulled from documentation comments, which are usually in English, and as already stated, most libraries don't provide header files / documentation sources with translated documentation comments. At least- not that I've observed in my limited experience in the programming world. I'd be happy to be pointed to counterexamples, though!

I need in the plot, and more specifically in the x-axis instead of timestampts' values to have something like this: &quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day2&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;,... Any ideas?

val items = mapOf(&quot;a&quot; to 1, &quot;b&quot; to 2)
and retrieve a value like this:
val item = items[&quot;a&quot;]
The bracket will call the get function. Looking at Kotlin's the source code for Maps, all that I see for the get function is this:
public operator fun get(key: K): V?

I couldn't find any implementation of get, so it's not clear how Kotlin internally finds a map item.

","java, user-interface, animation, javafx",0,75982520,"While you can consider all the other suggestions in the comments, below is my version of addressing this issue.
Personally I would prefer to create a custom control that can handle this automatically irrespective of its Parent. Currently your logic seems to assume that the TextField is always in a GridPane.
I am considering the usage of Timeline rather than TranslateTransition, because of the fact that I only need the 'end value' for using Timeline. But with TranslateTransition, you need to provide the 'by' value or the 'from/to' values to run the transition (which is the reason it is getting messed up in your case).
Below is the demo of the custom TextField that demonstrates the behavior when rendered in different Parent nodes (here VBox &amp; GridPane)

75585439,How to manually increase Brightness in Pillow np.ndarray,"Im trying to make an Image Editor in Python using tkinter. I've developped functions to manipulate images, increasing brightness, contrast and so on. I've been getting really wierd results when converting the array back to a Pillow Image using Image.fromarray()
I know there are built in methods to increase brightness, but i'd like to expand this to more complex things. So converting Image to array and the other way arround is so important.
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

class Imagem:
    def __init__(self, path_imagem):
        self.image = Image.open(path_imagem)

    def brightness(self, factor):
        array_imagem = np.array(self.imagem)
        array_imagem = array_imagem + factor
        self.image = Image.fromarray(array_imagem, mode='RGB')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    img = Imagem('./assets/panda.png')
    img.brightness(30)
    img.image.show()

This is the original Image and the image I'm getting back
original
modified
(These are prints from the images, I couldn't upload the original images due to size constraints)
shouldn't I be adding 30 (in this case) to all rgb pixel values?
Answer:
from PIL import Image

class Imagem:
    def __init__(self, path_imagem):
        self.image = Image.open(path_imagem)

    def brightness(self, factor):

        array_imagem = array_imagem.astype(np.uint16)
        array_imagem = array_imagem + factor
        array_imagem = np.clip(array_imagem, a_min=0, a_max=255)
        self.image = Image.fromarray(array_imagem.astype(np.uint8), mode='RGB')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    img = Imagem('./assets/panda.png')

Thank you for the help :)
","python, python-3.x, numpy, python-imaging-library",1,75585629,"By adding 30, you have overflowed the 0..255 range that can be stored in a uint8. You can see that the brightest areas have burnt out.
You need to promote your data to a larger type, e.g. uint16, and then call np.clip() to clamp the values into the range 0..255 and convert back to uint8 to prevent it.
Also, adding 30 to all RGB channels is not ideal. You will normally get a better result by changing to Lab mode or HSL and just increasing the L channel, else you'll tend to get colour distortions.

to something more linear like like we do with combineLatestFrom in ngrx.

and
withLatestFrom(
  from(TodosDB.getAll()).pipe(

Any ideas how to deal with this scenario without nesting pipe map in a switchMap?
PS: this might be obvious to you but I don't know much and I looked up on the internet and found withLatestFrom but not sure what I am missing.
EDIT: this is the best I got so far:
switchMap(([action, state]) =&gt;
  forkJoin([of(action), of(state), TodosDB.getAll()])
),
map(
  ([action, state, todos]) =&gt; onQueryTodoDone({ items: todos }),
  catchError((err) =&gt; of(onQueryTodoFail({ error: err })))

The above is better but I have no idea if that can cause issues later. But hopefully I was able to communicate the idea. Which is append a promise result to the piped observable keep it's original structure
[Observable&lt;Actions&gt;,Observable&lt;State&gt;,Observable&lt;FromPromise&gt;]

","javascript, rxjs",1,74670735,"Joining a few dots here and taking a bit of a guess I would say the problem stems from TodosDB.getAll returning a Promise.
With a promise based function you want to lazily evaluate it, as such a function is executed immediately when it is called, unlike an observable based function which requires a subscription.
This is why the switchMap based solutions work, because the body of the switchMap is not evaluated until the source emits.
In your shortened version using withLatestFrom, there is no lazy evaluation, the getAll call is probably evaluated once and once only when the effect is set up.
You can use the defer operator to convert your promise based function to one that behaves more appropriately with the rxjs observable based operators.
withLatestFrom(defer(() =&gt; this.getAll())),  // use of defer
map(([[action, state], todos]) =&gt; [action, state, todos]),  // refine the shape of the data to your requirements
...

",haskell,1,76028408,"The use of pure is only used in the context of the (-&gt;) a instance of Applicative. Indeed [src]:

instance Applicative ((-&gt;) r) where
    pure = const
    (&lt;*&gt;) f g x = f x (g x)
    liftA2 q f g x = q (f x) (g x)

This thus means that pure id is equivalent here to const id. It might have been better to use const id instead.
The reason it will choose (-&gt;) r, only for the scope of pure id, that is an important aspect, is because fmap (or &lt;$&gt;) thus need a function at the left side. The only way to achieve that is to let pure id work with the instance Applicative (-&gt;) r.
But it is important to stress that the instance it picks for the applicative of pure has nothing to do with the Applicative k that will pick for &lt;$&gt; and &lt;*&gt;.
We use const id, to use return id, regardless of the item in the list, we return id. It would thus probably have been more clear with:
(*&gt;) :: Applicative k =&gt; k a -&gt; k b -&gt; k b
(*&gt;) ka kb = const id &lt;$&gt; ka &lt;*&gt; kb
or simpler:

75130798,"Please comment on 3 flutter_bloc writing styles: BlocBuilder, BlocListener, BlocConsumer","I am practicing with flick_bloc and I wonder when to use BlocBuilder, when to use BlocListener and when to use BlocConsumer. I asked a few people, they said that BlocBuilder is used the most and I also started and just practiced with it, but it seems that Blocbuilder only changed for the first time, I don't know if it's true. Can you guys give me some comments on these spellings
","flutter, flutter-bloc",-1,75131165,"Bloc Builder

Used for building widgets, For Example: If you want to show a list of employee names on a page, you can return a ListView widget based on the bloc state. Also, if the employee list comes from an API, then you will need different states such as Loading, Success and Failure states. Based on these different states you can return different widgets from BlocBuilder. A CircularProgressIndicator for showing loading state, ListView for showing employee list in the success state and Error text widget for showing error message if the API fails.

BlocBuilder&lt;BlocA, BlocAState&gt;(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is Loading) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    }
  }
)

Bloc Listener

BlocBuilder can only return widgets. If you want to show a snackbar or want to Navigate from one page to another, then you need to use BlocListener for that.

BlocListener&lt;BlocA, BlocAState&gt;(
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is Success) {
      Navigator.push(context,
       MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) =&gt; const SecondRoute()),
     );
    }
  }
)

Bloc Consumer

If you have the use of both BlocListener and BlocBuilder, then it is better to use BlocConsumer. It reduces the boilerplate of using BlocListener and BlocBuilder together.

Code Without Bloc Consumer:
BlocListener&lt;BlocA, BlocAState&gt;(
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is Success) {
      Navigator.push(context,
       MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) =&gt; const SecondRoute()),
     );
    }
  },
  child: BlocBuilder&lt;BlocA, BlocAState&gt;(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is Loading) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    }
  }
 ),
)

Code using Bloc Consumer:
BlocConsumer&lt;BlocA, BlocAState&gt;(
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is Success) {
      Navigator.push(context,
       MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) =&gt; const SecondRoute()),

75409618,Make crawlers read header meta tags after page has finished loading Nuxt,"I am using Nuxt for a website where we have different content types like events, blog articles etc.
We have an API where the content is being pulled from, so for example, if a new article is written, it will show up in the API and then show up as a dynamic route on the nuxt app.
We have SEO tags, like title, keywords, description, image etc. And also og meta tags for Facebook and such. I am using the nuxt-seo plugin https://nuxt-seo.frostbutter.com/
The meta tags loads correctly in the browser when testing and on Facebook. However, for the dynamic routes, because the content is pulled from the API, the header meta tags are only updated once the content is pulled in, i.e. once the page has finished loading. However, Facebook grabs the meta header tags as soon as it can (which will only be the default header tags) and does not wait for the page to finish loading so that it can read the updated correct meta tags.
Is there anything one can do to force crawlers to wait for the page to finish loading before grabbing the meta tag info in the headers?
Thanks
","nuxt.js, web-crawler, seo, facebook-opengraph",-1,75436326,"I figured out what my mistake was. I was fetching my content in the mounted part of the page lifecycle. So I was loading default seo tags inside my head() function and then updating them after loading content from mounted().
I moved my code to the asyncData function, which now fetches the data before the page loads. This also then ensures that the correct meta tags are available and ready for crawlers to read once the page is finished loading.
See example below:
This is correct:
async asyncData({ $seo, params, store }) {
  ...
  content = fetch content here from store or api.
  ...

74708210,reverse a queue using an empty queue,"I have a queue [3,2,1] and I want to reverse it using only enqueue and dequeue functions. My final queue should be [1,2,3].
I cannot declare any local variables. I only have 2 queues one is empty and the other has data in it. I want to reverse the queue which has data using the empty queue only. I don't have access to the pointers of the queue.
I only have 1 global variable, but I can't declare local variables otherwise it can be done easily by recursion. And I don't have peek back and pop back function either. Only have enqueue, dequeue, length, empty and front.
Is this possible?
queue1 = [3,2,1]
queue2 = []

final result
queue1 = [1,2,3]
queue2 = []

","algorithm, language-agnostic",1,74708991,"It seems crucial you have one global variable to use. So let that be a number which can be used for looping.
The idea is to rotate queue1 (dequeue + enqueue) until it has its (originally) last element first. Then this one can be transferred to queue2. Now queue1 looks like it was originally, but without its last element. Repeat this procedure until it is empty.
This gives the desired result in queue2. As it was asked to get the result in queue1, we can first move all elements from queue1 into queue2, except the last one. And then we can apply the above described procedure on queue2 and make the transfer of the wanted element to queue1.
global i

reverse(queue1):
    queue2 = new Queue()
 
    repeat queue1.length-1 times:
        queue2.equeue(queue1.dequeue())
    repeat until queue2.empty():
        for i = queue2.length-1 downto 1:
            queue2.equeue(queue2.dequeue())
        queue1.enqueue(queue2.dequeue())

Here is an implementation in runnable JavaScript snippet (push = enqueue, shift = dequeue):


let i; // One global variable
let queue1 = [];
let queue2 = [];
// Populate the first queue
for (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
    queue1.push(i);
}
console.log(...queue1);
// Start of the reversal algorithm
// Move all but the last element to the other queue
while (queue1.length &gt; 1) {
    queue2.push(queue1.shift());
}
while (queue2.length &gt; 0) {
    // Rotate queue2 to bring last element at the front
    for (i = queue2.length-1; i &gt; 0; i--) {
        queue2.push(queue2.shift());
    }
    // Move that front element to the first queue
    queue1.push(queue2.shift());

75801284,Kafka partitions' have no leaders,"
The specified topic is being used in an application.

Does the topic effectively has only 3 partitions? So the applications producing data into this topic produce them inside these 3 partitions?
Does the topic have 18 partitions, but the messages getting sent into the 15 leader-less partitions are in some limbo or getting lost?
Finally, how can this be resolved.

I have tried looking around but i am not sure what are the cause and effects of so many partitions (15 out of 18) having no leader.
",apache-kafka,0,75807440,"
Your image shows 18 partitions, not 3. The cluster will only accept requests to those 3 working topics with leaders, so &quot;effectively&quot;, yes. However, Kafka producers hash data into any partition by default, and will not select only those with leaders.

The topic has replication factor of 1. Every Leader: None output means no data can be written to them, not only partition 15. In fact, partition 15 should be working, since it does have a leader.

You fix it by recovering the broker(s) where those partitions existed (perhaps Kafka process crashed on those machines?). Looks like you have a cluster of at least 9 brokers. Then, you can use kafka-reassign-partitions.sh to increase replication factor of that topic to at least 3 brokers.

        'CountByGroup':[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]}

pd.DataFrame(data)

This creates the following table:
Group   Status  CountByGroup
AGroup  Low     1
AGroup  Low     2
AGroup  High    1

CGroup  Low     1
CGroup  Low     2
CGroup  High    1
CGroup  High    2

The CountByGroup column is what I am trying to create. Here you can see that &quot;Low&quot; appeared once so far for the &quot;AGroup&quot; in the first row, so it has an entry of 1. &quot;Low&quot; directly follows the same entry &quot;Low&quot; in the second row, so it has an entry of 2. If it were to appear a third time in a row in the third row, CountByGroup would display an entry of 3.
We're also grouping these &quot;Group&quot;, so the first entry for a new group is always 1 since it is the first time any entry has appeared for the group.
This was solved in a previous question I had using R which is available here, but I'm not sure how to solve this using Python.
","python, pandas, dataframe",1,75667389,"Usually, you would use cumsum on the row differences to identify continuous blocks. Then you can group by the Group and the Block then cumcount:
# assuming data is sorted by Group as in the example
blocks = df['Status'].ne(df['Status'].shift()).cumsum()
df['CountByGroup'] = df.groupby(['Group', blocks]).cumcount() + 1

Note if the data is not sorted by Group, you would need to sort before creating the blocks:
blocks = df['Status'].ne(df.sort_values('Group', kind='stable')['Status'].shift()).cumsum()

or a groupby:
blocks = df['Status'].ne(df.groupby('Group')['Status'].shift()).cumsum()

Output:

Well, for Web Service integration within the asp.net core project regardless of version there are two prerequisite:
Prerequisite:

Either your web service must be running and URL should available for calling
Or must have Valid WSDL file in local machine.

Common Implementation For Both:
Following steps would be same for both asmx and wsdl integration.
In addition, please be sure that, I have used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022
Version 17.3.6 while preparing this answer.
Step:1

Step:2

Step:3

Implementation Using asmx URL:

Note: If your Web Service up and running it will start adding the reference without any issue.
Implementation Using WSDL file:


Note: You should select path for your valid wsdl file here. Ignore my files here, you outght to choose your wsdl file instead.
Use Your Service Inside Your Web API/MVC Controller
Now, In your Web API project, you could use a service reference added earlier. Like below
Please note that, you should call the method according to the WCF service's method.
        var serviceReference1 = new ServiceReference1.Service1Client();
        var result = await serviceReference1.GetDataAsync(1) ;


If you still encounter any further issue for integration you could refer to our official document for more details here

75022490,Pytorch `torch.no_grad()` doesn't affect modules,"I was under the (evidently wrong) impression from the documentation that torch.no_grad(), as a context manager, was supposed to make everything requires_grad=False. Indeed that's what I intended to use torch.no_grad() for, as just a convenient context manager for instantiating a bunch of things that I want to stay constant (through training). but that's only the case for torch.Tensors it seems; it doesn't seem to affect torch.nn.Modules, as the following example code shows:
with torch.no_grad():
    linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 3)
for p in linear.parameters():
    print(p.requires_grad)

This will output:
True
True

That's a bit counterintuitive in my opinion. Is this the intended behaviour? If so, why? And is there a similarly convenient context manager in which I can be assured that anything I instantiate under it will not require gradient?
",pytorch,1,75023150,"This is expected behavior, but I agree it is somewhat unclear from the documentation. Note that the documentation says :

In this mode, the result of every computation will have
requires_grad=False, even when the inputs have requires_grad=True.

This context disables the gradient on the output of any computation done within the context. Technically, declaring/creating a layer is not computation, so the parameter's requires_grad is True. However, for any calculation you'd do inside this context, you won't be able to compute gradients. The requires_grad for the output of calculation would be False. This is probably best explained by extending your code snippet as below:
with torch.no_grad():
     linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 3)
     for p in linear.parameters():
         print(p.requires_grad)
     out  = linear(torch.rand(10,2))
     print(out.requires_grad)
out = linear(torch.rand(10,2)) 
print(out.requires_grad)

True
True
False
True

Even if the requires_grad for layer parameters is True, you won't be able to compute the gradient as the output has requires_grad False.

orange
3




I want to count the number of cumulative matching products per merchant, then return an adjusted rank (which is the cum total +1). But I only want to count the first group of matching products and only if they start at 1, with the adjusted rank resetting to 1 if the total is not &gt; 2.
In this example the matching pattern would be apple|banana|orange
The ideal output would be a dataframe with the merchant, rank and adjusted rank:




Merchant
Rank
Adjusted Rank




Merchant 1
1
3


Merchant 2
1
4


Merchant 3
1
1




With some help from this post, i've managed to solve the problem. But what I've done feels quite inefficient. Is there a better way to accomplish this?
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

pattern = 'apple|banana|orange'

# Check column contains substring and create bool column
df['Match'] = np.where(df['Product'].str.contains(pattern), True, False)

# perform count on True values, resetting when False 
df['Count'] = df.groupby(df['Match'].astype(int).diff().ne(0).cumsum())['Match'].cumsum()

# filter out False values

filtered = df[df['Match'] != False]

# filter out values where rank != count, as these aren't in the 1st grouping

filtered = filtered.loc[filtered['Rank'] == filtered['Count']]

# get max rank from remaining values

filtered = filtered.groupby('Merchant')['Count'].max().reset_index(name='Adjusted Rank')

# add 1 to ranks to get maximum position, reset ranking to 1 if there aren't 2 concurrent values

filtered['Adjusted Rank'] = np.where(filtered['Adjusted Rank'] &gt; 2, (filtered['Adjusted Rank'] + 1), 1)

# merge dfs, drop columns, drop dupes

df = df.merge(filtered, how='left', on='Merchant').fillna(1)

df = df[['Merchant','Rank','Adjusted Rank']]

df.drop_duplicates('Merchant', inplace=True)

Thanks for any help!

Basically Im trying to make a carousel but with an elastic effect. So itll move to the right 550 px and then after a timeout It'll move 50 px back. After learning how to properly use past state to update new state
It works perfectly but the issue is if you move right really fast and it resets to 0px (crosses last slide it loops back to first one) the state gets messed up and skips over some setState statements. I'm guessing it can solved using promises but I dont have enough experience any help will be appreciated.
Also can a similar effect be recreated using just css or a react library?
","javascript, css, reactjs, react-hooks",2,74907531,"It seems that the occasional mismatch of dist happens because the change of carousel position is not synced with the elastic effect set by a timer.
Perhaps one approach to solve this could be separating the implement of carousel position and elastic effect with different properties, so they are less likely to have conflicts.
The following example uses translateX to control the carousel position and left to control the elastic effect. useEffect is used to listen to changes of carousel position and set timer for the elastic effect, also throttle the &quot;bounce back&quot; if the changes happen too often.
Live demo of below example: stackblitz
The example also refactored the structure a bit so that the component takes some props, including an array images for display, a sizeX value represents the distance to move with each image, also bounce and delay to be specified.
The event is changed to handle the index of images instead of actual dist, hopefully making it easier to maintain.
Example:
const SlideShow = ({ images, sizeX, bounce, delay }) =&gt; {
  const [imageIndex, setImageIndex] = useState(0);
  const [elastic, setElastic] = useState(&quot;none&quot;);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const bounceBack = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      setElastic(&quot;none&quot;);

","javascript, express, visual-studio-code, jsdoc",0,75966508,"I believe the previous answer may in fact be a good solution for you.
JSDoc works with intellisense when applied where a method/function/variable is defined rather than where it's used. Unfortunately, you won't be able to give intellisense to parameters of app.post (including a callback function) as you have it, because you are invoking app.post rather than defining it.
Since the second argument to app.post is a callback function, and you want to have intellisense inside of it, your best bet is probably to define that function separately (instead of passing it as an anonymous function) so you can give it a JSDoc.
Alternatively, you could look into using typescript which has typed intellisense built in for most commonly used packages.

75141541,Bookmarklet to combine portion of current URL with user input (to search Twitter user's tweets),"I often like to search user tweets for specific mentions of specific topics. I think this could be easily done by having a bookmarklet that would pop-up an alert asking for user input, and append that input into a URL, but also include a portion of the current page URL.
For example, if I am on https://www.twitter.com/USERNAME I want to tap a bookmarklet that brings up an alert where I can input a &quot;TERM&quot; and then have the browser go to:
https://twitter.com/search?q=TERM%20(from%3AUSERNAME)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live
I have made simple bookmarklets that go to a URL based on user input, and I have made bookmarklets that automatically redirect based on current URL. But I've never combined these two concepts into one. Clearly my Javascript skill is lacking but I think this type of thing could be very useful in many other similar contexts.
Anyone skillful enough to give it a try?

75672793,How to return custom primitive struct while protocol needs certain conformation to the protocol for escaping the required conformation?,"This is my custom protocol:
public protocol MyProtocol {
  associatedtype Body: MyProtocol

}

and if I want normally make a struct for conforming the protocol that would be like:
struct MyStruct: MyProtocol {
    var body: some MyProtocol {
        
    }
}

As you can see struct needs to conform to protocol and returning the body, since there is no other struct that conform to protocol, I have to make at least one custom primitive struct that it returns Never and use that one very first custom primitive struct for the body of MyStruct. This very first custom primitive cannot have a body and that is the point Xcode knows this the end of searching for body because if there is no custom primitive struct Xcode or my code would be in infinitely loop for looking the body.
So the goal is building a struct that I can pass that to the body MyStruct without having the body to return. If you need an example to understand the question is more like to making Color struct in SwiftUI as a primitive struct for using in our ContentView. The goal of this question is building this very first primitive as said like Color.
",swift,-3,75673639,"Really struggling to understand your use case here but here is something I think moves you in the right direction. &quot;Never&quot; as I understand it is effectively a view that never returns and is the end point of SwitfUI view generation behind the scenes. As a view it has a body returning never and so you can conform it to your protocol and then use it as the end of chain return you are looking for. Hard to test or understand further without context of what you are using this for but this code passes checks.
An important update missed originally, is that the final struct body can not have the body called. The Never type means it will never return.... To comply with this you need something in the getter eg. fatalError() which will terminate the app if called.
public protocol MyProtocol {
  associatedtype Body: MyProtocol
  var body: Self.Body { get }

ThumbSnap offers a free API that can be used to upload and host images and videos programmatically.
This is the main API method used to upload images to ThumbSnap
Required fields:
media - Binary image/video data. Should be sent as an HTTP POST formatted as multipart/form-data
key - The API key provided by ThumbSnap
Upon successfully posting an image, a JSON-formatted document will be returned with a 'url' which is the full URL to the uploaded photo's page at ThumbSnap. This URL must be linked to any ThumbSnap-hosted thumbnails or images used by your application.
Sample Response
A successful image upload will return a JSON document as follows:
{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;soLHmGdX&quot;,

            portfolioItemImageMapper.asDTO(portfolioItemImageService.save(portfolioItemImage))
    );
}

with that said when I try it out in PostMan REST Client for sending post request to above endpoint I get error:
{
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;EXECUTION&quot;,
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException$BadRequest: 400 Bad Request: \&quot;No API key specified. Upload stopped\&quot;&quot;
}

The ScreenShot is below:

I have checked API_KEY a zillion times, but in-vain.
The Question is:
Is there any problem with following code:
MultiValueMap&lt;String, Object&gt; body = new LinkedMultiValueMap&lt;&gt;();
body.add(&quot;key&quot;, THUMB_SNAP_API_KEY);
body.add(&quot;media&quot;, new ByteArrayResource(imageData) {
    @Override
    public String getFilename() {
        return filename;
    }
});

HttpEntity&lt;MultiValueMap&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; requestEntity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(body, headers);
restTemplate.getMessageConverters().add(new MultiPartMessageConverter(objectMapper));

ResponseEntity&lt;ThumbSnapResponseDTO&gt; response =
        restTemplate.exchange(
                THUMB_SNAP_BASE_URL,
                HttpMethod.POST,
                requestEntity,
                ThumbSnapResponseDTO.class
        );

Or there is any other way to accomplish this. How can I send request correctly can you please suggest a solution to this.
","spring-boot, multipartform-data, spring-resttemplate",1,74976777,"As for as the above code is concerned, every thing looks fine except @PostMapping. You have to change that line as follows:
@PostMapping(path = &quot;/{userId}/upload&quot;,
            consumes =  MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_VALUE,
            produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE
    )

The consume attribute is used to specify the types of media that the method can process in the request body. The MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_VALUE value indicates that the method can accept data in multipart/form data format, which is commonly used for file upload operations, where as the value MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE indicates that the method can return data in application/json format.
And now It should work as intended/expected.

in process of creating a simple flutter app which calculate the value of text/number entered in textformfield to single digit number by assigning A=1 to Z=26
Ex: if input is Hello then output should be 7

it is not calculating to single digit,
it is not calculating for numbers,

75584772,Hiding Custom Layer in Mapbox creates a White Map,"I have several 3D models (animated arrows) that I dynamically add to the map as a user clicks on buttons. Some buttons may have 3D models, while others do not.
Whenever I click on a button that does not have any 3D model, I remove all previously added models:
    function clearMapAnimations() {
        console.log(&quot;CLEARING MAP ANIMATIONS&quot;);
        // Loop through all layers with arrows and hide them
        toggleableLayerIds.forEach(layer =&gt; {
    
            const layer_name = &quot;layer_&quot; + layer;
            console.log (&quot;Layer visibility is none: &quot; + layer_name);
            map.setLayoutProperty(layer_name, 'visibility', 'none');
        });
    }

The toggleableLayerIds is an array that holds all of the ids of the layers previously added.
If I comment out the map.setLayoutProperty(layer_name, 'visibility', 'none'); the expected behaviour exists.... the arrows/layers remain on the map and the map does not turn white. So, I have narrowed down the problem to this line.
I should also note that when I add a custom layer to the map I make its 'visibility' property 'visible'.
        const arrow_layer = addArrow(lyr_id, map, lng_lat, rot, arrow_length, arrow_type);
        map.addLayer(arrow_layer, 'waterway-label');
        map.setLayoutProperty(lyr_id, 'visibility', 'visible');

The addArrow function does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of assigning the origin, rotation, length of the model, and also deals with the animation.
There is an onRemove: function (map, gl) { } that is not currently implemented. Do I need to do something there if I'm hiding the layer and not removing it?
I appreciate any help you can give me!
Thanks
",mapbox-gl-js,0,75664521,"This took entirely too long for a solution that was quite simple.
After you set the visibility of the layer to 'none' you must repaint the map.
    map.setLayoutProperty(layer, 'visibility', 'none');
    map.repaint = true;

For some reason even map.triggerRepaint() did not work, however setting the repaint property to true does.
Some other things I tried that did not work:
When dealing with configuration of the custom layer for a 3D model per the CustomLayerInterface, you must make sure your map's projection is in 'mercator' projection. Otherwise you will get some strange behaviours including your entire map going blank. I tried changing the projection to 'mercator' when the 3D models were on the map, and when those layers were removed changing it to a different type of projection (did not work).
I also read somewhere that the custom layers must have IDs that can be cast into integers (even though they are stored as strings), but I have found no difference when doing that with strings ('layer_1') as opposed to integers ('1').
One strange behaviour is that when I printed out the layers right after I added a custom layer, the custom layer was not printed out in the list:

But for now, I can't even change the page by tapping on the widget let alone animating it. I tried a similar approach to this video and initially I was able to make it work but just till the point where I could change the pages from BottomNavigationBar and by swiping the pages (which I could do normally too) but when I tried to apply it to change the values using the Widget, I wasn't able to. It did not give any errors but  it simply did nothing. I am unable to share the code now as I tried way too many things and now its a complete mess, Please mention if the code is an important requirement I will rewrite it and attach.
Note: If for the animation part somehow you can give me a way with Hero Widget it would be the best as with or without Hero I am trying to achieve the same animation as Hero would provide. I have only seen Hero being used with pictures, I don't know if other widgets are possible.
I tried the solution mentioned in this StackOverflow answer it works but it opens a new page for me on top of the current page. This defeats the purpose I want to later incorporate which is animating the widget. Or if you can give me a way to solve it with that method will also be helpful.

Both objects are in a list and I want to print all the objects.NAME only

75003039,"Is multi-processing, compared with multi-threading, just a way to gain more cpu resources?","Multi-processing utilizes multi-core CPU by distributing tasks to many processes. This makes CPU handle &quot;this program's tasks&quot; more frequently, since different core can load different process and executes at the same time. On the other hand, my understanding of multi-threading is that different threads from the same process can also be loaded to different CPU cores to run concurrently. So if we put inter-process/inter-thread communication aside, is multi-processing just a way to gain more cpu resources? I use both techniques without fully understanding what happens at firmware/hardware level...
Let's say, I have a program handling a bunch of totally CPU-bound tasks with same body and different parameters. These tasks can be fully parallelly processed. What would be different if I use multi-processing (N processes) vs multi-threading (N threads)?
","multithreading, multiprocessing",3,75003306,"When it comes to pure computational power in average computers, there is usually no difference in performance, they are both ways to utilize multiple cores. (IPC and startup overhead aside)
When it comes to HPC (high performance computing), multiple processes can have different resources allocated to each process, (each NUMA node in a NUMA cluster has its own private memory), which achieves higher throughput by less resources contention (including cores contention), NUMA nodes aside, you can also pin each process to certain cores, for time-critical applications where you cannot rely on the OS scheduler to prioritize your process, and manage the priority of each process manually.
similar functionality can be done on threads in some systems, but it requires major code modifications, while the process-based approach is simpler and more portable.
Having multiple processes allows scalability and isolation

later on you can have each process working on a different computer, which is connected over the network (cluster computing)
you have better error handling in case one worker fails or crashes (kubernetes)
you can have each team working on a different &quot;process&quot; in your application.

In short, threads are useful if you are doing a small computation concurrently or need the shared address space for low latency, but if you are doing an application-scale computation, then it's best to isolate it in its own Process/Application, this is how most simulators work, in such applications both multiprocessing and multithreading go hand-in-hand, so you have multiple processes each with its own multiple threads.

Remove references to inline margin and create a basic CSS Grid parent .sometables, which gets stretched to fill its parent (assumably body) and add some convenient spacing between the two child elements (table) with column-gap (where any preferred value will do).
Notice the removal of margin definitions...
Update the CSS grid needs a grid-template-columns definition to show the tables side-by-side instead of stacked on top of eachother. Each table gets 1fr (one fraction) of the total space available.

74694970,How to extract JSON element within an Arel query on Postgres (Rails 5.2.4)?,"I defined a helper to feed a drop down select field in a HTML form.
I have a quite simple query, except that the name field has the JSON data type. It contains a name translated in several languages:
{&quot;en&quot;:&quot;New&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;:&quot;Nouveau&quot;, &quot;de&quot;:&quot;Neue&quot;}

With PostgreSQL, extracting the desired translation is strait forward. The case here is simple, and the -&gt;&gt; operator, when passed the JSON key, returns directly a text data :
SELECT  parameters.id, 
parameters.code, 
parameters.sort_code, 
parameters.property, 
name -&gt;&gt; 'en' as name 
FROM dqm_app.parameters 
WHERE parameters.parameters_list_id = 3

I tried to reproduce the query with Arel syntax:
options = Parameter.
            select(:id, 
                   :code, 
                   :sort_code, 
                   :property, 
                   Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral.new(&quot;name -&gt;&gt; 'en' as name&quot;)).
            where(&quot;parameters_list_id = ?&quot;, 3)

Unfortunately, even though the generated query is identical to the SQL query, this returns a null value for the name field, or no value if I omit the as name statement.
Note: When writing the query without Arel statement, the result is the same:
options = Parameter.
            select(&quot;id, code, sort_code, property, (name -&gt;&gt; 'en') as name&quot;).
            where(&quot;parameters_list_id = ?&quot;, 3)

I am suspecting that the model is waiting for a JSON data, but gets a text for the name field, and doesn't know how to manage it.
How can I solve this?
Thanks a lot!
","json, ruby-on-rails, postgresql, arel",0,74723017,"According to the PostgreSQL documentation, extracting a text from a simple JSON uses the operator -&gt;&gt; in the form:

json -&gt;&gt; text → text
jsonb -&gt;&gt; text → text
Extracts JSON object field with the given key, as text.
'{&quot;a&quot;:1,&quot;b&quot;:2}'::json -&gt;&gt; 'b' → 2

But in the case described above, where Rails expects a JSON field, the syntax that works is name -&gt; 'en'. The value returned by this form has the JSON data type from the PostgreSQL point of view, and results in the expected String attribute after Rails processing the returned value.
The solution to my issue is:
options = Parameter.
            select(&quot;id, code, sort_code, property, (name -&gt; 'en') as name&quot;).

","powershell, environment-variables",1,74765411,"boxdog has provided the crucial pointers in a comment:

Given PowerShell's command precedence, aliases, cmdlets, functions and, on Windows, even scripts (located in $env:PATH)[1] take precedence over external programs (executables).

Therefore, once your module has been imported, it's grep command should preempt grep.exe.

However, PowerShell's auto-loading mechanism does not trigger import of modules containing a command with a given name, if a command with that name is already available, notably in the form of an external program.


In other words: For your grep module's grep command to preempt grep.exe, you must ensure that your module has been imported first.
To do that implicitly, as part of a single command, you can do the following, using a module-name prefix:
# Use module prefix 'grep\' to explicitly target a command in it.
# This automatically triggers the module's import, if not already loaded.
grep\grep ...


If you want to be able to use grep as-is to invoke your module function, you must ensure that your module is imported first, which you can achieve in one of two ways, via your $PROFILE file (but note that profile loading can be bypassed via the PowerShell CLI with -NoProfile):

Unconditionally import your module on startup:

Place the following in your $PROFILE file:
Import-Module grep




Define an alias on startup, which explicitly references the module function, as above, which triggers implicit importing only at the time the alias is first invoked in a session:

Place the following in your $PROFILE file:
Set-Alias grep grep\grep






[1] On Windows, unless an .exe file is invoked with its extension, PowerShell gives precedence to .ps1 files with a given (extension-less) name. On Unix-like platforms, where executables usually do not have filename extensions, the latter take precedence.

75915623,Distance to circumference of circle from any point and angle within the circle,"Technically it's a math problem, but I don't understand how to turn it into code.

I have the center C of a circle, its radius r, and points A and B within the circle. I need to find the distance AD, so B is only used for the angle. So this means solving the triangle ACD with angles and sides calculated from 3 points.
In other words, I want to find the distance to the circumference of the circle from any point within the circle, with an angle.
Pseudo-code of what I tried:
float dis(float a_x, float a_y, float b_x, float b_y, float c_x, float c_y, float r) {
  float ab_x = a_x - b_x;
  float ab_y = a_y - b_y;

  float ac_x = a_x - c_x;
  float ac_y = a_y - c_y;

  float ab_a = atan(ab_y, ab_x);
  float ac_a = atan(ac_y, ac_x);
  float dc_a = pi - ac_a - ab_a;

  return (sin(dc_a) * r) / sin(ab_a);
}

This produced wrong results probably because of more than one mistake.
How does one do it correctly?
I read about it in math exchange, eventually learned that it's a simple triangle, but with programming context I couldn't find questions that answered mine.
","math, language-agnostic, trigonometry",1,75917977,"You could approach this as follows:
First, we can translate (&quot;move&quot;) the given points such that 𝐶 has coordinates (0, 0). So we subtract 𝐶 from both 𝐴 and 𝐵. This does not influence the solution. So now we only have 𝐴 and 𝐵 as inputs.
Secondly we can scale the problem such that the radius of the circle is 1. This means we divide both 𝐴 and 𝐵 by the current radius (by |𝐴|).
The line through 𝐴 and 𝐵 can be written as 𝐴 + 𝑛(𝐵−𝐴) where 𝑛 is variable. Let's call 𝑊=𝐵−𝐴, and let's normalise 𝑊 so it has size 1 (Here we must assume that 𝐴 and 𝐵 are different points). Then we have the following equations that must be satisfied to determine the value of 𝑚:
      𝐷 = 𝐴 + 𝑚𝑊  (𝐷 lies on the line through 𝐴 and 𝐵), and
      |𝐷| = 1     (𝐷 lies on the unit circle)
To ease calculations we can replace the second equation with:
      |𝐷|² = 1
Substituting 𝐷, we get:
      |𝐴 + 𝑚𝑊|² = 1
      (𝐴𝑥 + 𝑚𝑊𝑥)² + (𝐴𝑦 + 𝑚𝑊𝑦)² = 1
      𝐴𝑥² + 2𝑚𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝑚²𝑊𝑥² + 𝐴𝑦² + 2𝑚𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦 + 𝑚²𝑊𝑦² = 1
      𝐴𝑥² + 𝐴𝑦² + 2𝑚(𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦) + 𝑚²(𝑊𝑥² + 𝑊𝑦²) = 1
      (𝑊𝑥² + 𝑊𝑦²)𝑚² + 2(𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦)𝑚 + 𝐴𝑥² + 𝐴𝑦² − 1 = 0
Now 𝐴𝑥² + 𝐴𝑦² is |𝐴|², which we already determined to be 1 when we scaled the problem (If we choose 𝑚=0, then 𝐷 = 𝐴 + 𝑚𝑊 becomes 𝐷 = 𝐴, and |𝐷|² = |𝐴|² = 1). So the above simplifies to:
      (𝑊𝑥² + 𝑊𝑦²)𝑚² + 2(𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦)𝑚 = 0
The line 𝐴𝐵 crosses the circle twice (in general), and when 𝑚 is zero we have 𝐴. We want the non-zero 𝑚 (if there is a second crossing), and so we divide the equation by 𝑚:
      (𝑊𝑥² + 𝑊𝑦²)𝑚 + 2(𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦) = 0
      𝑚 = −2(𝐴𝑥𝑊𝑥 + 𝐴𝑦𝑊𝑦)/(𝑊𝑥² + 𝑊𝑦²)
Finally, because we scaled the problem to a unit circle, the found value for 𝑚 needs to be scaled back to the original problem.
Here is an implementation in JavaScript:


// Utility functions to work with 2D vectors:
function sub(u, v) {
    return [u[0] - v[0], u[1] - v[1]];
}

function mul(u, m) { // Scalar multiplication
    return [m * u[0], m * u[1]];
}

function size(u) {
    return Math.sqrt(u[0] * u[0] + u[1] * u[1]);
}

function norm(u) { // Resize vector to size 1
    return mul(u, 1 / size(u));
}

function solve(a, b, c) {
    // Translate problem to C at (0, 0): this does not influence the result
    a = sub(a, c);
    b = sub(b, c);
    // Scale problem to Unit circle
    const r = size(a);
    a = mul(a, 1/r);
    b = mul(b, 1/r);
    // Define W as the direction vector of the line A-B, with size 1.
    const w = norm(sub(b, a));
    // Solve equation to find m, such that D = A+mW and |D|² is 1, i.e.
    // |A+mW|² = 1, or 
    // (Ax+mWx)²+(Ay+mWy)² = 1, or 
    // (Ax)² + 2mAxWx + m²(Wx)² + (Ay)² + 2mAyWy + m²(Wy)² = 1, or
    // (Ax)²+(Ay)² - 1 + 2m(AxWx+AyWy) + m²((Wx)²+(Wy)²) = 0
    // As (Ax)²+(Ay)² = 1, we can eliminate (Ax)²+(Ay)² - 1.
    // m=0 is a solution. But we want to get the other root. 
    // So divide the equation by m, and solve by m:
    const m = -2 * (a[0] * w[0] + a[1] * w[1]) / (w[0] * w[0] + w[1] * w[1]);
    // Scale the solution back to the original size
    return m * r; // This is a signed number. For distance, take absolute value
}

// Demo 
const dist = solve([3, 5], [6, 6], [5, 10]);
console.log(dist);



Here is an interactive version where points 𝐴 and 𝐶 are fixed, but 𝐵 corresponds to where the mouse pointer is. You can then see the distance as you move the mouse pointer, and the corresponding line segement.

Although the code above works, the closed windows are never deallocated and keep piling up in the memory.
If I remove the windowController assignment, the app crashes when I try to close the windows with EXC_BAD_ACCESS, and using the profiler, I can see the window was actually deallocated:
An Objective-C message was sent to a deallocated 'NSWindow' object (zombie) at address...
So I believe the windowController instance is the culprit and is never being destroyed.
How can I implement a proper NSWindow lifecycle for programmatically created windows?
","swift, macos, nswindow",0,75350237,"The deallocation of NSWindow is a bit complicated for historical reasons. From the documentation of NSWindow.close():

If the window is set to be released when closed, a release message is sent to the object after the current event is completed. For an NSWindow object, the default is to be released on closing, while for an NSPanel object, the default is not to be released. You can use the isReleasedWhenClosed property to change the default behavior.

From the documentation of isReleasedWhenClosed:

The value of this property is true if the window is automatically released after being closed; false if it’s simply removed from the screen.

The default for NSWindow is true; the default for NSPanel is false. Release when closed, however, is ignored for windows owned by window controllers. Another strategy for releasing an NSWindow object is to have its delegate autorelease it on receiving a windowShouldClose(_:) message.
If you own the window then isReleasedWhenClosed should be false and the window controller can be removed.

75198599,what is different between custom event by colon vs dot,"i try JavaScript and jQuery (i know jQuery is old but it is just for learning), i create a tools and i need activate some functions by triggered events, this is easy but the problem is custom event names and i don't know what is different between this 4 lines:
1: test.run
2: test:run
3: run.test
4: run:test
question A: they are same?
question B: what is different?
question C: which one is better to used?
question D: if i trigger &quot;run&quot; without &quot;test&quot; which one is triggered?
(for example name space is &quot;test&quot; and event name is &quot;run&quot;)
","javascript, triggers",1,75198771,"A: They are not the same.
B: &quot;test:run&quot; has no special meaning. According to the docs:

You can use any name for a custom event, however you should beware of creating new events with names that might be used by future DOM events. For this reason, in this article we have chosen to use light: for all of our event names, as events with colons are unlikely to be used by a future DOM spec.

&quot;test.run&quot;, on the other hand, consists of jQuery's concept of namespaces, which are not present in native JS events. It comes under the root event &quot;test&quot;, so if you fire the event &quot;test&quot;, anything under the namespace &quot;test&quot; will be fired as well, including &quot;test.run&quot; or &quot;test.run.somethingelse&quot;. If you fire the event &quot;test.run&quot;, however, only &quot;test.run&quot; will be fired, as well as its sub-events.
C: There's not necessarily a better one, just one is used for special purposes, i.e. namespaces.
D: Apparently spaces is another way to write namespaces instead of using dots.

75794776,"How do I return a reference in rust, that is automatically dereferenced","Let's say I have the struct:
struct Vector {
    data: [f32; 2]

Implementing the Index trait is easy:
impl IndexMut&lt;usize&gt; for Vector {
    fn index_mut(&amp;mut self, index: usize) -&gt; &amp;mut Self::Output {
        &amp;mut self.data[index]

    fn y....

Technically I can do it, but each time I want to actually set the value of x() I need to dereference it: *v.x() = 7 works, but I would like v.x() = 7 to also work.
When I try to second one I get the error: consider dereferencing here to assign to the mutably borrowed value: '*', which I guess makes sense, but it's weird that it happens, since IndexMut returns the same mutable reference that my x() function returns.
So my question is: Why does the IndexMut trait work to just do v[0] = 7, but my function needs to be dereferenced before using the value, and how (if even possible) should I do it?
","rust, indexing, struct, reference, traits",1,75794941,"v[0] = 7 doesn't need dereferencing because v[0] is syntax sugar for *v.index(0) or *v.index_mut(0) depending on how it's used*, that is the compiler automatically inserts the dereference wherever you use the indexing syntax, this is presumably done so indexing works the same as in other languages and is a little easier to use.
As far as I know there is no way to get the same behaviour for your own method.

Just try to create the table and then catch the exception if it already exists.
Your DDL statement is 'CREATE TABLE V_STUDENTS AS SELECT * FROM V_STUDENTS WHERE 1=2; '; If v_students does not exist then you cannot select from it to create it; you need to select from an existing table such as students. (Also the trailing semi-colon is a syntax error in a dynamic SQL statement and should be removed.)
If the table does not exist when the statement is compiled then you will get a compile-time error if you try to insert into a non-existent table. If you are using dynamic SQL to create the table then you also need to use dynamic SQL to perform the insert.
You do not need to use cursors; just use INSERT ... SELECT ...
Catching the OTHERS exception is considered bad practice. Explicitly catch the exceptions you expect to be throw (like a table already existing when you try to create it) and don't catch all the other exceptions so that if something unexpected happens then you know about it.

Like this:
BEGIN
  DECLARE

Lets assume a graph with nodes representing people and edges of type 'has child'.
I get a subset of the people as starting point and I need to find all the descendants (recursively). More specifically, I am only interested in the edges:
Example:
a -&gt; b -&gt; c
d -&gt; b
(starting points = [c]) =&gt; []
(starting points = [b]) =&gt; [b-&gt;c]
(starting points = [a,b,c]) =&gt; [a-&gt;b, b-&gt;c]

So far, I got to this query:
g.V().has('name', 'something'). // this line gets replaced by various filters
repeat(outE('child').dedup().inV()).
until(
    outE('child').count().is(eq(0))
).
path(). // get all paths
unfold(). // flatten the list of lists
filter(hasLabel('child')). // filter out only edges
dedup()

However this query does not work properly, if we select more starting points on the same path (an example can be selecting all vertices by doing g.V()....)

","python, pandas",0,75426979,".contains uses regex (by default), not just a raw string. And $ means the end of the line in regex (intuitively or not, all strings have &quot;the end&quot;). To check the symbol &quot;$&quot; you need to escape it:
dates.str.contains('\$').all()

Or you can use regex=False argument of the .contains():
dates.str.contains('$', regex=False).all()

Both options return False.

75119837,Multiple NavigationViews in SwiftUI - How to get rid of multiple toolbar items (i.e the back-button on the left corner)?,"I am making an app where the first view the users see is a home screen with buttons that takes them to a second view. One of the second views present the user with a list of items. When the user clicks on one of these items the user comes to a detailed view of the item. When the user comes to the detailed view he is unfortunately presented with two toolbar buttons in the corner as can be seen here:
.
I know that one of the solutions is to only have one navigationview and that solves my problem. But I need to have toolbar items in my listview to be able to add more items, sort the list and have the list searchable which I'm not able to do without navigationView. I Have tried using scrollView and NavigationStack but it comes out blank.
Does anyone have an idea how to work with mulitple views, not getting double up &quot;back buttons&quot; on the toolbar and still have other toolbar items?

75903800,React Raising an event from child component to parent component,"I am fairly new to both JS and react and was trying to learn it via a Youtube tutorial that was from 4 years ago, so there may be some changes to the code that I am unaware of. I have looked at other similar posts on a similar issue and I have not found a solution to my problem in them.
We were writing a shopping cart app and we had a Counters class that holds multiple objects from the Counter class. For each counter component we had a span element and two button elements, one to increment the number in the span element and one to delete the component itself. We just started implementing the delete button and tried to log to the console to see if the button was responsive. This is where I ran into some issues. When I checked the component in my react developer tools extension I got that the onDelete event is undefined, and when I clicked the button nothing happened. I have specified a function to handle the event in the parent component.
Here are my code:


How should I write the code to properly raise an event by the Child component and for the parent component to listen and respond accordingly?
","javascript, reactjs, events",0,75903811,"The problem is a typo in your Counters component, you write
onDelete={this.handlDelete}
where it should be
onDelete={this.handleDelete}
and as a tip, the current &quot;go to&quot; way of doing react is by using react function component with hooks, not classes anymore, so you may want to change your code.
and another thing, this kind of typo bug won't happen if you are using typescript, so I also suggest you to try to learn it 😉

75346885,Swift Tests: Spying on `Encoder`?,"I have some Swift models that encode data to json. For example:
struct ExampleModel: Encodable {
    var myComputedProperty: Bool { dependentModel.first(where: { $0.hasTrueProperty}) }

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case firstKey = &quot;first_key&quot;
        case secondKey = &quot;second_key&quot;
        case myComputedProperty = &quot;my_computed_property&quot;
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(firstKey, forKey: .firstKey)
        try container.encode(myComputedProperty, forKey: .myComputedProperty)
    }
}

The encoded data is sent to an API, and cross-platform system tests in this case are logistically tricky, so it's important I write tests that ensure the encoded data is as expected. All I'm looking to do is ensure container.encode receives expected keys and values.
I'm somewhat new to Swift, and trying to override the container, its dependencies &amp; generics, and its .encode method is taking me down a rabbit-hole of rewriting half Swift's encoding foundation. In short: the spy I'm writing is too complex to be useful.
Despite lack of Google/StackOverflow results, I'm guessing spying on encoders is common (?), and that there's an easier way to confirm container.encode receives expected values. But the way swift's Encoder functionality is written is making it hard for me to do so without rewriting half the encoder. Anyone have boilerplate code or an example of effectively spying on container.encode?
","swift, testing, mocking, xctest",0,75347169,"I have never done tests spying on encoder, although I have plenty of tests checking correction of encoding/decoding.
There are multiple ways to do it:

You can get something like SwiftyJSON and inspect encoded JSON
You can use OHHTTPStubs to mock sending a request to API, and examine the request the way it's sent (this allows to examine not only JSON, but headers as well)

But the most basic way to test is encoding and then decoding your data structure, and comparing the structures. They should be identical.
How it's done:

Create a Decodable extension for your struct (or if your struct is Codable, then you already ave this). It can be added directly in the test class / test target if you don't need it in the production code:

extension ExampleModel: Decodable {
    
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        firstKey = try container.decode(&lt;...&gt;.self, forKey: .firstKey)
        // etc
    }
}


Add Equatable extension for the struct:

extension ExampleModel: Equatable {
    // Rely on synthesized comparison, or create your own
}


Add a test:

let given = ExampleModel(firstKey: ..., ...)
let whenEncoded = try JSONEncoder().encode(given)
let whenDecoded = try JSONDecoder().decode(ExampleModel.self, from: whenEncoded)
// Then
XCTAssertEqual(given, whenDecoded)

Couple of notes:

It's very unusual to encode computed property. It's not prohibited, but it breaks the immutability of the property you are about to send to API: what if it changes after you called encode, but before it was sent to API? Better solution is to make a let property in the struct, but have an option to create a struct with this value given with appropriate calculation (e.g. init for ExampleModel could be passing the dependentModel, and the property would be calculated in the init once)
If you still choose to have a calculated property, you obviously cannot decode into it. So in that case you will need to preserve the decoded property in some class variable to compare it separately.

75012061,Improperly formatted json?,"First, I am new to Python and working with JSON.

I understand the key - value pair concept but I am unsure how to reference the key-value I want. I think it has something to do with the response having multiple objects having the same kay names. Or maybe the first line &quot;Bookmark&quot; is making things goofy.

",python,-1,75136103,"IPv4Network.hosts() will only return the host addresses of an IP-Network, i.e. not the network address (where all host bits are 0), neither the broadcast address (where all host bits are 1). So for a /30-network it will only return two hosts while the network actually covers 4 addresses.
This is in line with the common definition of what a host address is.
From the python documentation:

hosts()
Returns an iterator over the usable hosts in the network. The usable hosts are all the IP addresses that belong to the network, except the network address itself and the network broadcast address.

Illustration:

Something like this.

As you can see in the dummy code above, the comment suggests what I am trying to achieve. I will pass LoginFormValidator to the function like this.
validateRequest(LoginFormValidator);

How can I do that? Or is there any other alternative to what I am trying to achieve? Basically I don't want the client to create an instance of the class. I would rather create the instance within the validateRequest function instead. The client still should be aware of the contract of RequestValidator.
",typescript,1,75960420,"The (somewhat inconveniently named) documentation section Abstract Construct Signatures shows exactly this use case. Instead of using typeof RequestValidator as the parameter type for validateRequest, you can use a construct signature that produces an instance of a class that derives from RequestValidator (i.e. new () =&gt; RequestValidator). This will allow you to pass LoginFormValidator to  validateRequest and instantiate it there. It will also correctly disallow passing the abstract class.
const validateRequest = (validatorClass: new () =&gt; RequestValidator) =&gt; {
  const requestValidator = new validatorClass()
  const test = requestValidator.getSchema({} as Request)
  // const test: joi.ObjectSchema&lt;any&gt;
}

validateRequest(LoginFormValidator); // Works.
validateRequest(RequestValidator); // Fails on the abstract class, as desired.

TypeScript playground
As I mentioned, the documentation is a bit confusing, since as jcalz pointed out it, it uses a regular construct signature rather than an abstract one. With an abstract construct signature it would be (validatorClass: abstract new () =&gt; RequestValidator) =&gt; .., which is precisely what we don't want here.

74637515,Why is .NET MAUI crashing upon an event handler being activated?,"I am having a strange issue with my .NET MAUI app connected to an API controller and SQL backend. The app successfully accesses the login endpoint of my API and denotes that it logs in (I've confirmed by looking at my SQL db as well as by using Postman). However, once I hit the &quot;login&quot; button on my login page and I am notified that I have logged in, I thereafter call (within the same button event handler) absolute navigation to the home page using
await Shell.Current.GoToAsync($&quot;{nameof(HomePage)}&quot;);
I use absolute shell navigation many other places in my app without issue (though to different pages), but for some reason, on this page, hitting &quot;login&quot; crashes my app immediately. Despite no exception being thrown or error, I have deduced that it is this line doing something wrong... and the app works fine if I remove this line. HomePage is a brand new page and I did register its route in appshell. I am flabergasted and would appreciate you input!

If so, you can register the LoginPage in the shell and use MainPage = new AppShell(). Or you can try to change Shell.Current.GoToAsync($&quot;{nameof(HomePage)}&quot;); in the button clicked event as App.Current.MainPage = new AppShell().
In addition, if I'm wrong, could you please show more code about the Button click event and the shell?

75715631,Can Instancio generate data for interfaces and abstract classes,"I used to use Easy-Random to generate JUnit5 test data, however because it does not seem to be developed anymore, doesn't support Java records and in general seems to be less flexibility than Instancio, I've decided to migrate. Instancio, out of the box, provides a lot of nice features enabling quicker testing (easier parametrized tests, taking into consideration Javax etc.), however there is one drawback.
The objects returned by our persistence layer are auto-generated implementations of some record interface which look like:
interface SomeRecord {
  getUid();
}

Easy-Random was able to find the implementation and generate a random record.
I cannot find any information on how to resolve this or a workaround in Instancio's docs or anywhere else. Has anyone been able to do something similar?

Person person = Instancio.of(Person.class)

Implement the TypeResolver (see InstancioServiceProvider documentation):

class MyTypeResolver implements TypeResolver {

The mapping can be specified manually, or automated by scanning the classpath using a library, such as ClassGraph.

Quick example of getting and updating a confluence page
#login to confluence
confluence = Confluence(
    url='http://confluence',
    username='user',
    password='pass')

#get page id of the page
pid = confluence.get_page_id(space, title)

#get page from page id
conf_page = confluence.get_page_by_id( expand='body.storage', page_id=pid)

#Check contents
contents = conf_page[&quot;body&quot;][&quot;storage&quot;][&quot;value&quot;]

#Stringify the contents
#You can turn this into a beautifulsoup4 object and can then use all the bs4 #methods which can help a lot
conf_string = str(contents)

html_example = &quot;&lt;p&gt;This is an example&lt;p&gt;&quot;

#Add the html example to the contents
conf_string += html_example

#Update the page with the new body
confluence.update_page(
    page_id=pid,
    title=&quot;Example&quot;,
    body=conf_string)

This below code is just an example of BS4 usage with confluence.
This code creates a BS4 object with the contents from confluence, parsed as XML
Then it finds the 3rd (index = 2) table and gets all the rows except the header row.
conf_html = BeautifulSoup(contents, 'xml')
child_soup = conf_html.find_all(&quot;table&quot;)[2]
all_rows = child_soup.find_all(&quot;tr&quot;)[1:]

Edit: As an example:
&lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name=&quot;html&quot; ac:schema-version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ac:plain-text-body&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[{0}]]&gt;
  &lt;/ac:plain-text-body&gt;
&lt;/ac:structured-macro&gt;

The above code is the confluence xml for the html macro. For my program I simply do html_macro.format(example_data). And then I can add that to my confluence page with update_page(), and the html macro with my example data is rendered.
&lt;ac:layout&gt;
&lt;ac:layout-section ac:type=&quot;two_equal&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ac:layout-cell&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Test Report&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;

          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;PN&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;a class=&quot;link-here&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;PN2&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/ac:layout-cell&gt;

Another example of a table in confluence. After creating the Soup object:
soup.find(&quot;a&quot;, {&quot;class&quot;: &quot;link-here&quot;})[&quot;href&quot;] = link_to_plot
This line uses BS4's function to find an a tag with class: &quot;link-here&quot; and then change it's href value.
I manually had to put in classes and ID's in my template xml file to do this. Classes and tags should save on confluence, so if you add them once, it should work every next time.
Hope this helps

75977888,Use Jackson deserializer to read child JSON object,"I have a Spring Boot application with Jackson dependency, and a Service with this code:
Dto dto = new ObjectMapper().readValue(jsonString, Dto.class);

I have a JSON similar to this one:
{
    &quot;meta&quot;: {
    ...
    },
    &quot;results&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;id&quot;: {&quot;raw&quot;: &quot;1&quot;},
            &quot;name&quot;: {&quot;raw&quot;: &quot;Hello World&quot;}
            &quot;number&quot;: {&quot;raw&quot;: 7.5}
        }
    ]
}

And I have a Java class like this one:
public class Dto {
    private AnotherDto meta;
    private List&lt;ResultDto&gt; results;
    // getters/setters
}

public class ResultDto {
    @JsonProperty(&quot;id&quot;)
    private Wrapper&lt;String&gt; id;

    // More fields and getters/setters
}

Then, I have a generic Wrapper class like this one (idea from Baeldung: https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-deserialization ):
@JsonDeserialize(using = WrapperDeserializer.class)
public class Wrapper&lt;T&gt; {
    T value;
    // getters/setters
}

Lastly, I have the next deserializer:
public class WrapperDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer&lt;Wrapper&lt;?&gt;&gt; implements ContextualDeserializer {
    private JavaType type;

    @Override
    public Wrapper&lt;?&gt; deserialize(JsonParser jsonParser, DeserializationContext deserializationContext) throws IOException, JacksonException {
        Wrapper&lt;?&gt; wrapper = new Wrapper&lt;&gt;();
        wrapper.setValue(deserializationContext.readValue(jsonParser, type));
        return wrapper;
    }

    @Override
    public JsonDeserializer&lt;?&gt; createContextual(DeserializationContext deserializationContext, BeanProperty beanProperty) throws JsonMappingException {
        this.type = beanProperty.getType().containedType(0);
        return this;
    }
}

The main doubt is, how I can access to jsonParser object in order to get the child JSON information? In this case, I would like to access {&quot;raw&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}, so I could get the child into raw key and get the proper value, so ID &quot;1&quot; would be saved in final Java object.
I wouldn't want to make deserializationContext.readValue(jsonParser, type) as in this example, because it would throw this error:
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize value of type `java.lang.String` from Object value (token `JsonToken.START_OBJECT`)
 at [Source: 

Because {&quot;raw&quot;: &quot;1&quot;} is not a valid String. I would want to have only the &quot;1&quot; value.
","java, json, spring-boot, jackson, json-deserialization",1,75980261,"You are really close. The main issue is that you used the field name value where it should be raw. Also, the WrapperDeserializer is not required.

        Dto readValue = objectMapper.readValue(json, Dto.class);

If you leave out the endianness from the encoding name (Just UTF-16), iconv uses the BOM (If present) to determine the one being used, and your text will be converted.
Some examples might make it clearer:
